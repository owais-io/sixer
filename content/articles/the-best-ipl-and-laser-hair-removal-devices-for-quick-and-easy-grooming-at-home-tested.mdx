  Tired of waxing, bored by shaving and fed up with ingrown hairs? In the past
  few years, a quiet revolution has taken place in the hair removal market,
  promising to banish stubbly regrowth and take away the pain of waxing and
  epilation. I’m speaking of the growing number of IPL (intense pulsed light)
  devices suitable for home use. Put simply, IPL uses pulses of light to make
  the hair go into its resting phase (stop growing) and fall out. IPL isn’t a
  permanent hair-removal solution like electrolysis, but you should see a
  significant reduction in hair regrowth over time. With the right device, it’s
  also simple to do at home, fairly quick and almost completely painless. I
  tried 10 of the best at-home IPL devices at a range of price points to see
  which left me feeling soft and smooth without stress or mess. *** At a glance
  Best IPL device overall for face and body: Philips Lumea 9900 £449.99 at John

  Silk’n 7 £399.20 at Cult Beauty Best laser hair removal device: CurrentBody
  Skin laser hair removal device £579.99 at Amazon *** Why you should trust me
  I’m new to IPL, but over the past 15 years as a beauty journalist I’ve tested
  my fair share of depilation tools and products. I’ve also been removing hair
  from parts of my body using other methods for well over 30 years, and I’m
  always looking for ways to make the process simpler, quicker and less painful.
  How I tested I tested 10 IPL machines, including corded and cordless models.
  To test, I used each device as directed for three full sessions, focusing on
  the same place every time and keeping a record of how long it took to treat
  each area, how the treated area felt afterwards, and how much regrowth was
  visible after the first, second and third sessions. In my commitment to
  thoroughness (and almost total disregard for the conventions of summer
  dressing), I also left a “control” area untreated, to compare regrowth
  against. I checked the weight and dimensions of each device and noted how easy
  each felt to hold and manoeuvre in normal use. I also used a stopwatch to time
  the flash rate. Finally, I noted the total number of flashes each device can
  produce – an indication of the product lifetime. Any devices not returned to
  the manufacturer after testing were donated for resale to the homelessness
  charity Crisis. Here are the seven best IPL devices from my tests. *** The
  best IPL and laser hair removal devices *** Best IPL device overall for face
  and body: Philips Lumea 9900 £449.99 at John Lewis £436.49 at Amazon Philips
  has been in the IPL game for years – the first Lumea model was launched in
  2010, and this version came out last year. The Lumea 9900 is particularly
  versatile, with five power levels and four attachments for use on the face,
  underarms and body. Why we love it The neatest aspect of the Lumea 9900 is the
  four smart attachments that trigger a suitable light intensity for the
  selected treatment area when fitted: the body attachment covers larger patches
  quickly, while the facial attachment triggers a more gentle intensity suitable
  for sensitive skin. I tested a more expensive version of the 9900 (model
  BRP958) that comes with a separate mini facial hair remover (handy for
  treating peach fuzz), but the version linked above also treats facial hair and
  sensitive areas effectively thanks to the smart attachments that go on the
  main unit. The Lumea 9900 can be used with mains power or cordless; I found
  using it in cordless mode made it easy to reach areas such as under the arms,
  although the flash rate is faster when plugged into the mains. An optional app
  helps with recommended settings for your skin tone and treatment area, and a
  handy treatment schedule tracker. If you’re primarily looking for a leg
  treatment, there are cheaper devices here that are also easier to hold – the
  Lumea’s design is a bit top-heavy and can feel awkward. But if you want to use
  it on your face and multiple body parts, it’s the most versatile device on our
  list. I had good results within a few weeks, with less hair growing back than
  usual. It’s a shame that … with a flash rate of about two seconds a flash, it
  takes more time to move the device over a treatment area, so it’s
  comparatively slow. It takes about 10 minutes to do a half leg with the Lumea,
  compared with five with faster devices. Suitable for dark skin/light hair? No
  Flash rate (timed): two seconds a flash when plugged into mains (slower when
  cordless) Lifetime number of flashes: 450,000 Power levels: five Number of
  attachment heads: four *** Best budget IPL device: No!No! Plus £160 at Argos
  £160 at Amazon The No!No! Plus IPL hair remover is an ultra-simple device for
  anyone unsure about the steep cost of premium options. It’s budget-friendly
  and does the basics with absolutely zero bells and whistles. Why we love it
  Retailing at £160, the Plus has five intensity levels and attachments for
  face, body and bikini areas. In three test sessions on my leg, I saw some
  thinning of the hair and reduced regrowth, although not to the same extent as
  the more powerful models in our list. While the device is easy to use, it
  emits an alarmingly bright flash – there’s a reason a pair of dark glasses is
  included. It also feels somewhat slight and plasticky in comparison with the
  sturdy builds of the other devices. This is very much an entry-level device
  for the IPL-curious; if you don’t fancy spending a ton on hair removal, this
  could be the one for you. It’s a shame that … hair regrowth is not reduced by
  as much as with pricier models; it’s definitely built for value rather than
  quality. Suitable for dark skin/light hair? No Flash rate (timed): two seconds
  per flash Lifetime number of flashes: 300,000 Power settings: five Number of
  attachment heads: two, plus one built in *** Best for ease of use: Bondi Body
  v2 laser @home £299 at Bondi Body Another good choice for IPL and laser
  newcomers, the Bondi Body’s biggest attractions are its neat size and
  foolproof ease of use. Why we love it The V2 IPL device (note that despite the
  name, it’s an IPL, not a laser) is among the more compact models in our test.
  Barely bigger than a typical electric shaver or epilator, the contoured oval
  unit fits nicely in the palm of the hand and is easy to grasp and manoeuvre.
  The V2 doesn’t come with extra heads or attachments, but that makes it simple
  and intuitive to use – just press the flash button and go. There are eight
  intensity settings, so the V2 can be used on both sensitive areas and coarser
  hair – I found level six quite comfortable to use on my leg. Bondi Body
  recommends use up to twice a week on legs and arms, and I found regrowth on my
  test leg noticeably reduced over the testing period. It’s also compact enough
  to join you on your travels. It’s a shame that … the V2 is limited in which
  skin and hair colours it can be used with – like many IPL devices (but not
  all; see the Silk’n below). The three-second flash time is on the slower side,
  so treating a full area takes longer. Suitable for dark skin/light hair? No
  Flash rate (timed): three seconds per flash Lifetime number of flashes:
  400,000 Power levels: eight Number of attachment heads: no additional
  attachments *** Best for all skin and hair types: Silk’n 7 £399.20 at Cult
  Beauty £399.20 at Debenhams Many of the IPL devices in our test can be used
  only on fair to medium skin tones, and with medium to dark hair colours. The
  big appeal of the Silk’n 7 is its skin colour sensor, which calibrates the
  treatment to work on a wider range of skin and hair colours. Why we love it To
  test the skin and hair colour detection, I used the Silk’n 7 on my arm hairs,
  which are a very light blond and not usually suitable for IPL treatment. I
  also tested an area on my leg to compare with our other models. It took both
  areas in its stride, and I did notice slower regrowth on my arm and leg over
  the testing period. The Silk’n 7 has a long, tapered design slightly
  reminiscent of a Dust Buster – the one I tested came in a rather glam pale
  gold colour. The device felt comfortable to hold and easy to use; the rotating
  swivel head makes it easy to reach the more awkward areas of the body, and
  there are attachments for face, body and underarm areas. I also liked the
  optional phone app to help keep track of treatments. It’s a shame that … the
  Silk’n 7 is one of the more expensive products in our test – but good value if
  you have a skin/hair colour combination that the other products on our list
  can’t handle. Suitable for dark skin/light hair? Yes Flash rate (timed): two
  per second Lifetime number of flashes: 600,000 Power levels: five Number of
  attachment heads: three *** Best laser hair removal device: CurrentBody Skin
  laser hair removal device £579.99 at CurrentBody £579.99 at Amazon The
  CurrentBody Skin is the only device here that includes a Class 4 laser diode –
  a more powerful method of at-home epilation, reflected in the price tag. Why
  we love it Unlike other devices tested, the CurrentBody Skin uses a true laser
  instead of scattered IPL light. This means the treatment schedule is a bit
  different: rather than every two weeks or so, the recommendation is to use it
  three times in the first week and weekly thereafter. While this requires a few
  evenings dedicated to treatments in the first few days, there were noticeably
  smoother patches on my test leg after just a couple of weeks. Instead of
  flashing, the device emits a gentle pulse of warm red light; I found there was
  a bit of a knack to seeing when the light had pulsed so that I could move on
  to the next area. The fan that cools the device is also one of the loudest in
  our test, and it’s quite heavy to hold in the hand. However, each individual
  treatment is fast, so you’re not holding it for too long, and after a few
  weeks you won’t need to hold it very often. It’s a shame that … it’s expensive
  compared with other devices on our list, and is heavy to hold – but the fast
  results speak for themselves. Suitable for dark skin/light hair? No Flash rate
  (timed): not applicable Lifetime number of flashes: not applicable Power
  levels: six Number of attachment heads: no additional attachments *** The best
  of the rest *** Foreo Peach 2 £258.30 at John Lewis £202.95 at Amazon Best
  for: comfort Swedish beauty brand Foreo’s cute candy-coloured device is a
  user-friendly product for anyone nervous about trying IPL. The compact unit
  has a colourful silicone casing, which is easy to grip and feels soft as it
  glides over the skin. The large treatment window and fast flash rate of two
  flashes a second mean you can cover large areas quickly and won’t have to
  spend long on each treatment. There’s a downloadable app that guides you
  through the treatment steps, which is handy if you’re new to IPL – although
  the device can be used without. It didn’t make the final cut because … while I
  definitely saw a reduction in regrowth after three sessions, there wasn’t as
  much as with other devices: Foreo recommends 12 weeks’ use for best results.
  The app is useful (and free) but pushes you to spend more on subscription
  plans and upgrades. Suitable for dark skin/light hair? No; flash rate (timed):
  two flashes a second; lifetime number of flashes: 500,000; power settings:
  five; number of attachment heads: no additional attachments *** Braun Silk
  Expert pro 5 £409.99 at Braun £409.99 at Amazon Best for: an all-rounder The
  Braun Silk Expert Pro 5 IPL is a powerful all-in-one device. The big draw here
  is Braun’s SensoAdapt technology, which continuously adjusts the light
  intensity to skin tone so that it’s always using the most effective level for
  fast results. You can also manually select from three power levels, and there
  are two attachment heads: standard for body, and precision for face and
  intimate areas. Results after three sessions were very good, and Braun
  promises up to 95% reduction in hair growth with weekly use in the first four
  to 12 weeks. It didn’t make the final cut because … I slightly preferred the
  Lumea 9900 for ease of use, although this is a sleek and powerful device. The
  Silk Expert Pro 5 is less effective on light hair or dark skin – so you might
  also prefer the Silk’n 7 at this price point. Suitable for dark skin/light
  hair? No; flash rate (timed): two flashes per second; lifetime number of
  flashes: 400,000; power settings: three; number of attachment heads: two ***
  What you need to know *** What is IPL? IPL stands for intense pulsed light – a
  system that uses pulses of light to heat up the hair follicles and cause the
  hair to go into its telogen or “resting” phase. This makes the hair shed (or
  fall out) and grow back more slowly and finer. Laser treatment used in salons
  also heats up the hair follicles to reduce regrowth, but the light used in IPL
  treatments is broad-spectrum and safe for use at home. Although IPL isn’t a
  permanent hair removal treatment, it will significantly reduce hair growth
  over time. IPL can also be used as a skin treatment to reduce
  hyperpigmentation, broken veins and acne rosacea. How do I use my home IPL (or
  laser) device? As an IPL newbie, I was surprised to find that the first step
  is to remove hair from the target area – this is so that the pulsed light
  reaches the hair follicle directly rather than burning surface hairs, which
  can cause discomfort. Use your IPL on dry skin, and avoid using body lotions
  before a treatment. If you’re using IPL for the first time, start with a test
  area to check for discomfort before you do the whole body. Select your power
  level and use the “flash” button to emit a pulse of light, then move on to the
  next area and repeat. Some devices have a useful “glide” mode, where holding
  down the flash button releases pulses continuously as you move it over the
  body. An IPL device with a faster flash rate will, obviously, cover your
  chosen treatment area more quickly. Can anyone use IPL? The treatment works
  best on light skin with dark hair; very light blond or grey hair may not
  respond well, and darker skin tones may be at risk of burns. Always check the
  manufacturer’s guidelines to ensure your skin and hair type are compatible.
  IPL is also not suitable for male facial hair due to the thickness of beard
  hair. Avoid using IPL on sore or broken skin or very sensitive areas. If your
  device is designed for facial hair, follow the instructions carefully and use
  any special facial attachments included. Never use a body-only device on the
  face. Are there any drawbacks to using IPL? The main drawback is the upfront
  cost – IPL devices cost more than you’re probably used to spending on hair
  removal. However, if you tot up the cost of a monthly salon wax (or even
  at-home waxing and depilation), you’ll probably find that an IPL device costs
  the same or less after about a year or so. IPL devices are also less painful
  than waxing or epilation, cleaner than creams, and reduce ingrown hairs and
  irritation compared with shaving. How long will my IPL device last? Below each
  product in this roundup, we’ve detailed the number of flashes each device is
  expected to produce over its working lifetime, ranging from 300,000 to 600,000
  flashes. What that means in practice will depend on the size of the area you
  want to treat and how often you treat it. You can expect to use about 100-120
  flashes each time you treat a half leg (ankle to knee), with most devices
  recommending a monthly maintenance treatment after the first eight to 12 weeks
  of use. If you’re using your IPL on your arms and legs once a month, that
  means your device should last between 20 and 30 years – plenty of use for the
  price. Can I recycle my IPL device? If you want to upgrade your IPL device
  before it reaches the end of its natural life, you’ll want to make sure you
  dispose of your current device sustainably. If your IPL device still works but
  you no longer need it, check whether the manufacturer offers a refurbishment
  or resale programme; you may even be able to trade in your old model for a
  newer device. Resale programmes are also great for buying if you’re on a
  budget – manufacturer-refurbished IPLs come with the same statutory guarantees
  as new products, so they’re safe to use and often significantly cheaper. If
  your IPL device no longer works, it can still be recycled under the Waste
  Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. Some manufacturers and
  retailers accept devices for recycling at the point of sale, or you can check
  if your local recycling centre accepts WEEE items. If your local centre can’t
  take WEEE for any reason, Recycle Your Electricals should be able to help. ***

An IPL device with a faster flash rate will, obviously, cover your chosen treatment area more quickly. Can anyone use IPL? The treatment works best on light skin with dark hair; very light blond or grey hair may not respond well, and darker skin tones may be at risk of burns. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines to ensure your skin and hair type are compatible. IPL is also not suitable for male facial hair due to the thickness of beard hair. Avoid using IPL on sore or broken skin or very sensitive areas. If your device is designed for facial hair, follow the instructions carefully and use any special facial attachments included. Never use a body-only device on the face. Are there any drawbacks to using IPL? The main drawback is the upfront cost – IPL devices cost more than you’re probably used to spending on hair removal. However, if you tot up the cost of a monthly salon wax (or even at-home waxing and depilation), you’ll probably find that an IPL device costs the same or less after about a year or so. IPL devices are also less painful than waxing or epilation, cleaner than creams, and reduce ingrown hairs and irritation compared with shaving. How long will my IPL device last? Below each product in this roundup, we’ve detailed the number of flashes each device is expected to produce over its working lifetime, ranging from 300,000 to 600,000 flashes. What that means in practice will depend on the size of the area you want to treat and how often you treat it. You can expect to use about 100-120 flashes each time you treat a half leg (ankle to knee), with most devices recommending a monthly maintenance treatment after the first eight to 12 weeks of use. If you’re using your IPL on your arms and legs once a month, that means your device should last between 20 and 30 years – plenty of use for the price. Can I recycle my IPL device? If you want to upgrade your IPL device before it reaches the end of its natural life, you’ll want to make sure you dispose of your current device sustainably. If your IPL device still works but you no longer need it, check whether the manufacturer offers a refurbishment or resale programme; you may even be able to trade in your old model for a newer device. Resale programmes are also great for buying if you’re on a budget – manufacturer-refurbished IPLs come with the same statutory guarantees as new products, so they’re safe to use and often significantly cheaper. If your IPL device no longer works, it can still be recycled under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive. Some manufacturers and retailers accept devices for recycling at the point of sale, or you can check if your local recycling centre accepts WEEE items. If your local centre can’t take WEEE for any reason, Recycle Your Electricals should be able to help. *** Lise Smith is a beauty and lifestyle journalist who loves getting her hands and hair on the latest in beauty technology.
