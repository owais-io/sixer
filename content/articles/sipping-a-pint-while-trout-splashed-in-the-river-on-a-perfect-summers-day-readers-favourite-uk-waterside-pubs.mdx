  An inspiring pub with a river-based menu, Hampshire During last month’s
  heatwave I was lucky to cool off at an outside table at the Mayfly on the
  River Test near Stockbridge. Sipping a refreshing pint while leaping trout
  splashed in the water gave the scene a feel of the perfect English summer day.
  There’s a nearby weir, and forests and fields stretch into the distance. The
  pub has friendly staff, plenty of tables and a river-based menu including
  “brown butter chalk stream trout fillet” (£20.50) plus pub classics. If the
  setting inspired you as it did me, there are vineyards nearby to explore and
  the timber-framed village of Wherwell is just a stroll along the towpath. Joe
  A celebration of Hull’s maritime history The Minerva stands at the entrance to
  Hull’s trendy marina and has fantastic views over the Humber estuary. It
  opened in 1829 and is decorated with pictures, photos, maps and shields that
  celebrate Hull’s maritime history. “The snug” can only fit two people and is
  claimed to be the smallest pub room in the UK. The staff are brilliant and
  there’s an ever-changing selection of guest ales. Rob Warrington’s most serene
  pub The Ferry Tavern is a family-run pub that stands proud on its own island
  between the River Mersey and the Sankey to St Helen’s canal. Although it feels
  worlds away from nearby built-up areas, it’s easily accessible, and best
  approached on foot or by bike, sitting right on the Trans-Pennine trail. The
  beer garden stretches along the riverbank, and nursing a pint of ale on a
  summer evening while looking out across this tranquil section of the Mersey
  with all its birdlife is serenity. The 300-year-old tavern is all cosy low
  ceilings and wooden beams, perfection for the Sunday pub quiz, while Foodie
  Fridays attracts locals to themed cuisine from Mexican to Greek. The rest of
  the week, however, hot food is not served. Matt Lunt A grand pub on the Grand
  Union canal in Warwickshire The 18th-century Blue Lias is a lovely family-run
  pub on the peaceful banks of the Grand Union canal in the heart of the verdant
  Warwickshire countryside. It beckoned me towards its outside beer garden as I
  strolled along the canal with its vibrant flower baskets hanging outside and
  the welcoming sound of friendly chatter from fellow walkers sipping ale. The
  pub is named after the clay that’s quarried in the area and offers a
  beautiful, calm ambience on a summer’s day with many people arriving on foot
  or by narrowboat. Gina Oozing history in Cornwall The Pandora Inn, on the
  banks of Restronguet creek between Truro and Falmouth, is a fantastic place to
  watch the world go by. Parts of the pub date back to the 13th century and the
  flagstone floors and thatched roof ooze history. But for me, the main
  attraction is the pontoon reaching out into the creek – the perfect place to
  watch wildlife and the regular clientele arriving by smallboat and kayak.
  Plus, the cheesy chips are to die for! Matt Croxall Just wading birds for
  company, Cumbria One of the best beer gardens and all-round views in the
  country must be at the Bay Horse on the outskirts of Ulverston. The pub-hotel
  sits where the Ulverston canal meets the tidal estuary of the River Leven – an
  idyllic spot between the vast otherworldly expanses of Morecambe Bay and the
  soaring mountains of the Lake District. Being out of town, it’s often quiet
  with only wading birds and the odd train for company. Being just outside the
  national park means the prices are also more Cumbrian (cheap) than at tourist
  traps in the Lakes. Michael A step ahead in north Devon The Tarr Farm Inn in
  Exmoor is in a secluded valley right by Tarr Steps, an ancient clapper bridge
  across the River Barle. It’s a fantastic spot for a dog walk and a pint of
  local cider while the kids paddle in the stream. The inn dates from the 1600s
  and serves outstanding food (it was once chosen to provide the VIP catering
  for Glastonbury festival). Jen The herons of Cambridge know a good pub The
  Granta overlooks the Mill Pond and Sheep’s Green by the River Cam, and,
  despite being less than half a mile from the city centre, has countryside pub
  vibes. During the summer, cows may wander freely on the other side of the pond
  – old grazing rights are still utilised on Cambridge’s commons. Moorhens, mute
  swans and herons are regular neighbours, the latter often statue-like at the
  water’s edge. The pub’s terrace offers a chance to relax with a drink while
  watching over this watering hole. There’s even the chance of a cameo in cobalt
  from a passing kingfisher: an alternative Cambridge blue. Sharon Pinner
  Watering hole by south London’s River Wandle The William Morris at Merton
  Abbey Mills in Colliers Wood, south London, is a super-friendly pub next to
  the River Wandle. There is regular live music, lovely independent shops, and
  children can watch a watermill and learn about water energy. Although there is
  lots of traffic not too far way, the actual pub, named after the 19th-century
  textile designer, is a fab watering hole where you can almost forget about
  London. A short walk away is the National Trust’s Morden Hall Park – you could
  whet your appetite by going there first. Asa Winning tip: Aire of excitement
  in Leeds Piglove by the River sits in the Leeds’ Climate Innovation District
  on the River Aire. It’s not just the name that enchants. Owned by two
  Venezuelans who say they are inspired by the UK’s craft beer tradition,
  Piglove offers small-batch beers brewed on site, rotating weekend street-food
  trucks, and a programme of tone-perfect events: quiz nights, spoken word,
  post-run cool-downs, pride marches, and jazz if you time it right. There’s a
  greengrocers, mismatched benches, and the sense that something slightly
  bonkers might happen at any moment. It’s walkable from the city centre,
  waiting for you to be seduced by the hum of Friday-night gatherings or the
  scent of pizza wafting over the sunlit water. Eliza Ainley
