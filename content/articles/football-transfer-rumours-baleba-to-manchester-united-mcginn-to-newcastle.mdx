  With Benjamin Sesko very close to joining Manchester United, the recruitment
  bods need something else to do. They have passed the time by trying to find
  out just how much it would cost to sign Carlos Baleba from Brighton. Ruben
  Amorim needs an extra central midfielder who can actually run around a bit and
  the Cameroonian would be ideal but the Seagulls are not keen on selling.
  Across Manchester, it’s about trying to get rid of a few as Pep Guardiola
  wants to trim his squad. Jack Grealish does not look like he will get much in
  the way of minutes at City this season and will seek opportunities elsewhere.
  Everton have made contact with City as the seek a season-long loan but are a
  bit worried about how much the winger is actually on because they will not be
  able to pay the full lot. One person not heading out the Etihad Stadium exit
  door is Mateo Kovacic. Saudi Premier League clubs have expressed interest in
  the Croatia midfielder but it is just not the move for the 31-year-old who
  would rather stay in the Premier League. Having missed out on every man and
  his dog this summer, Newcastle have their eyes firmly fixed on the next person
  to turn them down. He goes by the name John McGinn and he currently plays for
  Aston Villa. Everton previously made enquiries about the Scotland midfielder
  but nothing was doing. Nottingham Forest are the latest club to find that
  Ipswich are not particularly eager to let Omari Hutchinson go. Brentford tried
  to steal him away earlier in the summer and now Evangelos Marinakis has
  offered a massive wad adding up to £35m, only to be told that is not enough
  and been sent on his way. A more likely move involving Forest and a winger
  could see Jota Silva leave the club and return to Portugal with Sporting. The
  Tricky Trees want double the £5.9m they paid for him 12 months ago. The world
  may need to get used to two Idrissa Gueyes in the Premier League because West
  Ham are stepping up their interest in the Metz teenage prodigy who shares a
  name with the Everton man. The French club want £13m for the forward, who has
  also attracted interest from Manchester United and Brentford. José Mourinho is
  eyeing a £13m for the Tottenham midfielder Yves Bissouma, who is tempted by a
  move to Fenerbahce. West Ham and Juventus could, however, provide competition
  for his signature. One midfielder wanting to leave Turkey is Alex
  Oxlade-Chamberlain. The midfielder looks set to be released by Besiktas soon
  enough and that has alerted English clubs to his availability. Leeds might
  fancy securing the services of the former England International for absolutely
  nothing.
