  David Lammy has received a formal warning after reporting himself for fishing
  without a licence with the US vice-president, JD Vance. The foreign secretary
  took Vance angling at his official country retreat in Chevening, Kent, on 8
  August as he hosted him at the start of a holiday in Britain. It later emerged
  Lammy did not possess the required licence for rod fishing, with a Foreign
  Office spokesperson blaming an “administrative oversight” and saying the
  minister had subsequently bought a licence. Lammy referred himself to the
  Environment Agency over the incident. Anglers in England and Wales aged 13 or
  over must have a rod licence to fish for freshwater species such as carp, and
  can face a fine of up to £2,500 if they do not. On Friday, an Environment
  Agency spokesperson said Lammy would not be prosecuted but had received a
  formal warning, adding: “Everyone who goes fishing needs a licence to help
  improve our rivers, lakes and the sport anglers love. “As Mr Lammy has
  confirmed, we have issued a warning letter for fishing without a licence in
  line with our enforcement and sanctions policy.” The agency’s first response
  to a breach is usually to issue advice or a warning rather than launch a
  prosecution, particularly in cases involving inexperienced anglers with no
  history of fishing without a licence. The Labour MP for Tottenham did not
  catch anything during his fishing trip, while the US vice-president said he
  and his children had landed fish that were subsequently returned to the lake.
  A Foreign Office spokesperson said: “The findings of the Environment Agency
  draw a line under this matter. “As soon as it became apparent there had been
  an administrative oversight, the foreign secretary wrote to the agency so it
  could consider appropriate action and to thank them for their work protecting
  Britain’s fisheries. “He also bought the relevant rod licences to ensure there
  was no repeat of the situation in the future.”
