  Super Charlie review – superhero baby yarn channels resentment of older kids
  at new arrivals
sectionName: Film

  Super mediocre is more like it. Or super underwhelming. This family animation
  about a baby with superhero powers is adapted from a children’s book series by
  the bestselling Swedish crime novelist Camilla Läckberg, but with almost no
  feel for its target audience. It’s pitched at very young kids (if you ignore
  the dodgy gag about a new mum breastfeeding her baby’s father). But Super
  Charlie is seriously lacking a sense of fun or a silly streak to tickle little
  funny bones – it’s as if the film-makers have never met anyone under five.
  Willie (voiced by Alex Kelly in the English-language version) is a 10-year-old
  in a deep pit of disgruntlement following the birth of his baby brother,
  Charlie. “How long will he be this useless?!” His exhausted parents are too
  busy for him so when Willie discovers that Charlie has got super powers, he
  decides to claim the glory for himself (making an “S” for sidekick T-shirt for
  little Charlie). There’s an elaborate backstory to explain the villains,
  another pair of siblings with a plot to take control of the police force using
  robo-police suits. There is a serious theme here about the hurt and resentment
  a child can feel at being usurped by the arrival of a new baby. But Super
  Charlie doesn’t have anywhere near the heart of a Pixar; it simply chugs
  along, bland and a bit unimaginative. It doesn’t have nearly enough fun with
  its pint-sized superhero either. The Boss Baby got plenty of mileage out of a
  baby carrying a briefcase, and little Jack-Jack in The Incredibles was cute as
  well as mighty. Poor Super Charlie is destined to be no one’s favourite child.
  • Super Charlie is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August.
