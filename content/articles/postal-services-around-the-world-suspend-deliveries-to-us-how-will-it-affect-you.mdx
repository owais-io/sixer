  Postal services around the world have stopped sending some mail to the United
  States as they ready for expanded tariffs, after Donald Trump removed an
  exemption on packages worth under US$800. Carriers have been temporarily
  suspending services since Friday to avoid delivering packages after 29 August,
  when they will start to be charged full tariff rates for most parcels. Here’s
  what you need to know about what has changed and which countries have been
  affected. Why are postal services being suspended? The cost of mailing
  packages to the US is set to surge after the Trump administration removed a
  rule exempting packages worth under US$800 from tariffs. From Friday, packages
  will be subject to fees relating to the tariff rates applying to their country
  of origin, making postage much more expensive. Postal services will have to
  cover the increased cost or pass it on to customers. Dozens of countries have
  suspended postal services to the US to take time to adjust to the new rules
  and account for increased expenses. Trump’s tariff moves had not previously
  impacted the mailing of packages valued at less than US$800, which were
  exempted under “de minimis” rules, a Latin term referring to items too minor
  to worry about. Trump in July announced he would remove de minimis treatment.
  Does it apply to all mail? Service suspensions differ by country. Many postal
  services will continue to mail letters to the US but have suspended postage of
  any package of goods worth under $800. Letters and personal gifts under US$100
  will still technically be exempt from tariffs after Friday but some services
  have suspended all US postage of goods and others have suspended postage to
  the US entirely. Packages that had already been shipped to the US and arrive
  before Friday will not attract tariffs. Those that arrive after Friday may be
  returned to sender to avoid incurring fees, Belgium’s bpost said, while New
  Zealand’s service said it would hold the receiver responsible for all duties
  and taxes. Which countries have stopped delivering mail to the US?
  International postal services in nearly 30 countries had suspended some
  services to the US by Tuesday. Services in 22 European countries – including
  the UK, France, Germany and Italy – have suspended some deliveries since
  Friday. PostEurop said its members, including a further 32 postal services,
  could be forced to restrict shipping. In Asia and the Pacific, services in
  Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore have
  suspended some or all deliveries. Online marketplace Etsy has suspended US
  shipping label services for Australia Post, Canada Post and the UK’s Royal
  Mail and Evri, encouraging users to find alternative carriers who let them
  pre-pay tariff fees. When will mail to the US return? Postal services have
  told customers US deliveries will be suspended indefinitely until they have
  developed alternative systems. Belgium’s bpost said the interruption would
  last until the US government had provided complete detail on the new import
  rules and it could adapt its systems to match. Australia Post warned customers
  postage fees would increase to account for the tariff fees and new handling
  fees, after it partnered with a US customs-authorised payments operator to
  develop its new billing system. While services are yet to determine how their
  fees might change, parcels will face the tariff rate imposed on their country
  of origin. Until late February, US customs will also accept a temporary
  alternative fixed fee, differing by the tariff rate of the country of origin:
  $80, $160 or $200 per item, respectively, for countries with tariffs of under
  16%, 16% to 25% and over 25%. Why did Trump remove de minimis treatment? The
  change is the latest effect of the Trump administration’s reforms to US trade
  policy and use of tariffs as a diplomatic weapon. De minimis exemptions
  facilitated significant duty-free trade around the world, allowing businesses
  to sell goods at relatively lower prices if shipped in smaller bundles. The US
  received a total of 1.36bn packages in 2024 under the exemption, containing
  goods worth $64.6bn, according to US Customs. Online retailers including
  Amazon, Etsy, Shein and Temu have benefited from the rule. All countries
  facing tariffs will now be affected by the removal of the de minimis
  exemption. Trump had already suspended the exemption for packages from China
  and Hong Kong in May, which the White House said accounted for the majority of
  de minimis shipments to the US. Industry associations in the US had wanted the
  loophole closed for years, complaining of unfair competition from Chinese
  sellers. The move nearly halved the number of US users of China-based Temu in
  May compared with March, Reuters reported. After Trump signed the executive
  order in July suspending de minimis treatment, the White House released a
  statement claiming the exemption had been abused to export fentanyl and
  opioids to the US, “killing Americans”.
