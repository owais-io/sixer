  police shooting and suspect Dezi Freeman

  A manhunt is under way for Dezi Freeman, a 56-year-old so-called “sovereign
  citizen” accused of killing two police officers and injuring another in the
  Victorian town of Porepunkah, which is home to about 1,000 people. Here’s what
  we know so far: About 10.30am on Tuesday, 10 police were attending a rural
  property in Porepunkah to execute a search warrant when they were fired upon.
  Two officers were killed and another was wounded. The officers killed were
  detective leading senior constable Neal Thompson, 59, and senior constable
  Vadim De Waart, 35. Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined
  Victoria police in 1987 and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood
  police station before working as a detective at the major fraud squad and the
  state crime squad. De Waart had only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the
  shooting occurred. He started his policing career at the Victoria police
  academy in late 2018 and worked for three years at St Kilda police station
  before joining the public order response team as a senior constable in April
  2023. The police officer who was wounded has had surgery. On Thursday morning
  he remained in a stable condition at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne, a
  hospital spokesperson confirmed. According to the chief commissioner of
  Victoria police, Mike Bush, the officers were “met by the offender, and they
  were murdered in cold blood”. On Wednesday, Bush named the suspect as
  56-year-old Dezi Freeman, or Desmond Filby, whom he described as “heavily
  armed” and said he “understands bushcraft well”. He said Freeman had been able
  to run into the bush near the property alone immediately after the shooting.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email Bush said it was believed Freeman was armed
  with multiple firearms, including long arms. He said police were still
  examining the scene to understand whether he took any additional weapons from
  police. The area around the town, about 300km north-east of Melbourne, is
  steep and mountainous. On Wednesday afternoon police released a new image of
  Freeman and a description of him as Caucasian, 183cm tall, with medium build,
  short dark hair and brown eyes. Police said he was last seen wearing “dark
  green (khaki) tracksuit pants, dark green rain jacket, brown Blundstone boots
  and reading glasses”. Freeman has a history of association with pseudolaw and
  “sovereign citizen” ideas. Bush would not confirm this but said he was known
  to police before the shooting. How has the search for Dezi Freeman unfolded?
  Police have deployed hundreds of specialist resources, including air and
  ground, to find him. On Tuesday Bush described the suspect’s address as a
  semi-rural property with a bus on site, which housed the alleged offender, his
  partner and children. Bush described the search area as “very wide”, with
  Freeman likely to “know that area better than us”. He said there had been no
  sightings of him since he fled into the bush on Tuesday. The Police
  Association Victoria chief executive, Wayne Gatt, said “hundreds of our
  members” were continuing to “put themselves in danger right as we speak” in an
  attempt to apprehend the suspect. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, said
  Wednesday evening there were “huge resources” being put on the ground in North
  East Victoria. New South Wales police have also offered support. On Thursday
  afternoon, the Australian federal police confirmed it was providing assistance
  to the Porepunkah operation at the request of Victoria police. Guardian
  Australia understands that officers from the tactical response team have been
  deployed. The state’s police minister, Anthony Carbines, on Thursday said Bush
  had not requested additional financial support, while interstate police had
  provided technical and specialised assistance. He said the force was throwing
  “everything” at the search and the government had pledged “anything” it needs.
  Deputy commissioner regional operations, Russell Barrett, on Thursday said
  “every available asset” was being put into the manhunt. “We will not rest
  until we apprehend the offender,” he said. Barrett described the search as
  “protracted” owing to the “difficult terrain” police were navigating. Victoria
  police on Thursday said “severe weather” had complicated travel in the region.
  The Bureau of Meteorology forecast that a cold weather system could dump large
  amounts of snow – up to half a metre – over the Alpine mountains near the
  Victoria-NSW border. Bush said the team who went to Freeman’s property was
  made up of local officers and members of the sexual offences and child abuse
  team: “It’s a large area, so it required a large number of staff to search the
  area and also search for technology.” It was not a “hostage situation”, Bush
  said, as Freeman’s partner and children had attended a police station on
  Tuesday evening. He said police had spoken with Freeman’s partner. On
  Thursday, superintendent Brett Kahan addressed Freeman directly during a press
  conference, saying: “If Dezi Freeman is watching this, ring triple zero, and
  we will support a surrender plan.” How has the Porepunkah community been
  affected? Kahan said on Thursday the Porepunkah community did not need to stay
  indoors but should remain vigilant. Police searches have been carried out on
  local properties, police said on Thursday. Barrett warned that anyone
  harbouring Freeman was committing a criminal offence. The local council closed
  all facilities “effective immediately”, and Porepunkah primary school was in
  lockdown for a period on Tuesday. The school reopened on Thursday morning. On
  Thursday, police advised members of the public, particularly those heading to
  nearby ski resorts, to avoid Porepunkah. What has the wider reaction been?
  Allan said the thoughts of “all Victorians” were with the police, saying the
  response showed first responders’ “extraordinary bravery and courage”. The
  prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said his thoughts were with the “police for
  the work they do, each and every day”. He said “the men and women who wear the
  uniform of the police take risks” for everyone. In parliament on Thursday, the
  PM was joined by the leader of the opposition, Sussan Ley, and the member for
  Indi, Helen Haines, in paying tribute to the victims before a moment’s silence
  in their honour. The mayor of Alpine shire, Sarah Nicholas, said in a video
  message that Tuesday had been a day of “deep sorrow and shock” for the
  community: “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and
  colleagues of the two police officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our
  thoughts, love and unwavering support are with you during this incredibly
  painful time.” The Victorian government has offered support to the local
  council and the Porepunkah primary school, including trauma counselling for
  any students, staff and affected families. • In Australia, support is
