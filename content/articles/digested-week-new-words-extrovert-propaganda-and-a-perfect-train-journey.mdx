  Monday My goodness, is it time for the Cambridge Dictionary’s annual release
  of the new words that have made it into its hallowed listings already! It
  seems to come round quicker every year. Possibly that should be “more
  quickly”. Their grammarian splinter group will let me know. Far more so than
  birthdays or adventures in HRT, this event is a great measure of how
  functionally old you are. How much of the world do you, quite literally, still
  understand? I have heard of, and indeed enjoy though have never personally
  deployed, “delulu” – a play on “delusional”. “Tradwife”, too – which is the
  practice of monetising all the most boring bits of motherhood and domesticity
  on Instagram, under the guise of upholding conservative tradition. I like to
  think that among tradwives themselves it also carries the meaning of “socking
  all the proceeds away in a secret bank account and taking off for Costa Rica
  the minute the last child turns 18”, but I have yet to confirm. Then things
  get harder. “Mouse jiggler” is more innocuous than I first feared and just
  about inferable (software that makes it look like you are still working if you
  are not in the office but likely to be remotely observed) but “skibidi”
  defeated me. It’s a YouTuber’s coinage, and seems to mean everything and
  nothing. Only those born to the skibidi can use it properly. And that is as it
  should be. The words “bath chair”, “tartan rug” and “Werther’s Originals”
  remain for the rest of us. Tuesday Spare a thought for the poor Prince and
  Princess of Wales, soon to be up to their eyes in packing tape and cardboard
  boxes as they prepare to move from Adelaide Cottage on the Windsor Great Park
  estate to Forest Lodge on … the Windsor Great Park estate. Nothing says “I
  live a life unimaginably distant from yours” than a) the ability to move house
  at whim and b) to one that’s essentially in the same garden. Yes, there’s an
  extra four bedrooms in it for them (otherwise it’d just be another cottage,
  not a lodge, duh!), but imagine a normal doing the equivalent and going to all
  the expense and stress to move a few doors up the road. Although take away the
  stamp duty, the unreliable movers, the crippling solicitor’s fees, the dealing
  with utility companies and estate agents – oh, and the sale price, which I
  didn’t so much forget as find myself unable to conceive of living a life
  without – and the whole thing becomes instantly feasible. Who knew? Who knew?
  Wednesday Another new word is upon us! What a week we’re having! This time it
  is “otrovert”. I thought at first it might be something to do with
  non-innocuous mouse-jiggling, but no. It is a term coined by the American
  psychiatrist Rami Kaminski for people “whose fundamental orientation is
  defined by the fact that it is rarely the same direction that anyone else is
  facing”. (He’s written a book about them.) Oh, for heaven’s sake. That’s
  mostly just your common-or-garden introvert in a world that’s largely
  extrovert and they’re just facing into a book – leave them alone. The
  remainder are simple contrarians, the most wearisome people in the world. They
  see a received opinion and immediately set themselves mindlessly up against
  it. Thursday Speaking of Jungian archetypes as we tangentially were,
  researchers are claiming that almost every activity is more enjoyable in
  company – even reading. Which is just more blatant propaganda from Big
  Extrovert bent on destroying the last havens of peace for those who don’t
  follow their busy, cacophonous lead. We have to start pushing back at this
  point. We can attack the new contention on any number of grounds. On the
  practical: is farting better in company? It’s funnier, sure, at least for the
  farter – but beyond that? And even for the detonator, the law of diminishing
  returns sets in pretty quickly. On the philosophical: can masturbation, for
  example, truly be said to be taking place in company? Does it not become
  subsumed within exhibitionism? And on the methodological: this study was
  carried out using only American subjects, citizens of the most extrovert,
  camera-ready nation on earth. To take them as representative samples of
  humanity is a very great mistake. Friday Common sense and a small
  understanding of probability theory tells us it is technically possible – but
  still. No one really thinks they will live to experience it but on the way
  back from Edinburgh, where I’d been talking about my new book (Bookish –
  available in all good bookshops and maybe some bad ones too, if there is such
  a thing), I did. I had a perfect train journey. No, honestly. I’ve no reason
  to lie. I thought all my travel luck had been used up when the 11.05 arrived
  on time. But then I got on and reservation screens were working and my seat
  had not been taken. The lady next to me was a reader and knitter. We smiled at
  each other as I sat down, and that was the full extent of our interaction over
  the next three and a half hours. During which: nobody yelled into a phone; the
  few children there played quietly together at their tables; the air
  conditioning worked and kept us at a comfortable instead of sub-arctic
  temperature. And the buffet was open. This really happened. I feel I am going
  to pay for it somehow in the next few days – I am constantly checking the cats
  for signs of illness and my bank account for fraud – but until then, I shall
  revere the memory.
