  The manufacturer of the weight loss drug Mounjaro has paused shipments to the
  UK before a significant price rise for the treatment next month. The US
  pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly is due to increase the UK list price of the
  drug by up to 170% from September, amid a White House push to get drugmakers
  to raise medicine prices in Europe to allow for price cuts in the US. The
  company said that in order to manage its supply and ensure that patients
  maintained access, it had allocations in place for pharmacies and providers
  that ordered medicines from the company. There were legal protections to
  prevent inappropriate stockpiling of medicines by providers, Eli Lilly said.
  It plans to resume orders on 1 September. The rise in prices could result in a
  month’s supply of the highest dose of the medicine increasing from £122 to
  £330 ($165 to $445). Eli Lilly has reportedly told its two British wholesalers
  to temporarily stop taking orders after demand soared before the price
  increase comes into force on 1 September. Pharmacies said there had been panic
  buying of the drug since the price announcement this month. People using
  Mounjaro have been warned against switching to sellers on the hidden economy
  or bulk buying. While many pay for the drug in the UK, it became available on
  the NHS at the end of June, and Eli Lilly says the higher price will not
  affect those who get it through the health service. Mounjaro – also known by
  its generic name tirzepatide – has become a popular alternative to the most
  well-known weight loss drug, Ozempic. Both drugs, which are taken as weekly
  injections, were developed as treatments for type 2 diabetes. When it was
  launched in Britain in February 2024, Eli Lilly agreed to a list price
  “significantly below” its other European markets to stop delays in
  availability of the medicine through the NHS. The increase in the list price
  will align it more consistently, the company has said, although it added that
  the NHS would not pay the new, higher price to ensure continued access for
  people with obesity and type 2 diabetes receiving it through the health
  service. On 31 July, Donald Trump sent letters to 17 of the world’s biggest
  drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, demanding cuts to prices for
  Americans within 60 days. In May, the US president told reporters that a
  friend in London had told him he had bought the “fat-shot drug” for $88,
  compared with $1,300 in New York.
