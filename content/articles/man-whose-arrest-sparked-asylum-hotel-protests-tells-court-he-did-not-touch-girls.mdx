  An Ethiopian man who became the focus of far-right demonstrations outside a
  hotel in Epping after being accused of sexually assaulting two teenagers has
  told a court he did not touch the girls. “I’m not a wild animal. I can’t do
  these kind of things,” Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker housed at
  the Bell hotel in Epping, told his trial at Colchester magistrates court on
  Wednesday. Speaking through an interpreter, he added: “This is anti-Christian
  – these are just children, innocent children.” Kebatu, who told the court he
  was a sports teacher in Ethiopia, denies three counts of sexual assault
  against two 14-year-old girls and a woman in Epping town centre on 7 and 8
  July this year. He also denies one count of inciting a girl to engage in
  sexual activity and one count of harassment without violence. He told the
  court he only said “hello” to the schoolgirl and her friends in Epping town
  centre and nothing more because he was “worried” about his asylum case.
  Earlier on Wednesday, Kebatu’s adult accuser told the court via video link
  that she was shocked and angry after being touched on the thigh by Kebatu and
  witnessing him touch one of the girls on 8 July. Kebatu claimed she was drunk
  and had threatened to call the police if he failed to come to her house, the
  court heard. Questioned about why he could be seen in CCTV footage on his
  knees saying sorry to the woman, the defendant said: “At that time she was
  drunk, she was very agitated and I just wanted to calm her.” He added: “I was
  going to the Bell hotel at that time and I was worried about the ramifications
  on the other immigrants.” The woman, who exercised her right to remain
  anonymous, said she was “shocked” and “uncomfortable” after Kebatu touched her
  when she had offered to help him with his CV. She said she also saw him
  touching one of the girls. Molly Dyas, defending Kebatu, asked the woman if
  she had made up the allegations because she was angry that Kebatu was an
  asylum seeker. The woman replied: “I didn’t make up any allegation. I know
  exactly what I saw. I’ve no issue with asylum seekers … I was angry that he
  had touched a 14-year-old girl.” She said the defendant was “begging, pleading
  and apologising” when she confronted him about an alleged sexual assault on
  the girl. Cross-examining Kebatu, the prosecutor Stuart Cowen said: “You are a
  sexual predator who tried to assault one girl and one woman in exactly the
  same way. That is the truth, isn’t it?” Kebatu responded: “I am not such a
  person. I can’t do these kind of things.” The defendant said he had been
  living in the hotel for about a week before his arrest, after travelling
  through Sudan, Libya, Italy and France in order to get to the UK. He told the
  court he paid about €1,800 (£1,550) to board a small boat and cross the
  Channel. Cowen acknowledged that Kebatu’s case had “attracted quite a lot of
  publicity because of the defendant’s personal circumstances”. Kebatu’s arrest
  last month sparked weeks of violent demonstrations outside the Bell hotel.
  Epping Forest council has since won a court injunction to stop the hotel being
  used to house asylum seekers. The district judge Christopher Williams
  adjourned the trial until 4 September.
