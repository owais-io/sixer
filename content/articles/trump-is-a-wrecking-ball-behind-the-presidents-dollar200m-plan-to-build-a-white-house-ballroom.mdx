  “Sir, why are you up on the roof?” The question was shouted by a reporter on
  Tuesday as Donald Trump scaled new heights at the White House. The US
  president explained that he was scoping out a new ballroom and boasted: “Just
  another way to spend my money for this country.” It emerged last week that
  Trump, who made his money in the New York construction industry, intends to
  build an enormous $200m ballroom for hosting official receptions, one of the
  biggest projects at the White House in more than a century. This will be just
  the latest step in a radical architectural overhaul intent on making the
  225-year-old executive mansion less redolent of stuffy Washington and more
  evocative of Mar-a-Lago, his gaudy palace in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump has
  revamped the Oval Office by splashing the room in gold, from the stars
  surrounding the presidential seal on the ceiling to gold statues on the
  fireplace to the mantel itself. He crowded its walls with numerous portraits,
  while just outside the office is a framed photo of Trump’s mugshot as featured
  on the cover of a New York tabloid newspaper. Outside, Trump has erected a
  pair of towering flagpoles that fly the Stars and Stripes and paved over a
  grassy patch of the Rose Garden, and, he told NBC News, he intends to replace
  what he said was a “terribly” remodeled bathroom in the Lincoln Bedroom with
  one that is closer in style to the 19th century. But his most ambitious
  architectural gambit will be the new ballroom, which officials say he and
  unspecified donors will pay for, designed to host grand state dinners, given
  in honour of foreign leaders visiting Washington. Until now, these were
  generally done by erecting a huge tent on the White House grounds. “When it
  rains or snows, it’s a disaster,” Trump said in his NBC interview, bemoaning
  how the tents are stationed “a football field away from the White House”.
  Whereas the East Room, currently the biggest room in the White House, can
  accommodate about 200 people, the new structure will span more than 8,000 sq
  metres (90,000 sq ft) and have space to seat 650 people. Work will begin in
  September and is expected to be completed before the end of Trump’s second
  term, in January 2029. A model of the ballroom presented by the government
  shows it will be a white building with tall windows reminiscent of the main
  White House edifice. It will replace the East Wing, which usually houses the
  offices of the first lady, and it remains unclear where they will be
  relocated. Trump told reporters last week: “They’ve wanted a ballroom at the
  White House for more than 150 years, but there’s never been a president that
  was good at ballrooms. I’m good at building things and we’re going to build
  quickly and on time. It’ll be beautiful, top, top of the line.” He added:
  “It’ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing
  building, which I’m the biggest fan of. It’s my favourite. It’s my favourite
  place. I love it.” Democrats are sceptical, however. Chuck Schumer, the
  party’s minority leader in the Senate, told a press briefing: “Listen, I’m
  happy to eat my cheeseburger at my desk. I don’t need a $200m ballroom to eat
  it in. OK?” Others regard Trump’s transformation of the White House as a dark
  metaphor for his approach to US democracy. Mona Charen, policy editor of the
  Bulwark website, wrote this week: “Trump is a walking wrecking ball of law,
  tradition, civility, manners, and morals. Many visitors to the nation’s
  capital won’t know or understand much of that damage. “But starting now with
  the paving of the Rose Garden, and coming soon with the construction of a
  garish ballroom, they will see a physical representation of a low and shameful
  time. The once graceful executive mansion will be transformed into something
  tasteless and embarrassing. It will be both awful and fitting.” The ballroom
  is shaping up to be one of the most significant projects to break ground at
  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue since renovation and expansion works undertaken by
  Theodore Roosevelt at the start of the 20th century. Harry Truman also oversaw
  sweeping construction work between 1948 and 1952, including gutting the main
  building and adding the Truman Balcony. Truman drew his share of criticism at
  the time. Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical
  Association, wrote in a recent essay published on LinkedIn: “Preservationists
  mourned the loss of original interiors, while media outlets questioned the
  project’s cost during post-war economic recovery.” Subsequent presidents have
  overseen facelifts, refreshes and renovations. Anita McBride, who was chief of
  staff to first lady Laura Bush, recalled on Wednesday: “Mrs Bush transformed
  every single room in the residence. The largest restoration of any room in the
  White House is the Lincoln Bedroom, done under her tenure. She helped to
  oversee the the redo of the White House theatre; the way that she designed it
  is the way it still looks to this day.” McBride acknowledged that Trump, a
  longtime property developer, is more engaged in remodelling the White House
  than many of his predecessors. “He’s certainly paying attention to things at
  the White House that he feels would be improvements for the occupants, not
  just him but those that come after him. Maybe it’s his background that lends
  itself to having a keen eye to enhancements. “This is the largest
  transformation we have seen since the Truman renovation when it needed
  improvement and to be structurally sound. President Truman took such criticism
  for wanting to add the balcony and you cannot imagine the White House without
  that balcony now.”
