  Javad Zarif, the former Iranian foreign minister, is proposing a new
  UN-endorsed forum for civil nuclear cooperation across the Middle East and
  north Africa, dedicated to sharing enriched uranium and the fruits of civil
  nuclear power, as part of a drive to end the threat of nuclear weapons in the
  region. The proposal is made in a Guardian article written jointly by Zarif,
  until recently a close adviser to the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian,
  and Mohsen Baharvand, a former Iranian ambassador to the UK. It represents the
  most positive if long-term Iranian proposal to resolve the impasse over the
  west’s concerns that Iran’s nuclear programme aims to create nuclear weapons,
  a charge Zarif denies. The US and Israel conducted a 12-day bombing campaign
  in June in an attempt to destroy Iran’s nuclear sites, and since then Iran has
  refused to resume negotiations with the US, but it has held talks with
  Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries (E3) that were party
  to the original nuclear agreement signed in 2015 and which expires in October.
  The European countries have said they will start a process next month to
  reimpose sweeping UN sanctions on Iran unless it agrees to allow UN inspectors
  from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) back into Iran. Zarif in
  his proposal says the Middle East is one of the few regions of the globe
  without a nuclear weapons-free agreement. He proposes a new “Middle East
  Network for Atomic Research and Advancement” (Menara) open to countries that
  “reject the development or deployment of nuclear weapons and commit to mutual
  verification of their compliance”. In return, Menara would help participant
  countries “benefit from peaceful nuclear technology including energy
  production, medicine, agriculture and scientific research”. Iran’s critics
  will accuse Zarif of seeking to divert attention from Tehran’s alleged covert
  plan to develop nuclear weapons, or of trying to throw the spotlight on
  Israel’s undeclared nuclear programme. Others will claim his proposal is a
  ploy in advance of continued talks between the E3 and Iran in which fresh
  pressure will be placed on Iran urgently to readmit IAEA inspectors. But his
  proposal does provide a new long-term context in which countries’ civilian
  nuclear programmes in the regions could be developed, inspected and
  controlled. It could also provide a new more acceptable international context
  in which Iran could pursue its determination to enrich uranium. Iran’s demand
  that it still be entitled to enrich uranium domestically has been a red line
  in negotiations with the US. Zarif claims the proposal would help reframe the
  debate in the region about nuclear power. “For too long, nuclear issues have
  been cast solely in terms of risk and threat. But nuclear science also offers
  solutions – to climate change, water scarcity, food security, and energy
  diversification,” he writes. “As oil and gas reserves dwindle, nuclear energy
  will be vital for regional growth and sustainability. Menara can make this
  future a shared, secure reality.”
