  High winds could pose a danger to life across parts of the UK on Monday, the
  Met Office has warned, as it upgraded the threat rating of Storm Floris from
  yellow to amber for Scotland. The storm, which was officially named on Friday,
  is expected to hit Britain early on Monday morning. The Met Office issued
  warnings of potential “injuries and danger to life” as a result of “large
  waves and beach material being thrown on to sea fronts, coastal roads and
  properties” and “flying debris”. The amber warning has been issued from 10am
  until 10pm on Monday, with yellow warnings still in effect in Northern Ireland
  and across northern England between 6am and midnight the same day. Severe
  travel delays are also expected throughout the UK owing to potential debris
  caused by the storm. The Met Office warned there would be a “spell of
  unusually strong west or north-westerly winds to much of Scotland”, with the
  chief operational meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, stating that “many inland
  areas are likely to see gusts of 40-50mph, with 60-70mph more likely at higher
  elevations and around exposed coasts in Scotland”. Lehnert also warned there
  was “a small chance that some locations here could even record gusts of
  85mph”, with such winds strong enough to break windows, damage roofs and
  uproot trees. On top of the strong winds, heavy rain is expected to come from
  the west, hitting Ireland before reaching Great Britain and covering most of
  Scotland, north Wales and northern England, as some areas such as the
  Highlands and Lake District are expected to receive heavy showers of between
  16 and 32mm of rainfall in the space of an hour. Severe travel delays are
  expected, with rail travel particularly affected by storms owing to the
  dangers that debris on the tracks can cause. Trains and ferries have already
  been cancelled, with Network Rail to close a number of routes at noon on
  Monday. All other routes will see a reduced timetable and longer journey times
  due to speed restrictions. National Rail has warned commuters to be aware it
  is “likely that speed restrictions will be in place and your journey may take
  longer”. Other modes of transport are also expected to be affected. Ferries
  operating on the west coast of Britain, such as those going between the
  Scottish mainland and the Western Isles, are cancelling services, with the
  Scottish ferry operator CalMac confirming a series of cancellations. Road
  travel will also be affected, with motorists told to take extra care during
  the storm. In a statement, the AA encouraged anyone who insisted on travelling
  on Monday to do so with care, including allowing extra time for their journey,
  being careful of other cars and looking out for branches and debris on the
  roads. The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo said on Sunday it had cancelled its
  Monday show due to the storm. Other shows in Edinburgh are also expected to be
  called off. Storm Floris is the sixth named storm to hit Britain during the
  2024-25 naming season, which runs from early September to late August, and the
  first since January’s Storm Éowyn, which caused three casualties and more than
  1 million power outages across Britain, Ireland and Norway.
