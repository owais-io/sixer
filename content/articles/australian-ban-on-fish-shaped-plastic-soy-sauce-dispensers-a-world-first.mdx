  They have been a familiar sight at takeaway sushi shops around the world for
  decades but it could be the beginning of the end for fish-shaped soy sauce
  dispensers. South Australia will be the first place in the world to ban them
  under a wider ban on single-use plastics that comes into force on 1 September.
  The device known as shoyu-tai (or soy-sauce snapper in Japanese) was invented
  in 1954 by Teruo Watanabe, the founder of Osaka-based company Asahi Sogyo,
  according to a report from Japan’s Radio Kansai. It was then common for glass
  and ceramic containers to be used but the advent of cheap industrial plastics
  allowed the creation of a small polyethylene container in the shape of a fish,
  officially named the “Lunch Charm”. The invention quickly spread around Japan
  and eventually worldwide, and it is estimated that billions have been
  produced. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Under South Australia’s new law,
  only pre-filled soy sauce containers with a lid, cap or stopper and containing
  less than 30ml of soy sauce will be banned. Plastic sachets will be allowed
  but the government hopes bulk bottles or dispensers will be used in sushi
  shops instead. The South Australian environment minister, Dr Susan Close, said
  each plastic fish container was used for just seconds but “their small size
  means they’re easily dropped, blown away, or washed into drains, making them a
  frequent component of beach and street litter”. “They’re a ‘convenience
  packaging’ item that can be replaced with bulk or refillable condiment
  solutions or more manageable alternatives, meaning their elimination directly
  reduces the volume of single-use plastic entering the waste stream,” Close
  said. Other single-use plastic items included in the ban are plastic cutlery
  and expanded polystyrene food packaging, such as pre-packed instant bowl
  noodles. Dr Nina Wootton, a marine ecologist at the University of Adelaide,
  said plastic sushi fish are more damaging because they could be mistaken for
  food by marine life. “If it hasn’t already been broken down into microplastics
  yet and it’s floating around in its whole form, then other organisms that eat
  fish that size could think it is a fish and then eat it,” Wootton said. “Since
  they are quite a thick plastic, it does take quite a while for them to
  degrade.” Cip Hamilton, a campaign manager at the Australian Marine
  Conservation Society , said banning single-use plastics was a good start but
  more needed to be done. “Bans like these are an important small step towards
  reducing plastic pollution but it’s important that governments start to look
  at reducing and removing problematic plastics across the whole system,”
  Hamilton said. “What our oceans really need is for state and federal
  governments to introduce strong laws that reduce plastic production and
  consumption and hold businesses accountable for the products they place on
  shelves, otherwise Australia’s marine life and coastlines will continue to
  suffer under mountains of plastic pollution”.
