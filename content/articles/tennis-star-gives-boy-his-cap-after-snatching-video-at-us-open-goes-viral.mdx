  Polish tennis player Kamil Majchrzak has met the young boy who appeared to
  have a cap snatched away from him by a man in the crowd at the end of a US
  Open match in New York. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Majchrzak appealed to
  his social media followers to help find the boy after footage of him
  attempting to give his cap to the youngster at the end of his second-round
  match went viral. Before the boy had a chance to take the hat, a man to his
  right apparently reached out and grabbed it, before swiftly placing it in a
  bag. The boy appeared to plead with the man and then with Majchrzak to get it
  back. Majchrzak was busy signing autographs for other members of the crowd at
  the time and the boy was left empty-handed. Majchrzak, Poland’s No 2-ranked
  men’s player, turned to social media to track the young fan down, and later
  appeared in an Instagram post shaking hands with the boy named only as Brock.
  “Hello world, together with Brock we wish you a great day!” the caption read.
  Brock was seen pulling on a similar cap to the one that had apparently been
  snatched away from him. ‘Today after warm up, I had a nice meeting. Do you
  recognise [the cap]?” Majchrzak wrote. The 29-year-old, ranked 79 in the
  world, won his opening match at Flushing Meadows before recovering from two
  sets down to beat ninth seed Karen Khachanov in a second-round encounter that
  proved to be one of the upsets of the tournament so far. But his run came to
  an end on Saturday when he was forced to retire hurt midway through his next
  match against Switzerland’s Leandro Riedi.
