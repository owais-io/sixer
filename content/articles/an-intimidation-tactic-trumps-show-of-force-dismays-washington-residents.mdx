  Washington DC’s only Home Depot was busy with contractors and customers on
  Thursday morning – but the Hispanic day laborers who usually gather and wait
  for work under the parking lot’s sparse trees were nowhere to be found. Two
  days earlier, masked federal agents swarmed the area and made several arrests,
  which were photographed by bystanders and posted on social media. Juwan
  Brooks, a store employee who witnessed the raid, said the agents grabbed
  anyone who appeared Hispanic. “They don’t ask no questions,” Brooks said.
  People walking across the parking lot, getting out of their cars, or even
  sleeping in their vehicle – all were grabbed by the agents, leaving behind
  empty work trucks that were eventually towed away. “It was cool when Trump was
  saying it, but to actually see it first hand? I didn’t like it,” Brooks said.
  The day laborers “are not bad people”, and he wondered what happened to the
  children of the men that were taken away. Four days after Trump ordered
  federal agents and national guard on to the streets of Washington DC to fight
  a crime wave that city leaders say is not happening, residents of the capital
  are becoming used to the presence of groups of armed men in their
  neighborhoods, and the aggressive tactics they use. Beyond the apparent
  immigration arrests at Home Depot – which Brooks said was the second raid
  there he is aware of since Trump took office – federal agents have been
  spotted setting up roadblocks at busy intersections, and patrolling
  neighborhoods across the city. Trump, who exercised a never-before-used clause
  in the law governing the district to take over the Metropolitan police
  department (MPD) for 30 days, this week said he would seek Congress’s approval
  to keep it under federal control for the “long term”. It’s unclear how much of
  a difference the deployment has yet made on public safety. Rates of violent
  crime dropped to 30-year lows last year, but it remains more prevalent in
  Washington DC than many cities with similar populations. Since Trump made the
  deployment official on Monday, the city recorded two homicides, bringing its
  count for the year up to 101. “I just feel like it’s too much federal
  overreach. I think it’s unnecessary, and I think our MPD does a great job,”
  said Kevin Cataldo, a neighborhood commissioner whose district includes the
  block just north of downtown where the 100th homicide of the year took place
  on Monday, hours after Trump announced the federal takeover. The White House
  says 800 national guard troops will be on the ground in the city, along with
  hundreds of federal officers from the Drug Enforcement Administration, border
  patrol, FBI and other agencies. On Thursday afternoon, a half-dozen unarmed
  troops, who said they had been told not to talk to the press, could be found
  milling among the tourists visiting the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall,
  an area not known for crime. “What they are doing right now? It’s just a show
  of force. I did that in Iraq,” said Kevin Davis, a 21-year army veteran
  visiting the capital from El Paso, Texas. “When people see the uniform, they
  act differently.” More prevalent have been the federal agents who have
  appeared in neighborhoods across the overwhelmingly Democratic city. They
  began arriving over the weekend, and on Sunday night, a justice department
  employee was arrested for hurling a sandwich at a Customs and Border
  Protection official, and later charged with felony assault on a federal
  officer. Recent evenings have seen federal agents and police set up roadblocks
  and pull drivers over on major roads, as protesters gathered to condemn them.
  On Tuesday evening on 14th Street in Columbia Heights, a north-west Washington
  neighborhood that is home to the city’s largest Hispanic population, police
  and federal agents, some with their faces covered, began stopping cars, said a
  local shop manager who declined to be named. Before long, dozens of people
  emerged to berate them. “[Residents] were trying to tell them to leave, you
  know, the people in the street and the neighbors,” he told the Guardian. “They
  yelled back ‘don’t make the people scared, this is a free country’, ‘why make
  the community unsafe?’,” the manager said. The scene repeated a little over a
  mile south on 14th Street on Wednesday evening, with police and federal agents
  pulling over cars, and locals heckling them and trying to warn approaching
  drivers away, according to videos posted on social media. Owen Simon, an
  undergraduate government student at Georgetown University, had heard that
  agents were spotted in the tony neighborhood around campus, and wondered what
  they were doing there. Muggings happened occasionally in the neighborhood, but
  Simon said he was less concerned about those than what the agents might do to
  foreign students – or students who appeared to be foreign. “No one wants to
  walk around knowing that anyone could be scooped up out of the street at any
  moment,” he said. “I don’t think that this move by the Trump administration is
  a way to crack down on crime. I think it’s about optics.” As he smoked a
  cigarette in the Home Deport parking lot, Brooks had a similar concern about
  Congress Heights, the south-east Washington neighborhood where he lives. Crime
  there is undoubtedly a concern, but it was teenagers who were behind it, not
  his working-class neighbors. “You got other people catching strays off that,
  too,” he said. “You got working people living in the neighborhood, going to
  the store, getting picked up because of 16-, 17-year-olds. “I understand
  targeting the area, but you can’t really blame the people in the area who are
  trying to do better,” he added. Over the weekend, he had seen eight cars full
  of federal agents driving through his neighborhood like they wanted to be
  seen, something he had never witnessed the city police do. “What is this for?”
  he wondered. “It’s more of an intimidation tactic.” Joseph Gedeon contributed
