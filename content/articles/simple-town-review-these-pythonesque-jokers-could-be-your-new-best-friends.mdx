webTitle: Simple Town review – these Pythonesque jokers could be your new best friends

  With sketch comedy not exactly cresting a wave in the UK right now, why not
  import some cult-favourite exponents from the other side of the pond? If that
  were the thinking behind this fringe debut by NYC four-piece Simple Town –
  well, it might just be smart, fresh and funny enough to revitalise the form.
  It’s sketch with something of the energy of improv, a hint of an easygoing get
  together with your coolest friends (OK, far cooler than my friends) – and the
  kind of freewheeling, elusive-logic comedy with which Sheeps have in recent
  years sustained sketch’s flagging pulse. Identified as “four teens in their
  30s”, Simple Town introduce themselves as they mean to go on: super-casual,
  faux-naive, coming at one another, and at our expectations, from odd angles.
  Their first sketch takes us back vaguely in time, to three Nasa bros aghast
  that a woman has been recruited to their space programme – because “she can do
  multiplication in her head!”. Like later scenes, this one contains several
  movements, the borders porous between them, the comic point forever evolving
  and slipping beyond your grasp. If you like that sensation, of laughing
  without ever fully pinning down why, Simple Town are your new best friends.
  What’s going on in the skit that pairs two cagoule-clad spare thumbs left
  alone together at their respective partners’ reunion? This dotty choreography
  of social awkwardness extrapolated ad absurdum is as beguiling as it is barely
  explicable. You could read their firing squad sketch as a brilliant riff on
  the polarised US, where fierceness of conviction is matched only by woolliness
  of argument. It’s also just a nugget of Pythonesque nonsense about dopey
  executioners. Some routines are simpler, like the solipsistic inner monologue
  of the audience member whose suggestion is accepted for an improv scene. Or
  like the show’s closer, burlesquing middle-class American reverence for old
  Europe – although even that one morphs halfway into a four Yorkshiremen-style
  race to the bottom of US education. It’s all accomplished with artless slacker
  panache by Will Niedmann, Caroline Yost, Felipe Di Poi Tamargo and Sam Lanier,
  posting a welcome reminder of how exciting team comedy can still be. • At
  Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival
