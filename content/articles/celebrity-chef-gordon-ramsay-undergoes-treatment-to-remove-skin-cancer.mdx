  The celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has said he has undergone treatment to remove
  skin cancer, thanking “incredible” health workers for their efforts and urging
  fans to remember to wear sun protection. Ramsay, 58, said he had basal cell
  carcinoma, a non-melanoma form of skin cancer, removed, in a post on
  Instagram. A picture showed dressings below his ear where the cancer had been
  removed. “Grateful and so appreciative for the incredible team at The Skin
  Associates and their fast reactive work on removing this basal cell carcinoma,
  thank you,” the Kitchen Nightmares star said. “Please don’t forget your
  sunscreen this weekend, I promise you it’s not a facelift. I’d need a refund.”
  Ramsay received messages of support from famous friends including the TV judge
  Robert Rinder, who posted a heart emoji. Ramsay’s daughter Holly wrote “love
  you dad” with a heart emoji. A reply to the post from the charity Cancer
  Research UK read: “Glad to hear you’re doing well, Gordon, and thanks for
  raising awareness of how important it is to stay safe in the sun. “Seek shade,
  cover up and apply sunscreen regularly and generously.” The NHS says basal
  cell carcinoma is a non-melanoma form of skin cancer, which starts in the top
  layer of skin and is mainly caused by ultraviolet light which comes from the
  sun and is used in sunbeds. It says the main symptom of the condition is a
  growth or unusual patch on the skin, which can vary in size and appearance,
  most common in areas including the head, neck and shoulders, back, hands and
  lower legs. Ramsay is also known for presenting Hell’s Kitchen and appearing
  in ITV’s Gordon, Gino and Fred road trip series, in which he travels with his
  fellow chef Gino d’Acampo and the First Dates maitre d’hotel Fred Sirieix. The
  chef also runs Gordon Ramsay Restaurants, whose venues have received 17
  Michelin stars overall, and currently boast eight.
