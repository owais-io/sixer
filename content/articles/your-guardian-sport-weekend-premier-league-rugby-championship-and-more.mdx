  Saturday 8am (all times BST) Matchday live Football There is no escape. The
  Football League has held centre stage on the past two Saturdays but now the
  Premier League is screaming for our attention and we must surrender. Barry
  Glendenning and Rob Smyth will guide you through all the reaction to Friday
  night’s Liverpool v Bournemouth opener, plus the buildup to Saturday’s five
  top-flight matches and all the latest transfer stories, for those more
  interested in who’s winning the window than who’s winning actual games. We
  won’t ignore the lower divisions, including Wrexham’s first home game back in
  the Championship, against West Brom at 12.30pm, after a couple of Hollywood
  endings in league (agony) and Carabao Cup (ecstasy). Peter Lansley will report
  from Villa Park on the lead-up to the lunchtime game while Ed Aarons, who is
  covering Tottenham v Burnley, will be answering your questions. Email
  matchday.live@theguardian.com to take part. 10.15am Australia v South Africa
  third T20i Cricket The England and Wales Cricket Board may have sacrificed
  staging international cricket in August in favour of the Hundred, but there’s
  a series decider going on in Cairns. South Africa won the first match thanks
  to an astonishing unbeaten 125 off 56 balls from Dewald Brevis that ended the
  hosts’ unbeaten run of nine, while three wickets apiece for Josh Hazlewood and
  Ben Dwarshuis evened things up for Australia in the second match. Geoff Lemon
  is on over-by-over duty. 12.30pm Aston Villa v Newcastle Football The fixture
  computer can be a mean machine: Aston Villa, denied a lead at Manchester
  United on the last day by a premature referee’s whistle in a game they went on
  to lose, start the season by facing Newcastle, who edged them out of a
  Champions League place on goal difference. As the late Jim Bowen would have
  put it on Bullseye: “Here’s what you would have won.” Jacob Ramsey will be in
  the Champions League after leaving Villa for St James’ Park, though probably
  not in time to figure here. Barry Glendenning will be on minute-by-minute duty
  – perhaps Alexander Isak will have a look on his phone to see how things are
  going – while Peter Lansley will be at Villa Park to find out if Unai Emery
  has calmed down since his Old Trafford meltdown. 1.45pm Clockwatch Football
  The staggered start denies us the thrill that used to accompany opening day
  but the first 3pm Premier League team news of the season will be announced
  now, while three lunchtime games in the Championship will be drawing to a
  close: Derby v Coventry and Portsmouth v Norwich, as well as Wrexham’s game,
  from where Sam Dalling will be reporting. Rob Smyth will guide you through all
  the news and then action from around the grounds, with Brighton v Fulham,
  Sunderland v West Ham and Tottenham v Burnley from the top division. In the
  Championship, can Sheffield United steady the ship at Swansea after the
  Bristol City debacle and a Carabao Cup exit at Birmingham? We will have
  reports and reaction from all the Premier League games, plus roundups from the
  lower divisions. 4.10pm South Africa v Australia Rugby union Fresh from taming
  the Lions in the third Test (to leave some of their fans claiming a moral
  series victory), Joe Schmidt’s Wallabies now have to prove they are genuinely
  back in business against top-notch regular opposition, rather than a deluxe
  scratch side. A respectable scoreline in the Rugby Championship opener against
  the world champions at Ellis Park in Johannesburg would suggest that Australia
  are heading in the right direction as the countdown to their home World Cup in
  2027 continues, while South Africa are trying to retain this title for the
  first time. Daniel Gallan is on live duty for us, and will then be analysing
  what went right and wrong for both teams. 5.30pm Wolves v Manchester City
  Football Molineux will stage its own tributes to Diogo Jota and his brother
  before the game against Manchester City. On the visiting side, Rúben Dias and
  Bernardo Silva both played alongside Jota in his last match, Portugal’s
  Nations League triumph against Spain. After the obsequies are concluded, the
  sides will set about each other in a fixture that was won last season by John
  Stones’ added-time header. Whatever else has happened, both sides will have a
  chance of finishing the day top of the table and you can bet that Pep
  Guardiola would welcome such an early statement of intent. Scott Murray will
  helm our coverage of the buildup and the match itself, while Ben Fisher will
  report from the ground. Sunday 8am Matchday live Football Along with the
  results, Saturday could throw up some talking points arising from the
  refereeing changes introduced for this season. Will we see a corner awarded
  for a goalkeeper holding on to the ball for too long? What about defenders
  being penalised for holding? John Brewin – our man at Brighton v Fulham on
  Saturday – will chair the discussion on what has gone before and tee up the
  afternoon’s action, with the help of our reporter at Old Trafford, Jamie
  Jackson. Email matchday.live@theguardian.com to discuss whether Ruben Amorim
  can fix the Manchester United malaise and whether Mikel Arteta’s
  reinforcements have given him an Arsenal team capable of going one better.
  We’ll also have updates on the Championship battle between two relegated
  sides, Ipswich and Southampton. 2pm Chelsea v Crystal Palace Football Two
  serial trophy winners meet at Stamford Bridge: Conference League and Club
  World Cup winners Chelsea take on FA Cup and Community Shield holders Crystal
  Palace. Oliver Glasner would like to hold on to the key names that helped
  Palace to those Wembley successes, especially Eberechi Eze. For Enzo Maresca,
  it all seems to be coming together nicely, but his players have hardly had a
  holiday thanks to Gianni Infantino’s brainwave. Join Daniel Harris for live
  coverage of this match and updates on Nottingham Forest v Brentford, while
  Jacob Steinberg will have a match report and reaction. 4.30pm Manchester
  United v Arsenal Football For many, many years, fixture computer rules about
  keeping the previous season’s top four apart on the opening weekend would have
  ruled out a Manchester United v Arsenal clash, but last season the hosts
  finished lower in the final table than in the alphabetical list of teams for
  the first time in a generation. With a new-look attack in place, Ruben Amorim
  will seek a statement win, but Arsenal have also strengthened as they seek to
  end their title drought. Rob Smyth will provide minute-by-minute updates,
  while Jamie Jackson and Jonathan Wilson will cover the news, reaction and
  analysis from Old Trafford.
