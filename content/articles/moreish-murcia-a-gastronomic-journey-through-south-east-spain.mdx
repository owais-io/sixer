  ‘My grandmother, a widow, sold her livestock in the 1940s and bought this land
  to start a vineyard. That’s where she made the wine,” says Pepa Fernández
  proudly, pointing towards a weathered building no bigger than a garden shed.
  We’re standing between two fields on a chalky road skirted by poppies, daisies
  and thistles. One field is lined with neat rows of lush vines, the other with
  small bush vines soon to bear monastrell grapes (the most dominant variety in
  these parts). In the distance, a sandy-coloured mountain range peppered with
  pine trees sits beneath a cloudless blue sky. Pocket-sized Pepa is the face of
  Bodega Balcona, a family-run organic winery in Spain’s south-eastern province
  of Murcia. The vineyard lies in the picturesque Aceniche valley, in Bullas –
  one of Murcia’s three wine DOPs (denominaciónes de origen protegida),
  alongside Yecla and Jumilla. Each has its own wine route, scattered with
  museums and vineyards. My girlfriend and I are in the area to explore Murcia’s
  food and drink scene after a tipoff from an old friend who grew up in the city
  (the Region of Murcia is the name of the province ). The province hosted two
  of Spain’s most prestigious culinary events last year: the Repsol Guide Soles
  gala and the Michelin Guide gala. “Murcia is one of the best food cities in
  Spain,” a suave Granada-based gentleman in a fedora tells me on the way to the
  tasting room. We soon learn that its wine is pretty special, too, as we make
  our way through Bodega Balcona’s roster of earthy natural wines. Each glass is
  paired with national and regional dishes: cold cuts, local cheeses, almonds,
  tuna empanadas, and a Murcian favourite made by Pepa’s nephew, pastel de carne
  – a hearty meat and egg pie topped with flaky pastry. After, we drive to the
  nearby Salto del Usero waterfall, where kids are paddling and teenagers are
  sunning themselves on rocks, like lizards. Following a quick dip in the chilly
  plunge pool, we go to meet Paco Franciso Muñoz Reales, who runs an organic
  farm nearby with his German wife, Heidi. Laid-back and softly spoken, Paco is
  part of a local cooperative of growers, including Pepa, using ecological
  farming methods. He explains there was a little bit of tension with local
  farmers when he first started, but things have settled down. On a tour of his
  five-hectare estate, he shows me a seed bank tucked inside a pantry, rows of
  apricot, olive and lemon trees, and a tomato patch. Nicknamed the garden of
  Europe, Murcia accounts for around 20% of Spain’s fruit and vegetable exports.
  This agricultural heritage stems from a vast network of fertile gardens, or
  huertos, that surround the city of Murcia, where baroque buildings, palm-lined
  riverbanks and buzzing tapas bars cluster around Plaza de las Flores. La
  Huerta de Murcia, as the fertile area is called, also influences local food
  culture, with Sundays traditionally reserved for family meals at rustic
  restaurants. Each spring, the city also throws the Bando de la Huerta festival
  – a lively celebration of rural life where locals don traditional dress and
  feast on regional dishes. We arrive a few weeks later, so instead visit the
  rustic El Cañal Los Almillas restaurant, where we tuck into heaped platters of
  beef entrecote dusted with a layer of rock salt, and a fresh tomato salad with
  olives and lettuce, accompanied by plates of lemon (Murcianos squeeze lemon on
  everything). We finish with a classic Murcian dessert of crispy, deep-fried
  paparajotes – battered lemon leaves served with a dollop of ice-cream. The
  restaurant is named after the city’s canal system, which are part of an
  irrigation system dating back to Moorish times. “Think of it as the Segura
  River being the heart and the canals the veins that deliver the blood,” our
  guide, Antonio, explains. David López, the chef at the fine-dining restaurant
  Local de Ensayo, tells us these ancient systems are still in use today as he
  shows us around his huerto. López visits his patch daily, growing everything
  from lettuce, beans and cucumber to strawberries and aubergines. Fruit and
  vegetables feature prominently in traditional Murcian cooking, in dishes such
  as ensalada murciana (tomato salad with tuna, olives and egg) and arroz con
  verduras (rice with vegetables). “It’s a way of life for me, somewhere I can
  bring the children to plant things and watch them grow,” López says while
  trudging through the mud, checking his crops. About 20% of the produce used in
  his restaurant comes from his garden, the rest being supplied by an ecological
  farmer with a stall at Verónicas market, which sells fruit, vegetables, meat,
  fish and olive oil to the city. López and his wife, Carmen, show us around the
  market, pointing out local delicacies like mújol (mullet), almendra marcona
  (almonds), langostino del Mar Menor (langoustines) and alficoz (a type of
  curly cucumber). We finish at Café Bar Verónicas, which to the untrained eye
  looks like any other neighbourhood bar: metal countertops, shelves of pickled
  vegetables and wine, and locals chatting loudly. However, framed newspaper
  reviews hint at something more. It’s run by Samuel Ruiz and his wife, Isabel
  Torrecillas. The young, tattooed chef could be Spain’s Anthony Bourdain. Ruiz,
  who trained at the famed El Bulli, was responsible for one of Murcia’s most
  exciting restaurants, Kome, a tiny Japanese-style tavern. “They didn’t have
  social media. No website. Nothing. But people still queued down the street,”
  Carmen tells us. Ruiz decided to shut down Kome and return to his roots,
  opening a barra with a twist in the heart of town, she explains as a plate of
  caballito (little horse in Spanish) lands on the table. The popular local dish
  usually features deep-fried prawns, only here it’s made with fist-sized
  crayfish, shell and all. It’s followed by a good-sized bowl of marinera, a
  kind of Russian salad with anchovies, served with crisp bread and homemade
  mayo. When I ask Ruiz what sauce he’s plating up, he squirts a dot on to the
  back of my hand. “Try it,” he grins confidently. It is a delicious homemade
  saffron mayonnaise with anchovy, lemon and garlic. A frozen cocktail with an
  umbrella appears moments later, sent from his other bar next door, Colmado San
  Julián. We finish up and say our goodbyes before wandering over to López’s
  restaurant. As we enter, he vanishes without a word and we’re seated by a
  window peering into the kitchen. Dishes soon arrive at the table from his
  excellent tasting menu (from about £65), which champions local, seasonal
  ingredients. Standout plates include a wild mushroom dish packed with umami, a
  deep-flavoured red Calasparra rice with vegetables, and his excellent
  signature dessert, a cross between a flan and a crème brûlée (a favourite of
  the legendary Spanish food critic José Carlos Capel). The next day we drive 45
  minutes out of town to Casa Borrego – a cosy eight-room gastronomic hotel with
  soft bucolic rooms and a burbling beck outside. For dinner, we’re treated to
  an elevated take on Murcian cuisine, including pani puri balls exploding with
  tuna tartare, and a massive pan of rich rabbit rice. Retiring to bed, we’re
  lulled to sleep by the sound of trickling water. With our time in Murcia
  nearly up, the following day we zip back to the city to hunt down one last
  dish: zarangollo, a simple courgette-and-egg scramble. We find it at a
  traditional tapas bar called Bodegón Los Toneles – all jamón legs and
  chalkboard menus. We end the trip as we began with a local tipple, this time
  at CaféLab. Asiático is a heady blend of condensed milk, Licor 43, cognac and
  spices – said to hail from Cartagena. Like Murcia’s cuisine, its richness lies
  in the subtle layers – each one revealing something original, unexpected and
  distinctly its own. The trip was provided by Turismo Región de Murcia.
