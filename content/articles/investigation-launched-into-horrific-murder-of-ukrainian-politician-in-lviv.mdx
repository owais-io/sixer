  A Ukrainian former parliamentary speaker was shot dead in Lviv on Saturday,
  authorities said, as European foreign ministers met to discuss increasing
  pressure on Moscow to end its war against Ukraine. Andriy Parubiy, a member of
  parliament who served as parliamentary speaker from 2016 to 2019 and a key
  figure in Ukraine’s 2013 pro-European Maidan revolution, was shot dead,
  prosecutors said. A murder investigation has been launched and the president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned the killing as a “horrific murder”. Europe’s
  foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss possible measures to force
  Moscow to the negotiating table. Speaking at a press conference after the
  meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was
  “clearly not preparing for peace”. “The European Union and all the member
  states support the diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and the end of Russia’s
  war. But it’s clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the
  opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Ministers also discussed
  the war in Gaza and the deepening humanitarian crisis there. The summit, which
  was an informal meeting and as such did not involve ministers committing to
  any concrete steps, took place at the end of a violent week. Russia launched a
  large airstrike on Kyiv, killing at least 21 people on Thursday. There was
  also an overnight strike on a five-storey residential building that killed one
  person and injured 24 others in Zaporizhzhia, and the Dnipropetrovsk region
  faced a “massive attack” early on Saturday, its governor said, with strikes in
  Dnipro and Pavlograd. Since the invasion of Ukraine, the EU has imposed 18
  packages of sanctions against Russia, with the latest adopted in July.
  Ministers on Saturday discussed options for a fresh package, with measures
  floated including import bans and tariffs; secondary sanctions, which would
  affect third parties trading with the country; and stepping up efforts against
  Russian shadow fleet ships, which have been used to evade western sanctions on
  its oil exports. The question of using Russia’s frozen assets for Ukraine’s
  reconstruction was also discussed. “Ministers acknowledged the need to address
  Ukraine’s financing gap and to hold Russia accountable for war damages. To
  achieve this, it is crucial to explore all avenues while minimising the
  potential risks,” Kallas said, underlining that financial markets “did not
  react when the assets were frozen”. “One thing is clear: given the devastation
  Russia has caused and is causing, it is unthinkable that Russia will ever see
  this money again unless it fully compensates Ukraine for damages caused,” she
  said. The cost of Ukraine’s reconstruction has been estimated at €506bn
  (£438bn) over the next decade. Ministers will propose next steps in the coming
  week, the EU foreign policy chief said, noting that any action taken “would be
  stronger if matched by our transatlantic partners”. The Danish foreign
  minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, said Russia’s leader would only respond to
  “hard pressure”. “I think everybody agrees it’s very clear that Putin is
  trying to buy time and divert attention from the massive and brutal attacks on
  Ukraine. He must not succeed – the only language he understands is that of
  hard pressure.” Zelenskyy on Saturday accused Russia of using “the time meant
  for preparing a leaders’-level meeting to organise new massive attacks” and
  called for “tough measures” in the form of banking and energy sanctions.
