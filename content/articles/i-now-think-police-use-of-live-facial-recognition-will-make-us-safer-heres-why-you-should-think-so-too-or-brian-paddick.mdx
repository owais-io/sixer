  I was a Metropolitan police officer for more than 30 years and policed Notting
  Hill carnival for many of them, from the anti-police violence of the 1970s as
  a constable, to being a chief inspector bronze commander in the 1990s. In the
  2000s, when the rightwing press succeeded in removing “an openly gay police
  commander who was soft on drugs” (I advocated alternatives to arresting people
  for small amounts of cannabis) as the cop in charge of Brixton, “the capital
  of Black Britain”, local people signed a 5,000-signature petition and held a
  rally at Brixton town hall demanding my reinstatement. So, when Mark Rowley
  recruited me in 2023 as an “access all areas” non-executive director of the
  Met, I was not a “no-risk hire”, as the commissioner put it. I am still
  concerned about the culture of the Met and the disproportionate use of police
  powers against black people, especially “stop and search”, but I am no longer
  concerned about the way the Met uses live facial recognition (LFR). Millions
  of people attend Notting Hill carnival every year and succeed in their sole
  aim of having a wonderful time, but having so many people in such a small area
  attracts a tiny minority intent on exploiting the situation to commit crime,
  including violence and sexual offences. LFR provides a non-discriminatory way
  of identifying some of those offenders on their way to the event with zero
  impact on anyone else. Past failings, which meant live facial recognition was
  more likely to misidentify black people and women, have been eradicated at the
  settings used by the Met, and it would be self-defeating if the force used
  this technology in any other way; false positives are currently running at one
  in 33,000 for everyone. The systems “sees” people’s faces, compares them with
  specific police databases of facial images, and immediately discards the live
  images if there isn’t a match. It’s like watching TV without recording it,
  unless there’s a match, and if there is anyone else in the shot, they are
  automatically pixelated out. The types of image databases used are, for
  example, of people on the sex offenders register who have restrictions on
  where they should be, and those wanted for serious criminal offences. A match
  results in officers engaging the individual in a conversation to establish
  exactly who they are and what they are doing there. It would be much better if
  there were a consolidated, statutory framework that specifically addressed
  live facial recognition, instead of the many and various legal checks and
  balances currently in place, but that failure lies at the door of successive
  governments. The Met doesn’t get everything right, but I trust those
  responsible for the development and deployment of live facial recognition, and
  compared with other police crime prevention measures, such as blanket,
  no-suspicion “stop and search”, it is much less intrusive. The days when we
  used to say, “trust me, I’m a police officer” are sadly in the past, but
  things are improving. As a former police whistleblower, I wouldn’t say it if I
  didn’t believe it. Brian Paddick is a peer, a former senior police officer and
  a non-executive adviser for the Metropolitan police
