  Half a dozen soldiers at a Georgia army base have been awarded medals for
  tackling an armed assailant accused of shooting five people and then giving
  aid to their wounded colleagues, three of whom have now been released from
  hospital. Sgt Quornelius Radford, 28, who was assigned to Fort Stewart, is
  accused of using a personal handgun to shoot five of his fellow soldiers on
  Wednesday before he was quickly tackled by other troops. Army officials would
  not speculate about a motive. “The fast action of these soldiers under stress
  and under trauma and under fire absolutely saved lives from being lost,” the
  army secretary, Dan Driscoll, said at a news briefing on Thursday morning.
  “One of the soldiers tackled the person, so just think about this – they were
  unarmed and ran at and tackled an armed person who they knew was actively
  shooting their buddies, their colleagues, their fellow soldiers. “Another
  soldier jumped on top of the person to subdue them until federal law
  enforcement was able to arrive.” According to CNN, the soldier who was the
  first to subdue the suspect has been named by the army as Staff Sgt Aaron
  Turner, with Master Sgt Justin Thomas helping to keep him restrained. Four
  other soldiers tended to the wounded, according to Driscoll. One of them,
  Staff Sgt Melissa Taylor, said she was in her office when she heard a fellow
  soldier “yelling that a gunshot went off”. After peering into the hallway and
  seeing smoke, she noticed a soldier lying on the ground. “I immediately
  sprinted over to the soldier and started rendering aid. He had been shot. And
  so I was rendering aid to him, while the first sergeant started calling
  medics,” she told reporters. The six soldiers were awarded the meritorious
  service medal for “outstanding non-combat meritorious achievement or service”
  on Thursday. The shooting occurred in the 2nd armored brigade combat team
  area, where Radford worked. Brig Gen John Lubas, commander of the third
  infantry division and Fort Stewart-Hunter army airfield, said two of the five
  soldiers who were shot remain hospitalized. “One solider remains as an
  in-patient at Winn Army [community hospital] right here on Fort Stewart. She’s
  doing very well, in high spirits,” Lubas said in comments reported by CNN. “Of
  course, she’s got a little bit of a road to recovery. We’re hopeful she may be
  released as early as this weekend but that will just depend on how things heal
  up over the next couple of days.” Another solider who was more seriously
  injured is recovering at Savannah Memorial community hospital, about 45 miles
  from the base, the general said. “She’s got a little bit longer road to
  recovery. The doctors are very positive, but I think it’s going to take her a
  big longer to recover. They’re very hopeful she’s going to make a complete
  recovery.” The other three shooting survivors were released yesterday,
  according to Lubas. The Army has not identified them nor the nature of their
  injuries. According to the New York Times, Radford sent a text message to his
  aunt on Wednesday morning which said that he “loved everybody, and that he’ll
  be in a better place because he was about to go and do something”. Radford’s
  father told the Times he hadn’t noticed anything unusual about his son’s
  behavior recently, and didn’t know what might have led him to attack his
  fellow soldiers. Radford remains in custody.
