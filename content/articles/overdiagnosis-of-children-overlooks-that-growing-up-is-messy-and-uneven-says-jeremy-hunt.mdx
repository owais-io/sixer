  Children and young people are being overdiagnosed with mental health
  conditions in a society that has lost sight of the reality that child
  development is “messy and uneven”, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has
  said. He is the latest senior figure to add his voice to calls for a radical
  overhaul of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system in
  England. Hunt said in his half decade as health secretary, he witnessed “an
  alarming escalation” in the prevalence and severity of mental ill-health among
  young people, as well as significant increases in diagnoses of
  neurodevelopmental conditions. In a foreword to a new report by the
  centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, Hunt said: “Mental ill-health and
  neurodiversity now accounts for more than half of the post-pandemic increase
  we have seen in claimants of disability benefit. Spending on Send provision
  has sky-rocketed and risks the financial sustainability of local government.
  “Rather than assuming that more money or more of the same is the answer, we
  need to ask more fundamental questions. Is a cash transfer – or a label that
  means young people are treated and come to see themselves as different – the
  right way to help them?” He added: “Across the political spectrum, and amongst
  a growing range of practitioners, it is now recognised that there is a level
  of ‘overdiagnosis’ [in] our system. We need to cut through the complexity to
  better understand the drivers of demand we are seeing.” Hunt, who is
  Conservative MP for Godalming and Ash, and has also served as chancellor and
  foreign secretary under the Conservatives, said: “As a society, we seem to
  have lost sight of the fundamental reality that child development is a messy
  and uneven process. “Our laudable desire to ensure young people are happy and
  well-supported is at times manifesting in excessive impulses to medicalise and
  diagnose the routine in a manner that can undercut grit and resilience.” The
  government is expected to publish a white paper later this year detailing how
  it plans to reform the Send system. Parents are concerned that education,
  health and care plans (EHCPs) – legally enforceable documents that detail a
  child or young person’s needs, and the support they require – will be
  targeted. In January this year the number of EHCPs in place rose to 638,745 –
  up 10.8% on the same point last year. The Policy Exchange report, Out of
  Control, says EHCPs should be limited to students in special schools and that
  school mental health support should be targeted at those “that most need it,
  rather than blanket offers”. Tania Tirraoro, co-director of Special Needs
  Jungle, a parent-led Send website, said: “It’s a bit rich of Jeremy Hunt to
  claim this, given his government presided over deep cuts to public services,
  including Camhs [Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services], a narrowed
  curriculum, meaning children who thrived in arts and practical subjects were
  cut adrift, and a botched response to the pandemic. “What we are seeing now is
  the result of that – young people who have grown up in a hostile environment,
  trying to navigate an explosion of unregulated social media and without the
  support services they need. It is most certainly not widely accepted that
  there is an overdiagnosis – this is something put out by people like him to
  deflect from these failings.” The Department for Education was approached for
  comment. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, previously said the
  government will protect the legal right to additional support for children
  with Send.
