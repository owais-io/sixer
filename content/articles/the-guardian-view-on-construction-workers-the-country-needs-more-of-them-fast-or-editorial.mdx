  During the 1980s, the construction industry provided the backdrop to one of
  Britain’s best-loved television comedies. Auf Wiedersehen, Pet chronicled the
  progress of three Geordie bricklayers as they fled a recession-hit country to
  seek work in Düsseldorf. That was then. A contemporary reworking would need to
  start from a radically different premise. Notwithstanding the contribution of
  a large migrant workforce, the modern construction sector is underpowered and
  dramatically understaffed. Annual job vacancies total about 38,000, half of
  which cannot be filled due to a shortage of skills. For a government committed
  to sustainably building 1.5m new homes and environmentally upgrading the
  existing housing stock – as well as renewing national infrastructure more
  generally – that is a serious problem. The Construction Industry Training
  Board has estimated that between now and 2029, about 240,000 new hires will be
  needed. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, hopes that some of them
  will be alumni of 10 “new technical excellence colleges”, whose locations were
  unveiled this week. The government has already pledged to invest £600m in the
  training of 60,000 construction workers by 2029. The 10 colleges are being
  handed another £100m to enhance the skillsets of a future generation of
  bricklayers, electricians, carpenters and plumbers. “New” is stretching it a
  bit. All the colleges already exist and have a track record in offering
  construction courses. Whether the scale of the government’s intervention is
  adequate to the size of the challenge is, to say the least, moot. But Ms
  Phillipson’s apparent determination to prioritise the sector is both necessary
  and welcome. One in eight young people are currently not in education,
  employment or training; making vocational career paths accessible and
  attractive is a social as well as an economic imperative. Sadly, there is a
  vast amount of lost ground to make up. Overall investment in skills has
  dropped calamitously since 2010, and a myopic ministerial focus on
  universities has seen further education colleges treated as second-class
  institutions. The apprenticeship levy scheme introduced by the Conservatives
  in 2017 was a dismal failure, as employers invested in already skilled
  employees rather than entry-level opportunities. Via Skills England – the new
  body it has created – Labour has moved to reform the levy. But comparisons
  with Germany’s longstanding vocational education system, which enjoys high
  status and delivers a rounded learning environment to students, remain deeply
  unflattering. The construction industry also has its own issues to resolve.
  Cultural expectations have transformed since the days when Auf Wiedersehen,
  Pet was broadcast. In a recent survey, more than a third of young people did
  not view a job in construction as a respected career path. More than half
  considered the sector not welcoming to women. Many employers are failing to
  invest in training. And as the use of migrant labour has become increasingly
  prevalent, there has been concerning evidence of exploitative practices. If
  hugely ambitious Westminster targets are to be met, foreign workers and new
  native talent will both be required (a home truth that the government is
  depressingly reluctant to acknowledge). Rendering the construction sector fit
  for purpose should be viewed as a national mission. The reward would be a
  viable vocational path for tens of thousands of young people. Labour is at
  least making a start. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
  article? If you would like to submit a response of up to 300 words by email to
