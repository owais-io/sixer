  I used Booking.com to book a bed at Safestay Holland Park hostel on a work
  trip to London this month. Arriving at midnight, I discovered bedbugs crawling
  on the mattress, pillow and walls. Staff moved me to another building, which
  was also infested. I spent the night awake at reception. Exhaustion forced me
  to take a dawn train home, costing a new ticket and my freelance fee as I was
  unable to work. I also had to buy new clothes and do multiple wash cycles to
  avoid bringing the infestation back with me. My expenses came to £265. I’ve
  since read dozens of comments on review websites reporting bedbugs at the same
  hostel and similar complaints about three of the other five UK Safestay
  hostels. After I filed a formal report, Kensington and Chelsea council
  enforced pest control treatment. The hostel manager offered £250 compensation
  but I’m still waiting, while Booking.com has not replied to my complaint.
  There were other guests left in my infested room without any action taken.
  There seems a systemic failure of safety and corporate responsibility. MF,
  Exeter There are graphic reports on review websites going back to 2022,
  including from guests who stayed at the Holland Park hostel before and after
  you did. Accommodation providers are legally required to ensure rooms are safe
  and hygienic, which means infestations must be dealt with as soon as they are
  discovered. I asked Safestay why the bugs, clearly visible when you arrived,
  had not been spotted by housekeeping. It insists daily inspections are made
  and a pest control company treats outbreaks. “We apologise,” it says. “Once
  notified, we scheduled treatment, and affected rooms were blocked off.
  Environmental health visited and is satisfied with the actions.” I asked
  Booking.com why, given the significance of the issue, it had not promptly
  responded to your complaint. It didn’t answer that but did, immediately, issue
  a refund and suspended the hostel from its platform. It says: “We have
  contacted the partner to ensure the issue is promptly addressed.” We welcome
  letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at
  consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Consumer Champions, Money, the
