  A former police officer has been awarded $2.3m after a car accident during a
  cannabis clearing operation that led to the amputation of her arm and the
  “complete destruction” of her earning capacity. In a district court decision
  handed down in Sydney on Friday, acting judge Leonard Levy SC found the state
  of New South Wales had breached its duty of care to the former officer Jillian
  Oliver, and that its negligence had resulted in the accident, her injuries,
  and her “catastrophic” physical and psychological situation. The medically
  retired senior constable sustained multiple physical injuries to her head,
  neck, right shoulder and wrist in the crash on the NSW mid-north coast in
  November 2010. Oliver, who was 34 at the time, had been with a colleague
  collecting cannabis plants from an illegal plantation in Dingo Tops state
  forest. Oliver was driving a 4x4 ute containing what she estimated to be 740
  uprooted cannabis plants, the court heard. The officers had been instructed to
  load the culled cannabis plants on to the vehicle and take them to a
  designated mustering location for identification and destruction. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email On the return journey, the heavily loaded Ford Ranger 4WD
  – which was not fitted with off-road tyres – lost traction on a corner,
  fishtailed and veered off the dirt road before it “bounced” down a steep
  embankment and came to a rest in dense forest 175 metres below the track.
  Oliver was rescued from the crash site with the help of a helicopter. As well
  as her extensive physical injuries, she also incurred psychological injuries
  and developed intractable complex regional pain syndrome, which led to the
  amputation of her right arm below the elbow. In her workplace injury damages
  claim filed in March 2024, Oliver alleged the car was overloaded and that her
  employer had failed to provide warnings and training about its safe loading.
  She was unable to weigh the loaded plants and did not know what the load
  limits of the vehicle were. Levy found the negligence of NSW police had
  resulted in the accident, injuries and development of a “complex regional pain
  syndrome, unremitting pain, surgical amputation of her right arm below the
  elbow, and the resultant major depressive disorder that has blighted her life
  and has prevented her from working”. He awarded Oliver $2.3m, which included
  $1.12m for lost future earning capacity, plus costs. “Plainly, she leads a
  stressful existence … She feels that she is not living a life, and she is just
  existing,” Levy wrote in his judgment. “I find that the aftermath of the
  accident and the plaintiff’s disabilities … has been the complete destruction
  of her capacity for any form of meaningful remunerative work.” During the
  proceedings, counsel for the state of NSW, the respondent in the case,took
  issue with Oliver’s lawyers’ claims about the weight, size and number of
  culled cannabis plants in the vehicle. They also alleged contributory
  negligence against Oliver, claiming she had been driving too fast, unsafely
  and not in accordance with her training at the time of the accident. But Levy
  rejected those claims, saying Oliver had no reasonable way of knowing the
  likely total weight of the load and that it was the employer’s responsibility
  to manage potential risks, “such as by at least providing some scales that
  could be used to measure culled cannabis plant weights whilst working in the
  field”. The plants were “lost to recovery” after the accident – their
  retrieval was “understandably, a lesser police priority”, Levy wrote – and so
  could not have been subsequently weighed. There had been seven similar
  rollover incidents in the NSW police force in the 15 months before the
  accident, sparking safety concerns that led to industrial action over the
  vehicle’s use, according to the judgment. “In my view, the risk of potential
  vehicle instability and uncontrollability leading to an accident foreseeably
  arose,” he wrote. He said it was “plain that the risk assessment undertaken by
  the police force did not sufficiently address the material risks inherent in
  the system of work” for the implementation of its cannabis eradication
  program.
