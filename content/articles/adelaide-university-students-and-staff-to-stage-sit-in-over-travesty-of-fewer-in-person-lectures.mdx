  Students and staff at Adelaide University will stage a campus sit-in on Monday
  after the newly amalgamated institution announced it would cancel most
  in-person lectures when it officially opens next year. The protest, to take
  place outside the office of the vice-chancellor, is the latest escalation in
  the Save Our Lectures campaign, initiated by students at the University of
  Adelaide and UniSA after staff were informed last September that traditional
  lectures would no longer form a part of courses. The move, criticised at the
  time as accelerating the “death of campus life” by the National Tertiary
  Education Union (Nteu), led to the Group of Eight (Go8) universities releasing
  a statement the next month saying the majority of learning would remain in
  person, where it suited the subject. Interim vice-chancellors Peter Hoj and
  David Lloyd said in the statement that “in an era marked by rapid
  technological advancement … we have arrived at a point of much needed
  re-evaluation and reinvention”. “The new Adelaide University is setting out to
  deliver the most contemporary, accessible and future-focused curriculum in the
  nation,” they said. Student organiser for the campaign, Poppy Pilmore, said
  despite the university’s official communications, staff had privately
  confirmed that most lectures would be pre-recorded digital content, raising
  concerns about transparency and education standards. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email “This is not flexibility. It’s the worrying trend of students losing
  choice,” she said. “Many students learn best through face-to-face classes.
  Removing in-person lectures disadvantages those who need structure, community
  and direct engagement with teaching staff.” Pilmore said the decision was made
  without proper consultation with students and staff, who were yet to receive
  clarification on exactly which courses were moving to online lectures. A
  spokesperson for Adelaide University said the institution was not removing
  face-to-face lectures, as it had clarified last year. They said more than
  3,000 students, academics and “teaching innovation experts” had been engaged
  to design the university’s curriculum and courses. “Our students deserve
  dynamic, collaborative and supportive learning environments and the university
  will offer both on-campus and online lectures to enable the best mode of
  delivery, which will vary by course and discipline,” they said. “To support
  enrolments and to ensure a successful transition to Adelaide University,
  individual study plans are being provided. They will outline the student’s new
  Adelaide University program, previously completed courses and credit, and the
  remaining courses needed to complete their degree.” Before the sit-in, about
  550 people had signed a petition by Save Our Lectures calling for no axing of
  face-to-face classes. Emily, a first year student and signatory, said video
  lectures created a “lack of connection” to subjects and the teacher. “I do so
  much better in subjects with face-to-face lectures. I think I will leave
  [Adelaide University] for Flinders University if this happens,” she said.
  James, another signatory, said “the only thing that makes the information we
  learn from university any different from what we can gather online by
  ourselves is the in-person lectures performed by actual professors in our
  fields of study”. “Removing lectures would be a travesty,” he said. Adelaide
  University is not alone. In 2020, Curtin University and Murdoch University
  released plans to move away from face-to-face lectures, even after the
  pandemic. The next year, the University of the Sunshine Coast did the same,
  citing a “gradual shift” from the number of students wanting to attend
  lectures, as did the University of Tasmania. More than 900 degrees across
  about 30 Australian universities can now be attained entirely online,
  according to Open Universities Australia, which partners with tertiary
  institutions to make higher education more accessible.
