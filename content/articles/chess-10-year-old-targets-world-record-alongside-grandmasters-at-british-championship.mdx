  England’s grandmasters are in action on Saturday, as round one of the British
  Championship gets under way at St George’s Hall in the centre of Liverpool.
  Former Russian Nikita Vitiugov, 38, the national No 1, is top seeded while the
  No 3 and world senior champion, Michael Adams, is the man in form after the
  53-year-old from Taunton, Somerset, won the English title in July. The
  continuing chess boom, reflecting the easy availability of online blitz games,
  the popularity of the world No 1, Magnus Carlsen, and the success of Netflix’s
  The Queen’s Gambit, have combined to spark a record entry of over 1,600
  players for the championship and its subsidiary tournaments. Vitiugov, who
  switched federations in response to the invasion of Ukraine, and Adams, who
  defies the years and was impressive when winning the English title at
  Kenilworth, can expect several challenges to appear during the nine-round
  tournament, which finishes on Sunday week. Gawain Jones, 37, is the defending
  champion and No 3 seed. Matthew Wadsworth, 25, and England’s youngest ever
  grandmaster Shreyas Royal, 16, are ambitious for new achievements while Dan
  Fernandez, 27, is fresh from an impressive first place in the Ghent Open.
  Bodhana Sivanandan, the 10-year-old Harrow primary schoolgirl who is already
  in the record books, scored another landmark result last Sunday when she
  achieved a Fide women’s grandmaster performance with 4.5/9 at the
  Aix-en-Provence tournament in France. In doing so, Sivanandan broke a historic
  age record set by Judit Polgar, the all-time women’s No 1, in London 1988 at
  age 12, and then broken by Hou Yifan, China’s all-time women’s No 2, as an
  11-year-old at the Beijing Fide zonal in 2005. Sivanandan met a strong field,
  including a grandmaster and five international masters. Her fast, confident,
  accurate and impressive defence in a tricky pawn down rook endgame against
  2488-rated GM Ortik Nigmatov of Uzbekistan was captured on video by ChessBase
  India. Her overall performance rating for the event was 2401, providing her
  first woman grandmaster norm and her second of three required norms for woman
  international master. Her overall Fide rating leapt from 2087 to 2216, her
  highest yet. The age record for a national championship was set in July 2024
  by a 10-year-old, Abdalrahman Sameh Mohamed, who totalled 10.5/11 with a
  rating performance of 2466 in the Egyptian championship in Cairo. For the UK,
  the record holder is Akshaya Kalaiyalahan, who won the first of her two
  British women’s titles in 2013, aged 11. Sivanandan’s latest result suggests
  that she has made a big quantum jump, as many talented juniors do. She
  currently has momentum on her side. In such circumstances, extraordinary
  results become possible. The women’s championship at Liverpool is incorporated
  within the open event, and on the face of it, winning the title this year
  could be a bridge too far for Sivanandan. In round one of the British
  Championship on Saturday she has been paired with Jones. Her fellow prodigy
  Supratit Banerjee, 11, will play Vitiugov. The three clear favourites are the
  former world girls champion Harriet Hunt, the English woman champion, Elmira
  Mirzoeva, and the defending co-champion Lan Yao, who is fresh from a major
  success at the Andorra Open, where she achieved her third and final norm for
  the IM title, although she still needs a 2400 rating for that against her
  current high of Fide 2382. This was Yao’s winning final round game, which
  clinched her final norm. She was unbeaten in the Andorra Open against six IMs
  and a GM. Last Sunday, the same day that Sivanandan and Yao reached their
  norms, Jonathan Pein, 27, son of the ECF International Director and CHESS
  magazine editor, Malcolm Pein, made his first IM norm in Oviedo, Spain,
  sharing third prize with seven wins, two losses, and no draws. Chess made its
  first appearance this week at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
  with a huge $1.5m prize fund. The quarter-finals and semi-finals were both
  played on Thursday. One game provided an early disaster, as Nodirbek
  Abdusattorov v Jan-Krzysztof Duda lasted only five moves due to a mouse slip:
  1 e4 e5 2 Nf3 Nc6 3 Nc3 Nf6 4 Bc4 Nxe4 5 Nxe4 d6?? and Black resigned. Of
  course 5…d5 was intended, when the game is level. In the quarter-finals
  Alireza Firouzja (France) beat Abdusattorov (Uzbekistan) 3-1, Arjun Erigaisi
  (India) beat Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia) 2.5-1.5, Carlsen (Norway) beat Nihal
  Sarin (India) 2.5-0.5, and Hikaru Nakamura (US) beat Levon Aronian (US)
  2.5-1.5. In the semi-finals Firouzja beat Erigaisi 4-1 and Carlsen beat
  Nakamura 4-3. In the final on Friday Carlsen defeated Firouzja in the best of
  three sets by 2-0 (3-1, 3-1). In the third place match, Nakamura defeated
  Erigaisi 3.5-2.5. 3983 1 g4+! fxg4 (if Kh4 2 Bg3 mate) 2 Rd5+! Ne5 3 Rxe5+
  Qxe5 4 Qxh6 mate.
