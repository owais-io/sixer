  Here’s a sentence I never thought I’d write: Marjorie Taylor Greene, a
  far-right conspiracy theorist and bigot who also happens to be a Republican
  congresswoman, has suddenly started to speak (a small amount of) sense. It’s
  unclear what exactly precipitated it, but the Georgia congresswoman has
  declared war on her fellow Republicans. “The course that [the Republican
  party] is on, I don’t want to have anything to do with it,” Greene told the
  Daily Mail last week. Greene went on to complain that her male colleagues
  treat their female peers badly, referencing the Trump administration pulling
  Elise Stefanik’s nomination for United Nations ambassador in favor of Mike
  Waltz. To refresh your memory, just a couple of months before getting
  confirmed as US ambassador to the UN, Waltz was ousted as national security
  adviser after it was revealed he had mistakenly added a journalist to a
  private Signal chat used to discuss strikes in Yemen. Weird how some people –
  and by “people” I mean well-connected white men – have a way of always failing
  up. “[Stefanik] got screwed by the White House,” Greene told the Mail. “I
  think there’s other women in our party that are really sick and tired of the
  way men treat Republican women.” Which is interesting wording: Greene doesn’t
  seem to care about how Republican men treat women in general, just the ones in
  the party. Still, baby steps and all that. It’s certainly amusing to see
  Greene suddenly have a revelation that a party led by a legally defined sexual
  predator may have some disturbing views about women. Greene seems to be having
  a lot of revelations lately: she recently became the first Republican lawmaker
  to say that there is a genocide happening in Gaza. She also criticized the
  Florida representative Randy Fine for dismissing a report about Israel’s
  forced starvation in Gaza as propaganda and writing “starve away” on social
  media. Fine, by the way, has previously said Gaza should be nuked and posted
  that Palestinians are “demons that live on Earth … they only deserve death.”
  There’s always very little outrage from lawmakers, or media coverage, about
  his hateful remarks because anti-Palestinian racism is a bipartisan position
  in the US. To be clear, I don’t think Greene’s comments about Gaza have
  anything to do with empathy for Palestinians. Unfortunately, I also don’t
  think her comments were prompted by an analysis of the growing consensus from
  respected experts that a genocide is under way. Rather, it’s more likely that
  Greene, a Christian nationalist who has a history of promoting Islamophobic
  and antisemitic conspiracy theories, is motivated by antisemitic impulses
  here. Let me be unequivocal about this: while she may occasionally be making
  more sense recently, Greene is no friend to the Palestinian cause specifically
  or progressive issues more generally. Nevertheless, it’s still fun to watch
  the congresswoman sow discord in the Republican party by calling for a release
  of the Epstein files, criticizing US strikes in Iran and denouncing Fox News.
  On Wednesday, for example, she took aim at the Fox News personality Mark
  Levin, who called the congresswoman a “lunatic”, by calling Fox News
  irrelevant. “[M]ost of the people that watch Fox News are very much up in age,
  the baby boomer generation, who I love … but that’s their biggest audience.
  That’s not the future of America,” the congresswoman said. That statement
  echoes comments she made to the former Florida Republican lawmaker Matt Gaetz
  in June, when she called Fox News and the New York Post “propaganda” and
  “neocon network news”. In that same conversation she said: “We have propaganda
  news on our side, just like the left does, and the American people have been
  brainwashed into believing that America has to engage in these foreign wars in
  order for us to survive, and it’s absolutely not true.” Keep going, Marjorie!
  While I can’t stress enough that MTG is no ally, that doesn’t mean she’s not
  an accidental asset when it comes to destroying the Republican party. I’ve
  lost any hope that the Democrats, a party that largely consists of
  self-interested careerists who don’t believe in much other than their own
  advancement and are happy to help fund a genocide, will mount any sort of
  meaningful fight against the worst instincts of Trumpism. When Maga eventually
  collapses it will be from infighting, not Democratic opposition. Trump names
  registered sex offender to lead children’s sports initiative Lawrence Taylor,
  a former New York Giants linebacker and registered sex offender has been
  appointed to a council that will advise on matters including youth sports. I
  can’t wait to hear from all the anti-trans “feminist” writers who declared
  Trump a “feminist hero” and “feminist icon” after he used an executive order
  to “protect” women by ensuring trans women couldn’t compete in women’s sports.
  Why are people throwing sex toys at US women’s basketball games? “The dildo is
  a weaponized farce,” writes Lee Escobedo in the Guardian. “It’s thrown not
  just to interrupt but to dominate the narrative, to remind players that their
  gender, their careers and their stage remain vulnerable to mockery.” Sexism
  and misogyny drive record levels of abuse at English football games It’s not
  just basketball that has a major misogyny problem. I regret to inform you that
  there is ‘breast milk ice cream’ now And of course it’s going viral. Women
  shouldn’t hold office, says Republican woman running for office Arizona state
  senate hopeful Mylie Biggs, the daughter of Republican representative Andy
  Biggs, told a podcast last year that she wouldn’t “vote for any female [and] I
  don’t know if females should be in office”. Musk’s Grok generates fake Taylor
  Swift nudes when you put it on ‘spicy’ mode Musk once offered to impregnate
  Swift. Not exactly surprising that his company’s chatbot, which has also
  praised Hitler in the past, would digitally undress her. Gates Foundation
  pledges $2.5bn to women’s health initiatives According to Bill Gates, his
  foundation is now the primary funder when it comes to researching the vaginal
  microbiome. It would be nice if we didn’t have to depend on the largesse of
  billionaires for women’s health funding. Report reveals abuse of pregnant
  women and children at US Ice facilities Yet more evidence that the “pro-life”
  crowd, who have little to say about this, are not “pro-life” they are simply
  pro forced birth. What is the real death toll in Gaza? In a column this week,
  I argued the 60,000 figure is a major undercount. Responding to my column,
  Rachel Taylor, executive director of Every Casualty Counts, an international
  NGO that works to document casualties of armed violence, pointed out the
  following: “The Gaza population register is managed by the Israeli ministry of
  interior – they certify all births and deaths in Gaza. The Israeli authorities
  could immediately dispel all doubts about the number of deaths in Gaza by
  releasing the registered fatality figures from the past two years. But they
  choose not to. Why?” Sandra Domínguez fought against femicide in Mexico, then
  became a victim herself Domínguez and her husband were found dead earlier this
  year and, while it’s not clear who killed them, her family believe her murder
  was tied to her feminist activism in Oaxaca. “Oaxaca is the most dangerous
  state in Mexico for activists,” the Guardian writes in a piece about
  Domínguez. “Since 2018, 58 people have been murdered and six more are
  missing.” Meta illegally collected data from period and pregnancy app, jury
  finds I know, I know: hard to believe that Meta would be doing something dodgy
  with people’s sensitive data. A real shocker. The week in pawtriarchy It’s
  been another unbearable news week, so please enjoy this paw-late cleanser of a
  tiny Pomeranian called Scout chasing a large bear out of its house. Scout may
  only be six pounds but it’s clear who is top dog.
