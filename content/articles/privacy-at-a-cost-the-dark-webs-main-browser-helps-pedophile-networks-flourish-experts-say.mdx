  Millions of child predators are forming sprawling online communities on the
  dark web using the Tor network, where criminal behavior escalates through the
  sharing of child sexual abuse material, grooming strategies and normalization
  of exploitation, experts say. Despite repeated warnings of a growing number of
  predators taking advantage of it, Tor’s developers have taken no action to
  curb the spread of this content, critics say. The Tor (“the onion router”)
  network is an anonymity-focused internet system that routes traffic through a
  global web of volunteer-run servers to obscure users’ identities and
  locations. By encrypting data in multiple layers – like that of an onion – Tor
  makes digital activity difficult to trace. This privacy architecture, experts
  warn, has created a safe haven for child predators. The platform’s design
  makes it virtually impossible to remove harmful posts or illegal content, they
  say, and the organization behind Tor has resisted pressure to implement even
  basic safeguards. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P) told the
  Guardian it had submitted more than 19,000 notifications to the Tor Project –
  the privacy-focused US non-profit that develops and maintains the network –
  flagging child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detected on its system. Yet the
  organization has taken no action, according to C3P. “Tor is designed in a way
  such that they can’t remove anything and they refuse to change it, because the
  idea of any sort of censorship on there is bad,” said Lloyd Richardson, C3P’s
  director of technology. “Tor has a board of directors that makes decisions
  surrounding this, and I don’t think they’ve ever been held to account for any
  of this. They’re the only people who can essentially intervene, and they
  refuse to do so.” The Tor Project offers two primary tools designed to enhance
  online anonymity. The first is the Tor browser, which routes internet traffic
  on the regular web through a network of volunteer-run servers, effectively
  masking a user’s location and activity. This process functions similarly to a
  virtual private network by concealing identifying information. The second, the
  onion services (formerly known as hidden services), are websites or services
  hosted within the Tor network, accessible only via .onion addresses. These
  provide both user and server anonymity. Onion services websites operate
  exclusively within the Tor network. Their specialized .onion domain allows
  them to remain concealed from traditional search engines and standard internet
  access. Neither of Tor’s products has systems to detect, moderate or report
  CSAM, or mechanisms for processing user-generated content in the way
  mainstream social networks do. To connect to a hidden service, both the user
  and the service create separate encrypted paths that meet at a randomly
  selected rendezvous point. This process involves at least three relays or
  “nodes” operated by anonymous volunteer entities and individuals around the
  world, keeping both IP addresses hidden from each other, and makes it
  exceptionally difficult to trace the user’s activity or location. More users
  find their way to the dark web While using Tor onion services requires more
  technical expertise than the regular web, recent advancements in its usability
  are driving an increase in the number of predators active there by lowering
  the barrier of entry, said experts interviewed. Mainstream social media
  platforms like Reddit, Telegram and Discord have become informal entry points
  to the dark web, playing a central role in guiding users on to the Tor
  network. These platforms host discussions about accessing Tor, which include
  step-by-step guides, marketplace directories, safety tips and .onion links to
  illicit content. Now, individuals are often introduced to Tor through social
  media chats that promise more extreme or explicit content, lowering the
  barrier to entry for child predators and other offenders, said a federal
  prosecutor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “I’ve had cases where
  people have started on traditional social media platforms and someone will say
  to them something along the lines of: ‘If you want to see my real stuff,
  here’s a link to my thing,’” said the prosecutor. “That is often how that
  happens and how you get people getting on the dark web or accessing things
  that they don’t traditionally have access to or wouldn’t access without
  prompting.” Child predators are drawn to using Tor because they do not need to
  conceal their activities, already being afforded anonymity by the browser,
  said Dan Sexton, chief technology officer at the Internet Watch Foundation, a
  UK-based non-profit that focuses on preventing online child abuse. “They know
  that there are law enforcement and other people monitoring these sites,” said
  Sexton. “Yet they just do it in plain sight because the anonymity gives them
  that level of protection, and that feeling like they can’t be found, they
  can’t be caught, so it’s low risk in that respect.” The predators active in
  these forums form welcoming communities on Tor’s network, where they
  compliment and encourage one another in a way that they don’t do elsewhere
  online, experts say. The Guardian has reviewed excerpts of discussion threads
  in which users share tips on how to target, groom and abuse very young
  children. These dark web forums, accessed via Tor, are estimated to have
  hundreds of thousands of users by C3P. These excerpts were uncovered this year
  by investigators at the C3P and shared with law enforcement. The material was
  redacted to remove any information that could identify a victim before it was
  passed to the Guardian. According to experts, these anonymous communities
  normalise child abuse, making it more likely that participants will go on to
  commit contact offenses against children they can access in real life. “People
  will say ‘this particular victim is what has made me want to violate my own
  daughter’ and things like that,” said Richardson of C3P. “There’s definitely,
  by their own admission, this sort of escalation, and they egg each other on in
  these communities.” A study published by Nature last year determined that CSAM
  is easily available using 21 out of the 26 most-used Tor search engines, and
  that at least 11% of users’ searches seek CSAM. Research published in the
  Journal of Online Trust and Safety indicates that more than 40% of dark web
  users accessing CSAM go on to seek contact with children with the aim of
  pursuing sexual acts. A spokesperson for the Tor Project said in a statement
  it was “deeply troubled by the fact that a small fraction of internet users
  exploit Tor for illicit purposes, and we strongly condemn the misuse of Tor
  technology for any illicit use cases, especially child sexual abuse material
  (CSAM). As an organization dedicated to advancing human rights and
  strengthening online privacy protections, we recognize the legitimate concerns
  raised by child protection organizations and experts.” The Tor Project
  receives funding from a number of backers including the US Department of
  State, the Swedish government’s international development agency (Sida), the
  Open Society Foundations, Craig Newmark Philanthropies, the Ford Foundation
  and Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s philanthropic initiative #StartSmall. Tor’s
  services have long served as an important tool for protecting online
  anonymity, enabling free expression and access to information under repressive
  regimes. Amnesty International has recognized Tor’s contribution to advancing
  human rights by shielding users from unlawful surveillance and censorship. The
  ACLU has similarly advocated for its use, urging government websites to inform
  users of anonymous browsing options, particularly for reporting sensitive
  information. Tor’s anonymity protections have been crucial for whistleblowers
  and dissidents. Edward Snowden used Tails, an operating system that routes
  traffic through Tor, to leak NSA documents anonymously in 2013. During Iran’s
  2009 protests, activists relied on Tor to bypass state censorship and
  coordinate securely with the outside world. The Guardian has also made a
  version of its website available to Tor users as an onion service. However,
  critics argue that Tor’s benefits should not come at the cost of enabling the
  distribution of CSAM. “Trading content of children being sexually abused is
  not protected free expression. It’s a felony,” said Gretchen Peters, founder
  and executive director of the Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO), a
  non-profit focused on combating serious online crimes. “Why are US government
  organizations like the state department continuing to fund the Tor Project,
  while this problem continues to be so severe?” The US state department did not
  respond to comment requests. A spokesperson for the Tor Project told the
  Guardian that introducing mechanisms to monitor or block content on Tor would
  undermine privacy and security protections that millions of legitimate users
  rely upon. “Tor is not creating the bad sites – it’s creating the unregulated
  superhighway that people traverse. It’s willful blindness,” said the
  prosecutor interviewed. “Child sexual abuse material makes up a significant
  portion of content hosted on dark web sites.” The Tor Project is not legally
  obligated to report CSAM to authorities, unlike US-based electronic service
  providers (ESPs) such as social media companies, which must report any
  detected or apparent CSAM to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited
  Children (NCMEC), which evaluates the reports and forwards them to law
  enforcement. Tor is not considered an ESP since it is engineered for privacy
  and anonymity, routing internet traffic to conceal user identities rather than
  hosting or moderating content. These sites operate entirely within the network
  using .onion addresses. Yet, well-intentioned volunteer node operators may
  unknowingly contribute to the transmission of harmful content, including the
  circulation of CSAM and the operation of pedophile networks, experts said.
  “People who join the Tor network have no opportunity to opt out of the CSAM
  trade. You support all of Tor when you become a relay or none of it,” said
  Brian Levine, associate dean of IT and facilities and distinguished professor
  at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Tor is also not impenetrable to other
  forms of hacking: the FBI has deployed malware to infiltrate child abuse
  images sites hosted by Tor, which has uncovered thousands of real IP addresses
  of users visiting the sites. Millions of pedophiles Law enforcement agencies
  around the world have undertaken several high-profile takedowns of large
  pedophile forums that have revealed the potential scale and organization of
  these networks. Kidflix, one of the largest-known paedophile sites in the
  world, was dismantled by international law enforcement earlier this year in an
  operation involving authorities from more than 35 countries. The platform,
  which was hosted on Tor, had attracted 1.8 million users globally between
  April 2022 and March 2025, according to German law enforcement. On 11 March
  2025, German and Dutch authorities seized the server, which at the time held
  approximately 72,000 CSAM videos. Another platform on Tor named Childs Play,
  boasted a million users when it was in operation between 2016 and 2017,
  Australian police said after their sting operation brought it down. Shutting
  one site down rarely ends the problem, as predators can easily migrate to
  another site on the service, experts say. C3P actively monitors and scrapes
  information from several pedophile sites on Tor, and the larger sites have
  estimated user bases of between 300,000 and 600,000 each, said Richardson.
  “It’s created this system where law enforcement takes something down,” said
  Levine. “It all gets rebuilt back up by a single person who may get caught in
  the future, but there’s always more of these individuals lining up to start up
  the next forum that’s carrying the knowledge forward.” The experts interviewed
  urged Tor to act to remove CSAM from its sites and stem the formation of
  pedophile groups. “The notion that just because the web addresses aren’t
  searchable by the surface web doesn’t mean that the administrators of Tor
  can’t find wrongdoing that is going on in their systems and remove it and
  report it to authorities,” said Peters, of ACCO. The concern, experts warn, is
  that while the technique can clearly be applied to illegal material, there is
  no easy way to draw the line that prevents it from being used more broadly.
  “Some kind of content moderation is needed. We just haven’t yet figured out
  how to do it in a way that is scalable,” said Juha Nurmi, cybersecurity expert
  and postdoctoral research fellow at Tampere University in Finland. “It could
  be done so multiple parties need to use their private keys to make filtering
  decisions for a certain website, and these are across multiple countries. It
  could be a way to handle it so we don’t have a central power making
  decisions.” A spokesperson for the Tor Project said: “The Tor Project
  collaborates with organizations dedicated to combating the tech-enabled
  distribution of CSAM by leveraging Tor technology to reach individuals
  struggling with harmful behaviors and offering them pathways to treatment
  through private, secure channels.” C3P said its data shows that treatment
  programs for pedophiles are an ineffective approach to curbing offender
  behaviour on Tor’s onion services. This is in part because these users aren’t
  part of the pedophile population seeking help. “Our data indicates that these
  forums continue to grow in size, and the trade of CSAM made possible by the
  Tor Project has only increased,” said C3P’s Richardson. In a statement to the
  Guardian, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) said
  its funding of Tor is earmarked for the training and capacity-building of
  human rights defenders, abuse survivors, journalists and reporters in need of
  protection and privacy “Sida is in frequent contact with Tor’s leadership. In
  this specific case, we have also reached out to them to confirm their
  engagement and are following this matter closely,” said a Sida spokesperson.
  Open Society Foundation said it made a grant to Tor to support the ability of
  human rights defenders to maintain secure and confidential communications, and
  the grant has since ended. “We are alarmed to learn of these allegations, and
  we will be conducting a review of this grant,” said a spokesperson for the
  organization. “We always expect our grantees to comply with their legal
  obligations and to uphold human rights principles.” • In the US, call or text
