  ‘I remember looking up over the DJ booth in this huge squat,” says Mario
  Aguero, “and seeing a sea of mattresses with people lying on them, like some
  kind of Guinness record attempt. Which was great until someone stood up to go
  to the bathroom. Then they’d be lurching everywhere.” This was the scene at
  Telepathic Fish in early 90s London, and co-promoter Kevin Foakes winces as he
  picks up the memory. “We’d dragged quite a few of the mattresses off the
  street.” The influential music journalist David Toop had come along, “and his
  report said the first mistake he made was to sit down on a wet mattress”.
  Waterlogged bedding for unwary horizontal punters doesn’t seem to suggest a
  key moment in British music history. But Telepathic Fish’s parties became a
  hub for an entirely new zone of club culture: chillout. The word now evokes
  anonymous music for health spas, interchangeable Ibiza Poolside Chill or
  Relaxing Piano type playlists, or perhaps pranged-out ravers yammering in a
  decidedly un-zen superclub “chillout room”. But a new Telepathic Fish
  compilation, Trawling the Early 90s Ambient Underground, shows how adventurous
  chillout music originally was, and a wave of new events from London to Berlin
  and New York – some complete with duvets and pillows – are keeping Telepathic
  Fish’s spirit and soft furnishing choices alive. Back in 1992 Foakes was at
  Camberwell College of Arts with his friend David Vallade, while Aguero had
  come down from the Madchester-era north and was working at a computer graphics
  company. They were all into the crustier end of rave, such as London
  institution Club Dog and squat raves by Tribal Energy and Digidub, and were
  living together in a three-storey house above a shop “with no neighbours, so
  we thought we’d throw a party,” Vallade says. By their second event, they had
  a name, Telepathic Fish, and more than 300 guests paying £1 to get in (they
  each also got a hand-cut holographic foil fish lanyard). Their near neighbour
  and DJ, Mixmaster Morris, played a chillout room upstairs, stacked with old
  TVs, and the night was a huge hit. “That was our favourite part by a long
  way,” says Aguero. “It was social, fun, weird, and the music could go
  absolutely anywhere.” By their next party, in mid 1993, they had a new
  flatmate, Chantal Passamonte – later the acclaimed producer and sound artist
  Mira Calix. After arriving from South Africa, she’d thrown herself into
  London’s music networks, working in record shops and interning at the label
  4AD. “That is when things really kicked up several gears,” says Foakes. “We
  were just three lads doing a party, but she instantly plugged us into
  something much bigger.” They graduated to a vast squatted former dole office
  in Brixton, and Telepathic Fish became an entirely horizontal event. “We
  jettisoned the dancefloor!” says Aguero. But they realised they needed
  something for people to look at if they weren’t dancing, so they booked Matt
  Black from Coldcut to be a video jockey. “We only had a vague idea what that
  was, and it turned out he’d never done it in public before,” Foakes says. “So
  it was a trial by fire, but he did it, and every party after that.” The
  futurism of Black and Aguero’s graphics met low-tech stencilling, camouflage
  netting and those sometimes moist mattresses, all glowing under UV light for a
  deeply stoned crowd. Foakes says, “The best record buying advice I ever got
  was Morris telling me: if you see an old record with hippies and synthesisers
  on the cover, get it!”, and the room was duly filled with dreamy Detroit
  techno, proto-trip-hop and space-dub woven into film soundtracks, minimalist
  classical and Krautrock. The team cite Oscillate in Birmingham and Sonora in
  Glasgow (run by JD Twitch, later of Optimo) as peers, as well as the chillout
  areas in crusty clubs and free parties. The influence of the Orb and the KLF
  loomed large too; Alex Paterson and Jimmy Cauty were the DJs in the ambient
  room at Paul Oakenfold’s club night Land of Oz. But over a series of squat
  events and then guest spots at clubs and festivals – plus all four of the team
  working at the scene’s hub, record shop Ambient Soho – Telepathic Fish became
  a major focus for the era’s experimentalism. Aphex Twin played there, just as
  Warp Records was cementing him, Autechre and others as left-field superstars.
  The Ninja Tune label which Black had founded with Jonathan More – now,
  alongside Warp, the most important in UK electronic music – found its feet
  partly with Telepathic Fish as a testing ground, and Foakes became both Ninja
  Tune’s in-house designer, as well as releasing records under the name DJ Food.
  Aguero and Vallade would find success in video games and illustration
  respectively. The events ended in 1995, and while chillout rooms cropped up
  across clubland, the concept of an entirely chillout nightclub dissipated. “It
  was always a cottage industry,” says Vallade: the odd squatter selling cans or
  cups of chai on a trestle table notwithstanding, it wasn’t really commercial
  in a way that could hold up against the professionalisation of club culture as
  the 90s wore on. Ambient electronica started getting ever artier and more
  experimental, and trip-hop replaced it as the de facto stoner soundtrack.
  Ibiza had its own parallel chillout tradition thanks to its famous sunset sets
  at Cafe del Mar (plus its mixtape/CD series), where DJ Jose Padilla would play
  Aphex Twin alongside Ennio Morricone and Astrud Gilberto, but gradually
  Balearic chilling became synonymous with pedestrian beats you might hear as
  hold music for a multinational bank. Thirty years on, though, the Telepathic
  Fish compilation emerges amid refreshed interest in cosmic sounds and
  laid-back events. DJ/producer Mark Barrott flies the flag for the original
  Ibizan chillout spirit with blissful sets at Hostal Del Torre, with names very
  much in the Telepathic Fish tradition such as Boards Of Canada and µ-Ziq next
  to Nina Simone and Mazzy Star. Elsewhere, inspired by home gatherings and
  after-hours sessions at London’s Brilliant Corners, with bedding included,
  Errol and Alex Rita of Touching Bass started ambient-leaning listening event A
  Loose Ting: “Making music feel really nice in a small space, a little haven
  for a few hours away from the rest of the world and the madness in it right
  now,” Errol says. Speaking during sets is discouraged at A Loose Ting, just as
  it is at the private loft gatherings of New York’s Planetarium, where the
  audience mainly reclines. Organiser Justin Carter notes with pride the gentle
  rustle of appreciation you can hear at intense moments on recordings of his
  sets. There are no light shows or stencil art, but it does hark back to the
  trippiness of 90s chillout. A big inspiration for Planetarium is the use of
  psychedelic drugs in therapy, Carter says, “This framework where you put on an
  eye mask and you go into this space and you’re encouraged to go deep.”
  Similarly, at Planetarium, “you’re sitting with music that is like a guide or
  a therapist. It’s a quiet experience.” Other events are directly inspired by
  the multimedia madness of 90s chillout. In Berlin, Aoife McGuinness and Jessie
  Dymond Barber set up Overflow, a studio hosting “sensory rave spas” full of
  fountains, harpists, vibrating mattresses and light installations, helping
  clubbers “nurture their bodies”, as Barber puts it. But Overflow is certainly
  not just for reverent sitting and listening, and has a sense of fun and
  mischief: “It’s not only very floaty, beautiful,” says McGuinness, “but brain
  tingly, sideways, weird stuff.” Back in the UK, Wil Troup, founder of label
  and online magazine the Ransom Note, fondly remembers original 90s chillout
  rooms at places such as Brixton’s Fridge; his younger colleague Tia Cousins
  discovered them more recently at the World Unknown parties run by acid house
  survivor Andy Blake. Troup and Cousins’ shared love of ambient sound blossomed
  into their remarkable Music to Watch Seeds Grow By release series, and also
  into the Watching Trees micro-festival they founded with Optimo. Here,
  experimental music and immersive visuals – such as dappled sunlight being
  projected at night – give “a different type of experience” to your average
  rave-up in a field, says Troup. “Like, why do we have this expectation that
  the dancefloor has to go all night? Here people disperse, they talk, it can be
  a beautiful social thing in its own right.” There’s no question the mission of
  Telepathic Fish is alive and well in a space like this – albeit with fewer
  soggy mattresses. • Telepathic Fish – Trawling the Early 90s Ambient
  Underground is released on 5 September on Fundamental Frequencies. The launch
  party is at Arch 555, London, on 31 August
