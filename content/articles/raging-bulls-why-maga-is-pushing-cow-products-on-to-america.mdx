  The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy, claims that beef tallow is a
  healthier alternative to seed oils (even though the American Heart Association
  disagrees). Raw milk advocates are currently criticizing Kennedy, who has
  supported them in the past, to ease restrictions on the sale of their
  preferred dairy product nationwide. Meanwhile, cows have also infiltrated the
  ever trendy skincare market, with beef tallow present in moisturizers, lip
  balm, deodorant and personal lubricant. Though not every beef tallow
  evangelist or raw milk aficionado might consider themselves Republican, cows’
  connection to RFK’s “health” crusade is unavoidable. It appears that cows have
  won the position of Maga’s favorite animal. It’s not exactly a secret that
  Trump loves cows. Last year, when a child called into Fox &amp; Friends to ask
  what his favorite farm animal was. “I’ll tell you what I love, I love cows,
  but if we go with Kamala, you won’t have any cows any more,” he said, adding:
  “I don’t want to ruin this kid’s day.” He made the bizarre talking point a
  part of his campaign stump speeches, telling crowds in North Carolina and
  Nevada that “they want to do things like no more cows.” Now that he’s in
  office, cows remain top of mind – or, at least, their byproducts do. “Woo-woo
  has become moo-moo,” the Atlantic’s Yasmin Tayag wrote this week, in an essay
  about Americans going “all-in” on “cow-based wellness”. “When it comes to
  animal products, it seems [that Maga] promotes cows the most,” said Mark Kern,
  a professor of exercise and nutritional sciences at San Diego State
  University. “They don’t seem to say the same things for chicken or turkey.”
  Pigs could be a close runner-up, as lard, another animal fat, was also used
  regularly in cooking until the early 20th century – a bygone era Maga loves to
  romanticize. It doesn’t hurt that cow mania follows the trend of tradwives
  taking up social media space, extolling the virtues of cooking, cleaning,
  child-rearing and homesteading. If Trump describes cities such as DC, Los
  Angeles and New York as fiery bastions of anarchy, then cows represent
  something entirely different: images of ruddy-cheeked children toting milk
  pails or Sydney Sweeney in a prairie dress. Of course, none of this is the
  fault of cows. “Beef can be a very healthful food when eaten in moderation,”
  Kern said. “I see value in it, but that doesn’t mean we should eat it at the
  expense of seed oils.” The Maha (Make America Healthy Again) crowd’s obsession
  with beef tallow is based on a “misperception” that it is less refined than
  seed oils, Kern explained. “You can’t just get beef tallow from a cow,” he
  said. “You have to render that fat, which is a refining process, too.” Though
  there are no known benefits of consuming beef tallow, some chain restaurants
  such as Steak ’n Shake have switched to using it in the wake of RFK’s
  endorsement. Bart Hutchins is the chef of Butterworth’s, a nouveau French
  restaurant in DC popular with the Maga cohort. Last month, Hutchins told Axios
  that his kitchen goes through 500 beef bones a week serving a roasted marrow
  that is Steve Bannon’s “go-to” order. (Marco Rubio and the Breitbart staff
  apparently love it, too.) Bone marrow contains collagen, a protein that’s long
  been a beauty buzzword associated with reported cosmetic benefits such as
  skin, hair and nail health. It is a common ingredient in pills and powders
  that promise youthful skin, though dermatologists say this has not been
  definitively proven by any studies. That does not stop rich people from loving
  it. “If you describe something ‘with collagen’, it’s poised to move for a
  certain economic class,” Hutchins said. Candice Ray, a 24-year-old dietician
  student who splits her time between Canada and Vermont, liked beef tallow
  before it was taken on as a Maha status symbol. She has slathered it on her
  face every night for two years, swearing it transformed her rough, bumpy
  complexion into a clear, clean glow. “It’s done wonders for me,” Ray said. “My
  skin just looks more healthy.” To be fair, Ray – an influencer who shares
  “nontoxic living” tips to her following of nearly 350,000 on Instagram –
  adheres to other medically dubious practices such as not washing her face. You
  might assume that if you cover your face in beef tallow and go to bed without
  washing it off, you will end up reeking of barnyard musk. Ray disagrees. “I
  find it smells just slightly earthy,” she says. Ray is not exactly thrilled
  that Maga has taken up the cause of advancing beef tallow. “My choice to use
  it is not political whatsoever,” she said. “But when I tell people that I use
  beef tallow, they kind of look at me like, ‘Oh, you’re a natural-living
  girly.’” • This article was amended on 20 August 2025. Sweetgreen replaced
  seed oil in their restaurants with avocado and extra virgin olive oil, not
  beef tallow as an earlier version said. This has now been removed.
