  Seen from the air, Gaza looks like the ruins of an ancient civilisation,
  brought to light after centuries of darkness. A patchwork of concrete shapes
  and shattered walls, neighbourhoods scattered with craters, rubble and roads
  that lead nowhere. The remnants of cities wiped out. But here, there has been
  no natural disaster and no slow passage of time. Gaza was a bustling, living
  place until less than two years ago, for all the challenges its residents
  endured even then. Its markets were crowded, its streets were full of
  children. That Gaza is gone – not buried under volcanic ash, not erased by
  history, but razed by an Israeli military campaign that has left behind a
  place that looks like the aftermath of an apocalypse. Members of Jordan’s
  military stand among pallets of aid about to be dropped on Gaza The Guardian
  was granted permission on Tuesday to travel onboard a Jordanian military
  aircraft providing aid. Israel announced last week that it had resumed
  coordinated humanitarian airdrops over Gaza, following mounting international
  pressure over severe shortages of food and medical supplies, which has reached
  such a crisis point that a famine is now unfolding there. The flight offered
  not only a chance to witness three tonnes of aid – far from sufficient –
  dropped over the famine-stricken strip but also a rare opportunity to observe,
  albeit from above, a territory that has been largely sealed off from the
  international media since 7 October and the subsequent offensive launched by
  Israel. Following the Hamas-led attacks that day, Israel barred foreign
  journalists from entering Gaza – an unprecedented move in the history of
  modern conflict, marking one of the rare moments that reporters have been
  denied access to an active war zone. Gaza Strip from the aid plane; view of
  northern Gaza; the distortion in the last picture is due to the heat emitted
  by the aircraft engines Even from an altitude of about 2,000ft (600 metres),
  it was possible to glimpse places that mark some of the conflict’s most
  devastating chapters – a landscape etched with the scars of its deadliest
  attacks. These are the sites of bombings and sieges that have been
  courageously documented by Palestinian journalists – often at the cost of
  their own lives. More than 230 Palestinian reporters lie buried beneath in
  hastily dug cemeteries. Airdrops released from the plane About an hour and a
  half after takeoff, the plane flies over the ruins of northern Gaza and Gaza
  City, now a wasteland of crumbling concrete and dust. Buildings are reduced to
  rubble, roadways pitted with craters, entire neighbourhoods flattened. From
  this distance it is nearly impossible to see Gaza’s inhabitants. Only through
  a nearly-400mm camera lens is it possible to make out a small group of people
  standing among the ruins of a shattered landscape – the only sign of life in a
  place that appears otherwise uninhabitable. As the aircraft approaches the
  Nuseirat refugee camp, the rear hatch opens and pallets of aid slide out,
  parachutes blooming behind as they fall toward the ground. “With today’s
  airdrops, the Jordan Armed Forces-Arab Army has now conducted 140 airdrop
  operations, in addition to 293 in cooperation with other countries, delivering
  325 tonnes of aid to Gaza since the resumption of airdrops on 27 July,” a note
  from the Jordanian military reads. Yet such quantities are nowhere close to
  being enough. Humanitarian agencies warn that hunger is spreading rapidly
  through the territory. While airdrops can create the perception that something
  is being done, they are, by common consensus, costly, inefficient and do not
  get anywhere near to the amount of aid that could be delivered by lorries. In
  the first 21 months of war, 104 days of airdrops supplied the equivalent of
  just four days of food for Gaza, Israeli data shows. They can also be deadly;
  at least 12 people drowned last year trying to recover food that landed in the
  sea, and at least five were killed when pallets fell on them. Farther south,
  the plane passes over Deir al-Balah, in central Gaza. There, in the Baraka
  area below, on 22 May, 11-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, known as Gaza’s youngest
  social media influencer, was killed after a series of heavy Israeli airstrikes
  hit her house while she watered flowers in a tiny patch of greenery eked out
  of a displacement camp. Pallets parachute down after being dropped from a
  military plane over Nuseirat A couple of kilometres further, the aircraft
  flies near Khan Younis, besieged for months by Israeli forces amid fierce
  fighting in and around its hospitals. Somewhere in the northern suburbs are
  the remains of the home of Dr Alaa al-Najjar, a Palestinian paediatrician who
  worked at al-Tahrir hospital, part of the Nasser medical complex. Her house
  was bombed in May while she was on shift. Her husband and nine of her 10
  children were killed in the attack. From the skies, it is striking just how
  small Gaza is – a sliver of land that has become the stage for one of the
  world’s bloodiest conflicts. The territory is more than four times smaller
  than Greater London. In this tiny corner of the Middle East, more than 60,000
  people have been killed in Israeli strikes, according to health authorities.
  Thousands more are estimated to remain buried under the rubble. A few hundred
  metres beneath us, the Guardian reporter Malak A Tantesh, a journalist and a
  survivor, works on one of her dispatches. Most of her fellow reporters,
  editors and other colleagues are yet to meet Tantesh, owing to the Israeli
  blockade that makes it impossible for Gaza’s people to leave. She has been
  displaced multiple times, lives without reliable access to food or water, and
  has lost relatives, friends and her home in the fighting. It is a strange and
  haunting feeling to receive a message from her as the Jordanian aircraft flies
  above. As our aircraft turns back toward Jordan, a soldier onboard points
  toward the hazy horizon to the south. “That’s Rafah down there,” he says.
  Gaza’s southernmost area, Rafah is a region now largely destroyed, where
  hundreds have died in the scramble for food since the Israeli- and US-backed
  Gaza Humanitarian Foundation took over food deliveries in May. Just a few
  kilometres to the east, amid crater-pocked hills, lies the site where, on 23
  March, an Israeli military unit struck a convoy of Palestinian emergency
  vehicles, killing 15 medics and rescue workers who were later buried in a mass
  grave. After touching down at Jordan’s King Abdullah II airbase in Ghabawi,
  the same question seems to linger among the handful of reporters who boarded
  the flight: when will we see Gaza again? And after seeing this desert of
  shattered stones and graves, what more can be destroyed when so much has
  already been lost? Palestinians rush to collect humanitarian aid airdropped by
  the United Arab Emirates into Deir al-Balah
