  She had green eyes that “could see through walls”, Chris remembers, not
  unruefully. When he and his Russian girlfriend broke up, Chris, originally
  from Sussex and now living in Maine in the US, admits he had Siberia (Elena
  came from the city of Novosibirsk) on the mind. He did the obvious thing: went
  and got a pair of three-month-old Siberian husky puppies: Loki and Freja,
  brother and sister – also with piercing eyes, but icy blue, especially Loki’s.
  “People would just stop on the street as he walked by.” Chris had owned dogs
  before– labradors. “I figured that huskies were labradors with fur coats on,”
  he says, talking to me from his pickup truck after an early morning paddle in
  his kayak. “They absolutely are not.” The dogs got bigger, and wilder. “I was
  completely ill-equipped to train them as the role of dominant alpha doesn’t
  come naturally to me. They didn’t seem to want to reason with me. Despite four
  hours of walking a day, it wasn’t enough.” Chris even bought a sled for them,
  because huskies are bred to pull. (Take note of the sled – it will come back
  later in this story.) But the dogs frequently escaped, killing chickens and
  chasing horses. “Twice they were brought home in the back of a police car.
  They ate my ex-girlfriend’s furniture and bit through electrical and internet
  cables. I had to duct-tape the fridge closed, because they could open it with
  their noses. The final straw was when Freja started ripping the plasterboard
  off the wall.” Now everyone could see through walls. “I returned them to the
  breeder and wept in her arms,” Chris remembers. “But she did tell me that in
  her 25 years of breeding huskies, she had never had two returned in such good
  condition and with such well-kept fur.” A big breakup can often prompt people
  to overhaul their life – whether that’s a new haircut, career change or, say,
  acquiring two strapping great Siberian huskies. Why is such a painful time
  also one of renewal? And when the dust settles, do people look back with
  regret? * * * Joanna Harrison, a couples counsellor, former divorce lawyer and
  author of Five Arguments All Couples (Need To) Have and Why The Washing-Up
  Matters, understands this better than most. As well as all the big stuff –
  children, houses, money etc – it’s often the everyday things that people miss
  after a split. “The quietness at home, not being able to talk about the little
  things – people feel alone, miss company. Getting a pet may be a way not to
  feel so alone again. And to have a new project, a new identity. Animals are a
  key part of people’s identity; the animal we choose might reflect an aspect of
  our identity that we’re trying to convey.” Chris just chose the wrong animal.
  Times two. Harrison says divorce or separation can have a profound effect on a
  person mentally. There’s the pain, for starters. “For some, there may also be
  relief, but there’s still something that needs mourning – the relationship,
  the hopes and dreams that are no longer possible.” Of course, the pain will be
  much greater if you didn’t want the relationship to end. “There are all these
  different phases we know about: of grief, feelings of anger, shock,” she says.
  “I work with people who are devastated by the end of a relationship, don’t
  know which way is up or down. They feel disoriented, lost, broken, numb.” Numb
  is what Victoria, in Switzerland, felt when her long-term partner unexpectedly
  walked out. “I doubted myself and everything. I was in shock, not able to feel
  anything – no anger, no pain, nothing,” she tells me. “How could anyone feel
  so numb? Was I really dead inside? I decided to put it to the test, put myself
  into a situation I knew would provoke strong emotions to see if I would still
  be indifferent to life. My solution? Do something that had been on my bucket
  list for a long time – skydiving.” And so she found herself in an aeroplane,
  strapped to an instructor, looking out at the mountains, but still not
  registering any emotions. It all changed on hearing the instruction to open
  the door and thinking: hang on, we’re on a plane, the door shouldn’t be open.
  After watching two other pairs jump and disappear it was Victoria’s turn. “I
  was on the edge; I closed my eyes and let myself go. The adrenaline rush was
  something I’ve never felt in my life. I felt fireworks in my brain.
  Freefalling hundreds of metres above ground, I was happy, I was free. I took
  in the beautiful day, the wonderful landscape, my audacity to put myself
  through all that, the fact I was not only alive but ecstatic.” After landing
  safely, Victoria had a grin so big it began to hurt. “I wrote immediately in
  my journal a note to myself: ‘This period is not going to be easy, and it will
  take time to feel like yourself again, but life is much more than this
  episode. You will heal and you will laugh and love again.’ It took years to
  fully get over my heartbreak but, as I promised myself, I went back to who I
  was, eventually. Since then, I always share with anyone going through a
  heartbreak: have you considered skydiving?” Or indeed backpacking? When
  Rachel’s relationship of seven years came to an abrupt end, she found herself
  in a rut. “I phoned my boss, gave my notice and began to plan,” she tells me.
  “A couple of months later, I flew out of the UK for a solo round-the-world
  backpacking trip, at the ripe old age of 38. The following two years, I
  backpacked through Asia and Australia, then visited 30 US states in a beat-up
  old camper van. I gained a whole new view of the world, met a wonderful girl
  and emigrated to Germany to start a new life.” Harrison says that in virtually
  every relationship there are things you might like to do but, “because of your
  dynamic, what works in your relationship, they don’t happen”. It might be
  intolerable, because you can’t properly express yourself, and it could
  contribute to a relationship ending. Or it could be something to do after the
  relationship ends – set off round the world with a pack on your back. A
  geographical move, a change of scene, is something that cropped up a lot among
  the people I spoke to. After her breakup, Deepa travelled from the US to
  Europe and immediately fell in love all over again: with Prague, where she
  signed up for an English teaching course. Now back in the US, she admits: “We
  are sort of back together. But I would leave him for Prague and my own dreams
  all over again!” Harrison says the urge to go far away is understandable.
  “Something possibly humiliating has happened, or you feel betrayed; maybe
  everything you see is going to remind you of it. It’s quite human to wish to
  have a bit of space to lick your wounds.” She does have a couple of words of
  warning. “The feelings will follow you. Going to the other side of the world
  isn’t necessarily going to stop you hurting about the loss of your
  relationship. You might get there and feel just as awful.” The old problem
  with any kind of travel is that you tend to bring yourself – and your baggage
  – along, too. * * * Separation might be an opportunity to get unstuck, says
  Harrison. “You can claim some of those things back that you may have let your
  partner do, learn a new skill or do something intrepid, and discover you’re
  more competent in that area than you realised. It’s reclaiming some identity,
  and that could be quite positive and exciting.” When John in Belfast was, in
  his words, “given the old heave-ho” by a girlfriend, he decided to fill the
  empty space in his life, and in his room, with a synthesiser. “I learned the
  notes, a few chords, practised scales – no longer was I going to be
  pigeonholed as a mere boyfriend. I had recovered from the rejection and was
  forging ahead with a brilliant new life and future, quickly on the way to
  becoming the next Jean-Michel Jarre or Dave Greenfield [of the Stranglers] … ”
  But then John met someone else. “She swept me off my feet, leaving the
  instrument to gather dust.” It became a repeated sequence, a loop perhaps, if
  you were looking for a musical analogy. “I found myself with another synth to
  fill the gap, but it, too, found itself in the corner as I hit the dancefloor,
  new girlfriend in hand … until, inevitably, another black-and-white-keyed
  friend with lots of buttons and switches joined the growing army of 1980s
  music technology.” You won’t have seen John on Top of the Pops. “I was never
  single long enough to program or even play them. But by the time I bought a
  house and tied the knot, I had an enviable collection of synthesisers and
  other beats-making hardware. Today, most have gone, but I do occasionally find
  myself browsing vintage synthesiser listings on eBay, to keep the marriage
  sharp … ” Sometimes it’s about a change in physical appearance. I heard about
  lizard tattoos, drastic haircuts and dyes (orange and blue). Han in Korea got
  breast-enlargement surgery after divorce. “But I realised they were too big
  for my lifestyle, so I downsized two years later. Since then, I have promised
  myself not to make important decisions after a breakup.” Weight loss came up.
  Significantly, in the case of Christian in California, who dropped 100lb
  (45kg). “After 15 years married to a narcissist, I was 315lb and very
  unhealthy. I wasn’t always like that, but people in toxic relationships often
  end up not taking care of themselves and gaining weight.” Christian joined his
  healthcare provider’s supervised weight-loss programme and was able to lose
  that weight over about eight months. “The road is still ongoing, but the
  divorce was definitely drastically needed, not only for my happiness, but also
  for my health.” It wasn’t the only change Christian made. “I threw away my
  wardrobe of mostly black clothing and started wearing colours again. I wish I
  had done it sooner.” Rhyannon in Gloucestershire transformed her health –
  physical and mental – through open-water swimming. After ending her unhappy
  marriage, she realised she desperately needed significant change in her life.
  As well as getting a new job, she committed to swimming outdoors throughout
  the winter. “After years of neglecting my body and succumbing to the demands
  of work and family obligations, I stumbled upon the pure exhilarating joy of
  cold-water swimming. It rekindled a long-buried need to indulge in activities
  that spark joy within me. In my late 40s I confronted my fears, including the
  intimidating uncertainties of what lay beneath the surface, and discovered I
  had the ability to swim distances I never thought were possible.” Three years
  after the end of her marriage, Rhyannon swam the length of Windermere – nearly
  11 miles (18km). “Change can feel daunting, yet it’s those moments of stepping
  into the unknown that can uncover the profound joy we deserve.” Harrison says
  that separation means “a shift from thinking about the needs of the
  relationship and more to protecting yourself. There can be a need to go into
  survival mode, and that might go alongside trying to take more care of
  yourself, look after things that maybe you haven’t.” She also warns that
  dealing with a breakup is a long process as well as a stressful one. “And it
  isn’t necessarily linear – you might feel better, then go back to feeling not
  so good.” She thinks that people can make big decisions very quickly “to get
  away from something really painful. My advice is often to slow things down,
  because you can’t really bypass the mourning that needs to be done at the end
  of a significant relationship.” * * * Some of the decisions I heard about
  might have benefited from a bit more time. Lawrence in Manchester had a
  partner who was obsessed with crystals, which he went along with because she
  was fun. He even collected some for her while out walking, including one
  “which I was admittedly rather taken with myself, as it was almost perfectly
  shaped like a neolithic hand axe. Obviously, it wasn’t really a neolithic hand
  axe, I told myself, as cavemen weren’t making axes out of pretty crystals,
  were they …” You see where it’s going, right? After Lawrence was dumped, he
  decided to sell his collection of pseudo-mystical rocks, which he did to a
  “wizard” who only really seemed interested in the hand axe – £60 for the lot.
  The folly of his actions began to emerge on a trip to Lisbon where, in the
  prehistory section of the city museum, Lawrence found a cabinet of crystal
  hand axes. Then, on another trip, to the Scottish Highlands where he had
  originally found his, he learned “it was one of few confirmed sites for hunter
  gatherers in the UK. And that their favourite material to work with was – you
  guessed it – crystal.” Lawrence doesn’t know for sure that it was the real
  neolithic deal, but he has seen on the internet cruder versions selling for
  £4,000-£5,000. “I think it should be in the National Museum of Scotland.” And
  remember Chris in Maine? You could say his purchase of two Siberian huskies to
  replace his one Siberian girlfriend wasn’t the wisest of decisions. But this
  one does at least have a happy(ish) coda. Four years later, clearing out his
  basement, Chris came across the dog sled he’d forgotten about. With no use for
  it, he decided to take it to the breeder he had got the dogs from (and to whom
  he had later returned them). “There were all these huskies running about, some
  loose, others in pens with runs attached. I asked her what happened to Loki
  and Freja. ‘They’re here, over in that pen,’ she said. I stayed where I was,
  she went and opened the door, and out looked this big blond head with bright
  blue eyes – Loki! He took one look at me and came charging, followed by his
  sister. They jumped up, pinned me against the wall with their paws on my
  shoulders, licking me to pieces.” They had a better life now, Chris says – dog
  sledding in northern Maine in the winter, then spending summers on the farm.
  Has he seen them again? Does he visit? “I think that would be too confusing,
  definitely for me.” The Russian ex had quickly found – and married – someone
  else. And what about Chris, what’s his current relationship status? “Single.
  And wary.”
