  Ireland’s foreign ministry has called on Haitian authorities to ensure
  “everything is done” to secure the release of a group of people, including an
  Irish missionary and a three-year-old child, taken by gunmen who stormed a
  local orphanage. Simon Harris, the Irish foreign minister, spoke with his
  Haitian counterpart overnight, the government said in a statement, during
  which they agreed to stay in touch on their work to ensure the group is
  released, including missionary Gena Heraty who oversees the orphanage. “It is
  imperative that she is released immediately,” Harris said separately on social
  media. The attacks took place over the weekend when gunmen stormed the
  orphanage in Kenscoff, a mountainous community on the outskirts of the capital
  Port-au-Prince that has been under deadly attacks by armed gangs since the
  start of this year. Father Richard Frechette, who works with Nos Petits Freres
  et Soeurs, the international charity that runs the orphanage, said that eight
  people had been kidnapped, including the three-year-old boy, six staff members
  and Heraty, who heads special needs programs at the orphanage. “We have not
  yet been able to reach a ransom agreement to free them,” he said. “We hope for
  their fast and safe return,” the charity added on social media. “Our
  commitment to the Haitian people remains as strong as ever.” Heraty, who has
  lived in Haiti since 1993, runs the orphanage, which cares for up to 270
  children. She is the latest in a string foreign missionaries to become the
  victim of kidnapping in Haiti. Armed gangs have in recent years targeted a
  number of religious, charitable and medical aid groups, including hospitals,
  NGOs, nuns and priests from congregations based in and around the capital, as
  well as foreign missionaries. The majority of kidnapping victims are Haitian
  citizens who are seized and held for ransom, often picked opportunistically
  from the gridlocked traffic of the capital Port-au-Prince. More than 3,100
  people were killed and 336 kidnapped for ransom in the first half of this year
  in Haiti, according to BINUH estimates, as the number of residents displaced
  by the extended conflict with the powerful gangs – largely grouped behind a
  coalition called Viv Ansanm, or “Live Together” – nearly doubled to 1.3
  million. A recent report by the UN office in Haiti (BINUH) found the situation
  remained “very volatile” in Kenscoff while gangs intensified and expanded
  their attacks in central Haiti and the agricultural Artibonite region. BINUH
  considers Kenscoff of “major strategic importance” as it overlooks the suburb
  of Petion-Ville, one of the capital’s last hold-outs and the site of multiple
  embassies, banking institutions and hotels serving as diplomatic meeting
  places. Haitian authorities have repeatedly called for more resources to fight
  the gangs. A partially deployed and deeply under-equipped UN-backed mission
  kicked off over a year ago but has had little effect in slowing gangs’
  advances.
