  For a minute there, it was just like old times – with the high stakes and the
  capacity crowd and the Venus Williams on court. After Aryna Sabalenk’s singles
  match ended in a walkover on Tuesday, Williams’s doubles quarter-final was
  bumped into primetime on Louis Armstrong Stadium to fill the hole in the
  schedule. And when Williams took the court with partner Leylah Fernandez in
  her black pleated dress and matching visor as the sun dipped toward the
  horizon, she looked for all the world like a woman determined to turn back
  time. Unfortunately for her, Fernandez and the throng that gathered to cheer
  them on, their opponents were keen to skip forward. Katerina Siniakova and
  Taylor Townsend didn’t just cut the nostalgia trip short. Quite emphatically,
  they illustrated the difference between Williams and Fernandez, the doubles
  pairing out there for funsies, and themselves – the team that’s truly in it to
  win it. The top seeds’ beat Williams-Fernandez 6-2, 6-1 in just under just an
  hour. Siniakova and Townsend won all their service games, controlled the net
  and broke Williams and Fernandez at will – they beat ‘em up so bad they
  practically apologized for it afterward. In the post-match interview,
  Siniakova called it a “privilege” to play Williams, “a legend” she last played
  in 2017 – a second-round loss at the Canadian Open. “I remember I loved her
  back-out Reebok dress,” Townsend added. “That was what drew me to tennis. It
  was the cute outfits. Growing up watching Venus and Serena, [they] had always
  been, for me and my sister, an inspiration and we really wanted to be like
  them when we grew up.” There were no hard feelings on the other side. There
  never are with Williams, a trailblazer who still radiates with class and grace
  even at this intriguing late career stage. For hardcore fans who have been
  following the 21-time grand slam champion since the mid-1990s, the bonus time
  with Williams is something to savor because we don’t know how much longer it
  will last. Personally, I can remember covering this tournament 20 years ago
  when Williams used to talk about watching DVDs of the Fresh Prince to break up
  the monotony between practices and weather-induced match delays. “DVD?” she
  joked when I brought this up on Tuesday night. “I don’t know what he’s talking
  about. He’s older than me.” But she remembered. “My dad only let us watch
  educational programs growing up, so I never really got to see The Fresh Prince
  until I grew up. It was, like, major for me as a 20-year-old to watch that,
  but it never gets old.” No one could have known that that same Fresh Prince
  actor would play her father someday. “Will Smith is a legend,” she continued.”
  The fact that he did such an honor to play my dad, and he took it – you can’t
  understand how seriously he took it. He really put his whole life into it, and
  he got rewarded for it too. In turn, we all got rewarded for it. I have so
  much respect for him.” As for the casual fans born in this century? Most have
  gone their entire life without seeing Williams make history at Wimbledon, grab
  the No 1 ranking and dominate the sport until her younger sister Serena
  snatched the baton. That Venus is even still out here grinding on the women’s
  tour at age 45 while Serena has settled into retired life as a mother of two
  and a Super Bowl pop-out is striking. Big sister wasn’t supposed to be the one
  who switched off the lights. Venus’s unconventional relationship with tennis
  always made it seem as if she could take or leave the sport at any moment. She
  didn’t play juniors before turning pro at 14 and played the women’s tour at
  her own pace instead of to protect her ranking. Amid years of injury
  struggles, she has had to further contend with Sjögren’s syndrome – a chronic
  autoimmune disorder known for its energy-sapping qualities. These days the
  ferocious power and court-covering elasticity are diminished to the point of
  leaving her struggling to survive the early rounds of tournaments. For this
  year’s US Open, she was lucky to receive a wildcard. (“I’m so thankful to the
  USTA for supporting me and my effort here,” she said after Tuesday’s match.
  “It would have not been possible without them and them believing in me to be
  out here.”) Ten, 15 years ago? She could have easily called time on her career
  with public support on her side. And had she done so, you can imagine the USTA
  struggling to choose between honoring her or Althea Gibson at this year’s US
  Open. Instead, Williams effectively kicked off the festivities on Arthur Ashe
  Stadium, the center court that has long been her main stage. She played mixed
  doubles with fellow American Reilly Opelka and hung with 11th-seeded Karolina
  Muchová for two hours until she lost that first-round singles match in three
  sets. Despite her impressive resume, Williams has never been a natural doubles
  player. As long as her sister was with her on court, she only had to cover the
  alleys, watch Serena serve and let their awesome tandem power take care of the
  rest. Leading up to the US Open, there was some wishful thinking that Serena
  might come out of retirement to help a sister out. But ultimately it was
  Fernandez, the 2021 US Open finalist, who came to the rescue after the
  Canadian beat Townsend in July’s DC Open final – a victory that Williams says
  made her feel “so inspired”. It went both ways. “Seeing Venus playing on court
  for joy just kind of brought me back as to why I started playing tennis,”
  Fernandez said. ”It’s probably the most important thing is that I started
  playing tennis for the love of the game and for bringing joy on court, not
  only for myself but also for the fans.” At times, the contrast of Williams’s
  venerable eminence and Fernandez’s youthful exuberance made Williams look less
  like a peer to the 22-year-old than the rich auntie priming her for a high
  school tryout. But ultimately, they proved a formidable team on their own
  while vibing their way through the first three rounds of the doubles without
  dropping a set. Against Siniakova and Townsend, however, they were overwhelmed
  from the off and down 0-4 in 16 minutes. A 97 mph service winner from Williams
  stopped the bleeding for a moment and brought back memories of days when she
  could hit shots like that at will. ”I’m very proud that I stayed myself,” she
  said. “I didn’t try to play another game. I didn’t try to play it safe. I went
  for it, and that’s who I am. I go for it.” But for the most part, Williams and
  Fernandez’s stiff hands were no match for Siniakova and Townsend’s
  sharp-angled volleys. Afterward, Williams and Fernandez were first to concede
  that they weren’t in their element. “Leylah and I, we kept telling each other
  to be the best singles player we could be,” Williams said. “So our focus will
  always be singles. I’m not going to suddenly become a doubles player. I never
  did; I never will. It’s the singles for me.” When Serena neared the end of her
  incredible run, it took for ever for her to explicitly say the r-word –
  retired – much less concede she was no longer at her peak. But in Williams’s
  case, the thought of retirement doesn’t even seem like it’s entered her mind.
  If she has her druthers, you reckon she’ll keep showing up at tournaments and
  partnering with any top player who’ll have her – much like Martina Navratilova
  towards the end of her career – until, suddenly, she doesn’t. The real
  satisfaction in watching her now comes not in seeing if she can turn back
  time, but in how much longer she can stretch it. “I was never out of love with
  the game,” she said on Tuesday. “I never had to think about if I loved the
  game. I was always playing, so it’s part of my DNA. But clearly, like, to be
  out here grinding at this point, there has to be a little love, right?”
