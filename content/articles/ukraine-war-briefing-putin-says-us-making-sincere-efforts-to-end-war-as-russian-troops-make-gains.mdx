  Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the US was making
  “sincere efforts” to halt the war in Ukraine and suggested Moscow and
  Washington could agree a nuclear arms deal as part of a wider effort to
  strengthen peace during his meeting with Donald Trump in Alaska on Friday.
  Speaking to his most senior ministers and security officials in televised
  comments he said that the US was “making, in my opinion, quite energetic and
  sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements
  that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict”. Kremlin
  spokesperson Dmitry Peskov however warned that it would be a big mistake to
  predict the outcome of the upcoming summit, the Interfax news agency reported.
  Peskov said there were no plans to sign any documents after the summit in the
  Alaska city of Anchorage, Interfax said. Trump said he believed Putin was
  ready to make a deal on Ukraine, but his suggestion the Russian leader and
  Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could “divvy things up” was likely to
  have caused alarm some in Kyiv. The US president implied there was a 75%
  chance of the Alaska meeting succeeding, and that the threat of economic
  sanctions may have made Putin more willing to seek an end to the war. Trump
  insisted that he would not let Putin get the better of him in Friday’s
  meeting, telling reporters: “I am president, and he’s not going to mess around
  with me. “I’ll know within the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes
  or five minutes … whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad
  meeting. The Russian president will set out to woo his US counterpart and
  dangle financial incentives for siding with Moscow over Ukraine at their
  summit on Friday, Pjotr Sauer reports. On Thursday, Putin’s adviser Yuri
  Ushakov said the leaders would discuss the “huge untapped potential” in
  Russia-US economic relations. “An exchange of views is expected on further
  developing bilateral cooperation, including in the trade and economic sphere,”
  Ushakov said. “This cooperation has huge and, unfortunately so far, untapped
  potential.” European leaders praised Trump on Thursday for agreeing to allow
  US military support for a force they are mustering to police any future peace
  in Ukraine – a move that vastly improves the chances of success for an
  operation that could prove essential for the country’s security. The leaders
  said Trump offered American military backup for the European “reassurance
  force” during a call they held with him ahead of his planned summit with
  Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. They did not say what the
  assistance might involve, and Trump himself has not publicly confirmed any
  support. UK prime minister Keir Starmer welcomed Zelenskyy to London on
  Thursday in a show of British support for Ukraine ahead of the Alaska summit.
  The two embraced warmly outside Starmer’s offices at 10 Downing Street without
  making any comments. Around an hour later, Starmer walked Zelenskyy back to
  his waiting car, and the two leaders shared another embrace as the Ukrainian
  president departed. Donetsk governor Vadym Filashkin said that Ukrainian
  troops had stabilised the battlefield in an area of eastern Ukraine where
  Russian forces had made a sudden push this week to pierce Ukrainian defences.
  Ukraine said small groups of Russian infantry had thrust 10 kilometres (six
  miles) toward its main defensive line near the town of Dobropillia, raising
  fears of a wider breakthrough that would further threaten key cities. The
  advance appeared aimed at pressuring Kyiv to give up land in pursuit of peace
  three-and-a-half years into Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. “The situation
  in the Dobropillia sector has stabilised,” Filashkin wrote the Telegram
  messaging app. “Thanks to the heroic efforts of our Defence Forces, the
  frontline is reliably holding.” However Ukraine on Thursday ordered more
  evacuations in the east, from a town close to where Moscow made its
  breakthrough. “We began the mandatory evacuation of families with children
  from the town of Druzhkivka,” said Donetsk regional military administration
  head Vadym Filashkin, adding that four more villages near the town were also
  ordered to evacuate. He added that 1,879 children were remaining in the
  settlements. Earlier on Thursday, Russian forces claimed to have captured the
  village of Iskra and the small town of Shcherbynivka in Ukraine’s Donetsk
  region, which the Kremlin claimed to have annexed in September 2022. The US
  Agency for International Development did not monitor the uses of 5,175
  Starlink terminals sent to Ukraine, with nearly half of the operational units
  ending up in areas fully or partly held by Moscow, according to a report by
  the agency’s internal watchdog. USAID’s inspector general found that the
  agency failed to keep track of the terminals of Elon Musk’s satellite internet
  service because it had accepted a higher risk of misuse due to “the complex
  wartime environment” and Ukraine’s urgent need for them. The report did not
  say how those terminals ended up in those areas, who had them or the purposes
  for which they were used. Russia and Ukraine exchanged 84 prisoners each on
  Thursday, both sides said, the latest in a series of swaps that has seen
  hundreds of PoW released so far this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy said on social media that among the exchanged prisoners were “both
  military personnel and civilians”, some of whom had been “held by the Russians
  since 2014, 2016, and 2017”. He said “defenders of Mariupol” were also part of
  the swap, referring to a Ukrainian port city that fell to Russian forces in
  2022 after a nearly three-month siege. Russia has put Reporters Without
  Borders (RSF) on its list of “undesirable” organisations, effectively banning
  the media watchdog from operating in the country, Moscow’s justice ministry
  register showed on Thursday. Under a controversial law passed in 2015, but
  rarely used before its offensive on Ukraine, Russia can ban overseas
  organisations deemed a threat to national security. Russian State Duma chair
  Vyacheslav Volodin met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un during an official
  visit to Pyongyang, the Russian parliament said on Thursday. Volodin, a close
  ally of President Vladimir Putin, conveyed greetings from the Russian leader
  and thanked Kim for North Korea’s support of Russia’s military campaign in
  Ukraine.
