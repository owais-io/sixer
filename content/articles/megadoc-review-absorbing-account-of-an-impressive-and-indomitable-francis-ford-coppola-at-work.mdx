  Megadoc review – absorbing account of an impressive and indomitable Francis
  Ford Coppola at work

bodyText: >-
  When Francis Ford Coppola finally started work on his retrofuturist ancient
  Rome drama-parable Megalopolis (the self-funded passion project he had been
  nurturing for decades), he invited another director to be a fly on the wall
  and make a record of his work in progress. This was Mike Figgis, whose limber
  digital film-making skills were ideal for the task. The result is a thoroughly
  watchable, respectful, valuable and intimate account of a great film-maker at
  work – particularly rehearsing actors, a part of directing very rarely shown.
  (Coppola takes his cast through some wacky exploratory games, like an
  experimental theatre company.) It’s always impressive to see the indomitable
  Coppola in full rhetorical flow: holding forth, opining, schooling one and all
  on what happens when a film is made and how glorious it is to spend and even
  lose money in the service of cinema. Coppola is always entrepreneurially
  magnificent on this subject. And before this documentary, I had thought that
  Alfred Hitchcock was the last director on earth who came to work in a collar
  and tie. No: it’s Coppola. Figgis is tactfully silent over reports of
  Coppola’s inappropriate behaviour with female supporting actors on set – that
  is a flaw, though he does cover Coppola sacking his entire VFX team midway
  through the shoot. Megalopolis cost $120m (£98m) (at least) that Coppola put
  up himself by selling part of his wine business, and Figgis shrewdly breaks
  down these eye-watering costs – up to $20,000 (£15,000) a day on catering for
  big crowd scenes. Yet what Figgis does mostly is concentrate on Coppola’s
  attitude to working with his stars, young and old. And there are tender and
  moving moments showing Eleanor Coppola making set and location visits; that
  is, Francis’s now late wife (herself a brilliant fly-on-the-wall documentarian
  who made Hearts of Darkness, about Apocalypse Now). Figgis also shows some
  rows, including endless arguments with the insufferably difficult Shia
  LaBeouf, but there are interesting and more relaxed and genial interviews with
  Jon Voight, Aubrey Plaza and Dustin Hoffman. We also get video clips of the
  table read from 2001, the last time this project almost got off the ground,
  with Uma Thurman and Robert De Niro. I still can’t be convinced that
  Megalopolis is anything other than an (honourable) failure. But Figgis’s
  documentary is an absorbing success. • Megadoc screened at the Venice film
  festival.
