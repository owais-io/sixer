  I’ve been diagnosed with cancer twice in the past 12 months. Here’s what the

  I’m 45 years old and battling cancer. A few weeks ago I threw up at work with
  such force that I peed myself. My first thought was: the treatment pamphlets
  tell you to sip peppermint tea and keep a fan at your desk for nausea, but
  nowhere did they mention you might find yourself in the staff bathroom
  vomiting so hard you become incontinent. If they had, I’d have popped a spare
  pair of undies in my work bag. I was diagnosed just before Christmas last
  year. It was a complete shock: I was 44 and the healthiest I’d been in years.
  At first, I was given an excellent prognosis, and after the initial shock, I
  rallied like never before. I decided I was going to face this head-on, full of
  positive energy. But after surgery and pathology, the language shifted. They
  started using the word “good” instead of “excellent”, and we realised this was
  going to be more of a fight. I gathered as much information as I could, along
  with every resource available, determined to be prepared. But nobody told me
  about the messy parts. After speaking to some fellow cancer warriors, I’ve
  compiled a list of the advice I wish I’d been given at the start. 1. You don’t
  have to follow the advice At one of your initial appointments, you will be
  handed a tonne of information from the Cancer Council, and most of it is solid
  gold. But you don’t have to do everything that’s recommended. This is a shock,
  and I’m sorry it’s happened to you, and it’s OK to do this your way. I started
  by sharing everything publicly and was overwhelmed with wonderful support.
  Nine months in and I’ve retreated into myself and don’t want to talk to anyone
  about it. Both are OK. My oncology counsellor told me to stick to my normal
  schedule as much as possible and not to give cancer more power than it already
  has. This was fine until recently when I had to cut back hours at work. I’m
  not giving cancer power, however – I’m giving my body the rest it needs. 2.
  Give your body what it needs Right now I need rest, nutritious meals when I
  can handle them, sunlight and movement. There’s new research that suggests
  exercise plays a vital role in cancer treatment, and it’s encouraged where
  possible. Personally, I find it improves my mood, gets me outside and helps me
  feel I’m taking a proactive step towards health. Likewise, I spoke to a fellow
  cancer warrior who explained that she loves juicing – each day she will head
  to the fruit market and carefully choose her fruits and vegetables. She
  explained she understands that juice is probably doing nothing for her cancer,
  but it’s not bad for her and helps her feel proactive. I’m not into juice, but
  after speaking with her, I now have salad for lunch every day. My daily bowl
  of rainbow veggies isn’t a cure, but it is a ritual that feels as though I’m
  telling cancer to fuck off. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s
  fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter 3. Your body will change in
  unexpected ways You might pee yourself when you spew – look, it happens.
  Chemotherapy in particular will mess with your digestive system and you will
  immediately map out the toilets of any public space you are in. You might lose
  your hair – everywhere. Losing your nasal hair means your nose will run
  constantly. Losing your pubic hair makes you fart really loudly. Steroids make
  you pack on weight; other medications will strip it off frighteningly fast. 4.
  Cancer hurts, and some of that pain is financial I have stopped working
  full-time and we are so very broke right now. My diagnosis coincided with the
  cost-of-living crisis, so we’ve never needed a second income more. And cancer
  is expensive. It’s not as bulk billed as you would expect – the fine needle
  biopsy used to diagnose my cancer cost $380 after the Medicare rebate. The
  medical costs add up quickly. 5. You will become your own best advocate Sure,
  you should find a knowledgable medical team who has your best interests at
  heart, but you know your body best. If something doesn’t feel right, keep
  pushing until it’s paid attention to. It’s OK to demand that scan, try a
  different medication and to discuss treatment options. You are not difficult.
  You deserve solutions. 6. You will lose friends and gain unexpected ones
  There’s this idea that challenging times “show us who our real friends are”
  but that’s not the case at all. Cancer is a lot, and not everyone can take
  this journey with you. It doesn’t make them bad people, it’s just that life is
  heavy for everyone and they don’t currently have space for you. But the people
  who stay with you will hold you up in ways you never knew you’d need, and
  you’ll make new friends too. 7. Cancer is a rollercoaster Lots of metaphors
  work, but this one is the best. The sudden jolting start, the highs, the lows,
  the speed increase and decrease and the twist you didn’t see coming. All of
  this is geared to get you to the exit: remission or NED – no evidence of
  disease. But here’s what you didn’t know: if you’re lucky you can get off the
  rollercoaster, but you can’t ever leave the amusement park. Every three, six,
  12 months you have your scans and blood tests and see if you’re being dragged
  back on for another spin. I was thrown back on this year after a scan revealed
  new tumours, this time in my lung. I have lost the positivity that powered me
  through the first round. I’m not sharing as much because there’s nothing to
  say. It isn’t fair the first time, but the second time hits you where it
  hurts. 8. You aren’t alone There is so much help available. My family and
  friends, once they knew what was going on, cooked meals, grocery shopped, took
  care of our youngest and supported our eldest. I live in regional New South
  Wales and the charity Can Assist has been a lifeline. They pay for all of my
  cancer medications, including my radiation meds, and will cover transport and
  accommodation costs when I have to travel to Sydney for treatment. Your local
  hospital should be able to point you in the direction of a social worker who
  will find all of these helpful options for you. There’s probably a support
  group near you – make use of it. 9. You don’t have to stay positive You don’t
  have to be brave. You don’t have to be the best cancer patient and be liked
  and be an example to others. It’s OK to cry. Just make sure you reach out for
  help if it feels as if you are drowning in your tears. 10. You won’t be the
  same But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. You will experience a loss of
  autonomy like never before. One moment my husband and I were discussing trying
  for a third baby, and the next I’m signing forms promising to not get pregnant
  for at least 12 months post radiation. But I’m stronger and surer of myself
  now, and I understand the fragility of life. I take fewer things for granted
  and prioritise my family over my career. The pamphlets can’t tell you all
  this. But those of us who’ve been on the ride can. And if you’ve just found
  yourself holding that ticket – pack the spare undies. Trust me. Emily Thompson
