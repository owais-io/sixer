  If you’ve heard of savagnin (nope, not sauvignon), you may well be one of
  those in-the-know wine drinkers who have been ushered in the direction of the
  Jura, this grape’s iconic region, after being priced out of your favourite
  burgundy. And while there are some similarities between the two regions, a
  focus on chardonnay and pinot noir being the most obvious, there are plenty of
  other varieties for discerning wine nerds, and savagnin is definitely one of
  them. It’s a grape variety that’s been grown in France for 900 years, with
  high acidity and a late-ripening in the vineyard, and it’s known for the
  complex, age-worthy styles of wine it can create. It’s also grown just over
  the border in Switzerland, where it’s known as heida, as well as in Australia,
  where it was once mistaken for albariño. In the Jura, however, this high-acid
  grape produces nuanced still wines, and wines made in the vin jaune style, for
  which the wine is matured under yeast to give it a nutty, complex character
  akin to that of a biologically aged sherry such as fino. The curious character
  of these wines makes them a sommelier’s secret weapon, as Donald Edwards,
  consultant sommelier, tells me: “Vin jaune scratches an itch that’s hard to
  sort any other way: oily, sharp, salty, a little bit wrong, but also
  ridiculously moreish. The Jura’s chardonnays seem to rewrite exactly what that
  variety can be in terms of expression, but it’s the savagnins that really
  epitomise the area, snarling at you, while at the same time being defiantly
  discordant in the most thrilling way. ” Because of the region’s relatively
  small output (a quick glance at Decanter reveals 230 wineries and an average
  production of 11 million bottles, so a fraction of France’s other regions),
  you’re more likely to find savagnin, and other Jura wines, for that matter, in
  more boutique-y retailers. They’re also likely to be a lot more expensive
  than, say, sauvignon, or any other such wine that’s produced everywhere and by
  everyone. Imagine my surprise/shock/delight, then, when the Wine Society
  recently announced that it’s bringing a côtes du Jura to its own-label range
  for £18.50. Yes, I know as well as you that this isn’t a bargain in the
  literal sense, but it’s not too bad a shout considering the 100% savagnin
  currently on the society’s website is £27, while a lot of other Jura
  frequently topples over the £30 mark. Hopefully, this might also open the
  doors for supermarkets and other big retailers to do the same, so my wallet
  can take less of a flogging every time I want to open my mouth to the nutty,
  savoury flavours of the Jura. Four Jura wines to pique your interest The
  Society’s Exhibition Côtes du Jura £18.50 The Wine Society, 13.5%. Salted
  almonds abound in this complex and interesting white that’s about 50%
  savagnin. Tissot-Maire Blanc de Blancs Crémant du Jura NV £16.25 Corney &amp;
  Barrow, 12%. Luxurious Jura crémant that’s aged for four years on the lees.
  Domaine Jean-Louis Tissot Poulsard £18.25 Yapp Brothers, 13.5%. Poulsard is
  another of the Jura’s unique, pleasing varieties: red cherry and pinot-like
  spice. Fruitière Vinicole d’Arbois Chardonnay £14.50 The Wine Society, 13.5%.
  From one of the oldest wine cooperatives in France, this fruit-forward
  chardonnay shows apples and pears.
