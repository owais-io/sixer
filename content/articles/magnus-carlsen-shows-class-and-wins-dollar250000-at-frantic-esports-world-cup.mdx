  Magnus Carlsen was in imperious form at last week’s Esports World Cup in
  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with a virtuoso performance both on and off the board.
  On it, the world No 1 won the group stage, the quarter- and semi-finals, and
  the final, all in dominant style while seeing off the world No 2, Hikaru
  Nakamura, and one of the leading young contenders, Alireza Firouzja. Offboard,
  Carlsen exuded enthusiasm for the event, and delivered upbeat and articulate
  responses to interviewers. The limit of 10 minutes per player per game,
  without the usual per move increment, was designed for tight TV schedules, and
  also led to frantic time scrambles and games decided by fractions of a second.
  A new chess phrase was coined, “dirty flagging”, to describe playing to win on
  the clock in a totally lost or drawn position before the opponent with less
  time can force checkmate. Carlsen himself declined his first two opportunities
  to use this technique, but accepted a third when the match situation became
  critical. In general, the time control favoured Carlsen, Nakamura and
  Firouzja, who between them have played tens of thousands of blitz and bullet
  (all the moves in one minute) games on chess.com and lichess.org. Carlsen made
  a seemingly conscious effort to present chess in the best possible light. The
  overall event may have been sportswashing, but the enormous queues to watch
  every day and the obvious enjoyment of the audiences showed the potential for
  a new market. The tournament was slickly organised, with fast-moving
  interviews, game analyses, reviews and tactical highlights all following in
  quick succession. The online audience on chess.com for the final exceeded
  30,000 viewers, more than five times the usual number for a grandmaster
  tournament. There was over-hype, but not enough to jar. The lead commentator,
  England’s David Howell, enhanced his reputation as he continually provided
  calm and objective analysis. Gradually, Howell is becoming the first choice
  commentator for major chess events. In short, all the signs were that the
  Esports World Cup can become a permanent and welcome addition to the annual
  chess calendar. There is a new candidate to become the next super-talent after
  Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov and Carlsen. At barely 14, Turkey’s Yagiz Kaan
  Erdogmus has broken numerous age records. He is the youngest ever to achieve a
  2600 rating, a record previously held by Judit Polgar, and the second youngest
  after Polgar to reach Fide’s world top 100. Last week Erdogmus defeated the
  eight-time Russian champion Peter Svidler by 4-2 in a classical match, the
  highlight being a 22-move win against his opponent’s favourite Grunfeld
  Defence with a double rook sacrifice, one rook in the game and the other in
  the notes. Erdogmus now has a fleeting opportunity to beat Fischer’s
  achievement of qualifying for the world title candidates at age 15. The
  Turkish youngster will have two chances to do it, at the Fide World Cup and
  Grand Swiss later this year. The nine-round British championship at Liverpool
  has its final round on Sunday morning. After five rounds, the eight-time title
  winner Michael Adams, 53, led with 4.5/5 by half a point from a group of
  eight, who included the top-seeded former Russian champion Nikita Vitiugov.
  Victory would enable the Taunton, Somerset-based grandmaster to equal Henry
  Atkins’s nine championships from the first half of the 20th century and leave
  him just one short of Jonathan Penrose’s total of 10 from the second half.
  Adams’s subtle fourth round rook endgame against the GM Nigel Davies was a
  classic, while in round five he exploited Shreyas Royal’s hesitant opening to
  establish early dominance. Adams retained his slender half point over a
  10-player peloton in Thursday’s sixth round with a solid draw against
  Vitiugov, but the two eye-catching results were by Royal, as the 16-year-old
  won an truly elegant 27-mover against IM Marcus Harvey, and 11-year-old
  Supratit Banerjee, who showcased his burgeoning talent by defeating GM Simon
  Williams. The championship outcome remained unclear after Friday’s seventh
  round, when Adams missed a chance to consolidate his lead and was joined by
  Royal, who defeated Wadsworth. Adams and Royal have 5.5/7, followed by 13
  players on 5/7. In the women’s championship, Elmira Mirzoeva leads on 4.5/7,
  followed by Lan Yao and 10-year-old Bodhana Sivanandan on 4/7. There is live
  coverage and commentary by GMs Danny Gormally and Nick Pert on the English
  Chess Federation’s YouTube channel starting at 2.30pm on Saturday and 10am on
  Sunday. 3984 1 Nxf7! and Black resigned. If 1…Rxf7 2 Qb3! and 3 Qxf7+ wins. If
  1…Bc7 2 Qb3 Qb5 3 Nxh6+ Kh8 4 Rxf8 mate.
