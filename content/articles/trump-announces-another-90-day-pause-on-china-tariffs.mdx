  Donald Trump has once again delayed implementing sweeping tariffs on China,
  announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between
  the world’s two largest economies was due to expire. On Monday, the US
  president signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs
  on China until 10 November, officials confirmed to Reuters. Chinese officials
  said earlier in the day they hoped the United States would strive for
  “positive” trade outcomes on Monday, as the 90-day detente reached between the
  two countries in May was due to expire. China’s commerce ministry, in a
  statement on early Tuesday, said it will suspend additional tariffs on US
  goods for 90 more days, after Trump signed an executive order extending the
  tariff truce. China will maintain its tariffs on US goods at 10%, the
  statement said, and take action to address non-tariff barriers facing American
  products. China will also postpone for 90 days the addition of US firms it had
  targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists. “We hope that the
  US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the
  phone call between the two heads of state … and strive for positive outcomes
  on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” a foreign ministry
  spokesperson, Lin Jian, said in an earlier statement on Monday. Chinese and US
  officials said they expected the pause to be extended after the most recent
  round of trade talks held last month in Stockholm. Scott Bessent, the US
  treasury secretary, said last week the US had “the makings” of a trade deal
  with China and that he was optimistic about a path forward. Failure to reach a
  deal would have major consequences. Trump had threatened tariffs on China as
  high as 245%, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%, setting off
  a trade war between the world’s largest economies. On Sunday, Trump posted on
  TruthSocial that China should quadruple its purchases of soybeans from the US
  to help reduce the trade deficit between the US and China. Currently, US
  exports to China are subject to tariffs of about 30%, with imports from China
  subject to a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra tariff in response to
  fentanyl smuggling allegations against China. Some products are taxed at
  higher rates. The Federal Reserve and many economists have argued that the
  tariffs will push up prices in the US. Goldman Sachs strategists calculate
  that US consumers have absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June 2025. That
  share is expected to rise to 67% if recent tariffs follow the same pattern as
  earlier ones. Before the tariff deadline, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD agreed to
  pay the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China
  in exchange for export licenses to the market. Stephen Olson, a former US
  trade negotiator, told Bloomberg of the deal: “What we are seeing is in effect
  the monetization of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US
  government for permission to export. If that’s the case, we’ve entered into a
  new and dangerous world.” Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting
