  public health

  Current and former employees at US health agencies released a letter on
  Wednesday outlining how misinformation spread by Robert F Kennedy Jr is
  endangering the lives of federal employees and the American people. Experts
  emphasized to the Guardian that he’s “an existential threat to public health”.
  On 8 August, a gunman killed a police officer, David Rose, and fired nearly
  500 bullets, shattering 150 windows, at the Atlanta headquarters of the
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The man, who was killed on
  the scene, believed the Covid-19 vaccine caused his depression. Kennedy,
  secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has been
  “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and
  endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health
  information”, said the letter, which was signed by more than 750 current and
  former employees from HHS agencies, including the CDC and the National
  Institutes of Health (NIH), and addressed to Kennedy and the US Congress. The
  employees drafted the letter in their personal capacity, they said. Pressure
  against Kennedy is mounting in public health. “When your own leadership
  peddles falsehoods, it doesn’t just erode the public trust, it creates the
  conditions for the kind of violence that we saw on Friday,” Yolanda Jacobs,
  president of American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) local 2883 and
  a CDC employee, told reporters last week. “This was a targeted attack. It was
  a targeted act of violence against not just CDC, but CDC’s employees.” The
  shooting was “public health’s Jan 6,” Colin Carlson, an assistant professor of
  epidemiology at Yale University’s School of Public Health, co-wrote in an
  op-ed calling for the resignation of health officials, including Kennedy, who
  have spread dangerous misinformation. “To me, the worst case scenario is, and
  has always been, that someone shows up with a gun,” Carlson said. “It’s really
  important that we do something now, while we can, before the shooting that
  kills more people. Because this will keep happening. It will spread, and it
  will get worse.” Kennedy, a prominent anti-vaccine advocate for two decades,
  has called the CDC a “cesspool of corruption”. He has made numerous false
  claims about mRNA vaccines, calling Covid vaccines the “deadliest vaccine ever
  made”. He replaced members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee with
  largely inexperienced advisers, some of whom have histories of anti-vaccine
  activism. One of the advisers, Robert Malone, posted violent images directed
  at scientists in the hours before and soon after the CDC shooting, prompting
  the Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, of Connecticut, to demand his
  removal and the restoration of the original experts to the committee. The
  letter on Wednesday decried the “deliberate destruction of trust in America’s
  public health workforce”, which puts employees at risk of violence and keeps
  them from working to protect the health of Americans. Kennedy’s “dangerous and
  deceitful statements and actions have contributed to the harassment and
  violence experienced by CDC staff”, the letter read. Matthew Buckham,
  Kennedy’s acting chief of staff, was co-founder of the group that maintains a
  “DEI Watch List” targeting HHS employees. Watch lists like these have
  published the photos and personal home addresses of federal workers, who have
  been threatened in their homes, said Vi Le, an expert on preventing gun
  violence. When Le heard about the shooting, she scrambled to pull together
  resources for CDC employees. But she didn’t do it on behalf of the CDC; she
  did it as a volunteer with the AFGE. That’s because in April, her entire
  department on preventing gun violence in the US was let go. Yet when asked how
  he would address misinformation leading to violence in the wake of the CDC
  shooting, Kennedy pointed to past public health officials who he said “have
  not been honest” about Covid vaccines. “An attack on a US government agency
  should be a moment in time when we come together,” Dr Anne Schuchat, former
  principal deputy director of the CDC, said in a statement about the letter.
  “Instead, Secretary Kennedy continues to spread misinformation at the risk of
  American lives.” The HHS did not respond by press time to the Guardian’s media
  inquiries about the role of health officials in promoting misinformation that
  may lead to violence. Employees also called on the NIH director, Jay
  Bhattacharya, to “refrain from his dangerous politicization of mRNA vaccine
  technology”. The day after the CDC shooting, Bhattacharya appeared on Steve
  Bannon’s podcast to push back on what he characterized as health officials’
  “relentless propaganda and pressure” to take the mRNA Covid vaccines.
  Bhattacharya spoke about how the former director of the CDC, Rochelle
  Walensky, was “blinded” to the “facts” of the vaccine, which he said had
  harmful side effects. “As far as public health goes, for vaccines the mRNA
  platform is no longer viable,” Bhattacharya said. It echoed previous
  statements of his putting the blame for anti-vaccine sentiment on US
  officials. In July 2024, Bhattacharya said that people who claimed to be
  injured by vaccines became “public enemy number one in 2021”, adding they were
  seen as a “threat” to officials’ efforts to distribute vaccines. Last week,
  Bhattacharya published an op-ed arguing that “mRNA technology has failed to
  earn the public’s trust”. “Within days of the shooting, all of these guys were
  back out there immediately talking about how dangerous vaccines are,” Carlson
  said. “We see them condemn the violence and act like they had nothing to do
  with it, and then we also see them repeat the messaging that the shooter
  believed.” Rhetoric about the harms of vaccines, and the alleged dangers posed
  by health officials, is circulated and amplified in anti-vaccine circles,
  especially online. The man arrested for killing Minnesota lawmaker Melissa
  Hortman and her husband, Mark, in June told the conservative blog the Blaze
  that he confronted the couple because he believed the mRNA shots were killing
  people. Violence is the point of decades of anti-vaccine and anti-scientific
  disinformation – not a byproduct but a tool, Carlson said. Stochastic
  terrorism, in which public figures use mass media to inspire political
  violence, has been used to harm trans people and abortion providers, for
  example, in the past. “They’ve learned the comfortable distance between
  incitement and violence,” Carlson said. “The Maga movement is incredibly good
  at saying just enough and distributing the burden of incitement within its
  ecosystem, letting the people at the top set the messaging and then having
  places like rightwing news outlets and social media sites do the work of
  amplifying and accelerating and putting violence to the messaging.” Removing
  officials like Kennedy and preventing future violence is “the only path” to
  restoring trust in public health, Carlson said. He added: “This is an
  existential threat to public health. If we fight and lose, that’s OK, but I
  would rather fight and lose than lie down.”
