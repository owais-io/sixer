  Extreme politics and extreme weather go hand in hand, and both have to be
  confronted if we are to understand and overcome the polycrisis we are living
  through. Yet few media organisations are examining why the climate emergency
  is creating a new era of demagogues. Even fewer are scrutinising how those
  authoritarian leaders are trying to misdirect public attention away from the
  root cause of our current global malaise. The Guardian is different. About
  nine out of every 10 people in the world want their governments to take
  stronger climate actions, yet we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift away from the
  progress we need to avert climate disaster. Powerful governments, financial
  institutions and big oil companies are turning their back on climate promises
  and some are funding secretive lobby groups and far-right politicians that
  want to shift away from the progress we need to make real, positive change.
  The pushback has been shocking. Debunking climate disinformation is a
  full-time task for Guardian environment teams across the world, particularly
  in the United States, now that the world’s biggest fossil fuel producer
  appears intent on undermining hard-won progress on reducing emissions. The
  most obvious elements of disinformation are the wild conspiracy theories
  spread by social media influencers and bots. Instead of attributing disasters
  to fossil fuels and cuts to emergency services and the US National Weather
  Service, in July they spread unfounded rumours that the deadly floods in Texas
  were caused by sinister weather modification technology. In this
  anything-but-the-truth realm, California wildfires were supposedly planned by
  officials to destroy child-trafficking tunnels, while the devastation in North
  Carolina caused by Hurricane Helene was apparently the result of a hushed-up
  dam failure and cloud seeding. Then there are rightwing media organisations
  that jump to politically convenient – but wrong – interpretations of events,
  such as the false claims that renewable energy caused the recent massive
  blackout in Spain. Most alarming are the brazen lies of the likes of Donald
  Trump, who has called climate science “a giant hoax”, “a scam” and “bullshit”.
  This is a double falsehood – firstly because climate research is robust and
  supported by 99.9% of specialists, and secondly because Trump and many of his
  influential supporters in business and politics are well aware of the global
  heating risks and are responding in a way that suggests they think their best
  hope for survival is to build up their wealth, consider invading cooler
  neighbouring countries, such as Canada and Greenland, and prepare their
  doomsday bunkers. There also appears to be an insidious strategy to keep
  people in the dark about the environment for as long as possible. The Guardian
  has tracked how the Trump administration is defunding world-leading climate
  research agencies, firing droves of scientists and threatening official
  portals that were formerly hubs of cutting-edge information about climate
  trends. Amid so much uncertainty, we published the US National Climate Report
  in full to ensure it can be found, for free, in the public domain. Worse could
  still be to come. In the US, Trump has declared an “energy emergency” as an
  excuse to carve open more land and ocean for oil and gas exploration, which is
  expected to lead to a sharp increase in US greenhouse gas emissions. Fossil
  fuel companies, such as Koch Industries, are funding an association of
  Republican attorneys which includes many Republican attorneys general who are
  trying to block states seeking compensation for weather disasters caused by
  climate change. The Orwellian developments in the US have not yet been
  replicated on the other side of the Atlantic, but Guardian reporters are
  investigating how money from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests are
  funding thinktanks linked to far-right groups in Britain and Europe. This is a
  clear attempt to break down the longstanding consensus over climate science
  and net zero campaigns, despite the very strong public support for both.
  Earlier this year, the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, and former
  Conservative prime minister Liz Truss attended the launch of Heartland
  UK/Europe which is headed by a climate denier and part of a US network funded
  by the petroleum company ExxonMobil and wealthy US Republican donors. The
  Guardian has revealed how Heartland has been wooing far-right European
  politicians since at least February 2023. In these bleak times, it is also
  crucial to report on the strength of the resistance and the possibility for
  positive change: the leaders still seeking global solutions, the youth
  activists who have launched a new campaign to “villainise big oil” and lobby
  for compensation for climate damages (which is reminiscent of the Guardian’s
  earlier Polluters series to name and shame the companies most responsible for
  the climate emergency), the taskforce dreaming up radical climate solutions,
  and the campaigns that remind us that the overwhelming majority of people in
  the world want more ambitious climate action. We are not alone. This is not a
  fringe issue. Nor is it a hoax or an impossibly expensive challenge, no matter
  what Silicon Valley social media, Russian bots and Saudi oil money try to tell
  us. But we need to stick together and keep focusing on real stories, real
  problems and real people. Our reporters are dedicated to exposing the forces
  working to undermine environmental progress and protections. If you don’t

  contribution. It takes less than a minute to set up and makes a huge
  difference. Support the Guardian Join George Monbiot and special guests on 16
