  A Black warehouse worker has won a race harassment claim after a disgruntled
  colleague wrote the word “slave” on a piece of machinery. The colleague had
  meant it not as a racial slur but as an expression of his anger at, as he saw
  it, being overworked and underpaid, an employment tribunal heard. But the
  presence of the word in the workplace violated Seedy Fofana’s dignity and
  created a “hostile, humiliating and offensive environment for him”, the
  tribunal ruled. Awarding Fofana £3,000 compensation, the employment judge
  David Hughes concluded that the graffito did relate to race even though that
  had not been the intention. Hughes said: “This is because the term ‘slave’
  will, we find, evoke in contemporary English speakers the enslavement of Black
  people. All right-thinking people regard slavery as a monstrosity. “Mr Fofana,
  an evidently proud Black man, feels the evil of slavery viscerally. That is
  understandable and respectable. We accept his sense of hurt at the graffito is
  genuine.” He added: “The graffito could bear a number of meanings. It could
  carry the meaning that [the colleague] intended. It might have been understood
  as a comment on obedient machinery … taking the place of the labour of humans,
  or on humans’ relationship to machines. “But when one hears the word slavery,
  English speakers in this jurisdiction in this decade will probably first think
  of the enslavement of Black people by white people.” The hearing in Bristol
  was told that Fofana was the only Black man at Window Widgets in Gloucester,
  which deals in plastic and metal parts for windows. Another worker, Tony
  Bennett, had taken to writing graffiti referencing “modern slavery” and
  “slavery” around the warehouse in protest at working conditions. This included
  writing the words “Slave No” with an arrow pointing to the number 3 on a
  Hubtex machine, which is similar to a forklift truck. Bosses removed all the
  graffiti created by Bennett except the one on the Hubtex as they had not
  spotted it, but Fofana saw it during a stock-take. He did not report it but
  resigned the following month complaining about hostile behaviour and sued the
  company, claiming £500,000 in compensation. The judge said the conclusion that
  the company had failed to remove a piece of graffiti that it had not seen
  might be seen as harsh. The judgment said that once the company was made aware
  of it, it removed it.
