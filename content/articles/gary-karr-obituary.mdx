  The American virtuoso bassist Gary Karr, who has died aged 83 after a brain
  aneurysm, brought the double bass into the limelight as a solo instrument. He
  embraced the skills of his bass predecessors Domenico Dragonetti, Giovanni
  Bottesini and Serge Koussevitzky, then raised the bar to a new level through
  his sheer joy in playing and communication of his love for the instrument,
  combined with an unrivalled technical skill. Hugo Cole in the Guardian,
  recalling Karr’s visit to the UK in 1978, likened him to an ostrich suddenly
  becoming a nightingale and remarked that his “breathtaking solo bass playing
  is surely one of the wonders of 20th-century musical performance”. One of the
  elements of Karr’s playing that set him apart was the way he used the bow.
  “I’ve always considered myself a lyrical artist. My first desire was to be a
  singer, so I have always been determined to sing on the bass.” He drew his
  individual, intense sound with long slow bows, playing close to the bridge,
  and projecting differently from the traditional back-of-the-string-section
  sound familiar from his youth. He applied many of the techniques of the upper
  strings to the bass. Karr was strongly influenced by the mezzo-soprano Jennie
  Tourel, who mentored him in the vocal skills of breathing and phrasing. In
  1962 she enabled a private audition with Leonard Bernstein, who engaged Karr
  to perform Bloch’s Prayer and Paganini’s Moses Fantasy variations as part of
  the Young People’s Concert series with the New York Philharmonic. “I don’t
  know when I’ve heard anything like it since the great Koussevitzky,” said
  Bernstein in his introduction to the concert. Bernstein had asked Karr whether
  the Paganini had an orchestral part. It didn’t, so Karr arranged one, and it
  was this performance, televised to millions, that launched his career. As a
  soloist, he was to play with leading orchestras worldwide, including the
  Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the London
  Philharmonic and the Hong Kong Philharmonic. His first recording, entitled
  simply Gary Karr plays Double Bass, was issued later in 1962 by Golden Crest
  Records. That was the year in which Herman Reinshagen died, a teacher who
  greatly influenced Karr: “He exuded such enthusiasm, and although he might
  have held me back a bit by forcing the old traditions on me, in retrospect I
  only appreciate the positive things.” The same year, after the groundbreaking
  concert, Olga Koussevitzky, convinced the spirit of her husband lived on in
  Karr, gave him Serge’s 1611 Amati bass (now thought by experts to be French,
  about 1811, but still a significant instrument through its history). Later
  Karr donated it to the International Society of Bassists, an organisation he
  founded to create and nurture a network of bass players. Karr’s family came
  originally from Vilnius, in Lithuania, where generations had played the bass.
  Once in the US, they moved to Los Angeles to work in Hollywood movies. His
  father, Joe (who changed his surname from Kornbleit), a shoemaker, could not
  read music but played the bass in dance bands; his mother, Miriam Nadel, was
  an oboist. The 1939 film They Shall Have Music, with Jascha Heifetz playing
  himself, features an orchestra that included all but one of the Nadel-Karr
  family. Karr’s sister Arla Capps was a harpist, playing the instrument with a
  dark projected Russian sound that Karr said influenced his pizzicato. Karr
  started the bass with Uda Demenstein, who had taught his grandfather, uncles
  and cousin. As a child he began to adapt pieces such as Ravel’s Habanera and
  the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria, and arrange baroque repertoire (later studying,
  playing and recording his teacher Stuart Sankey’s many baroque
  transcriptions). Many of the celebrated players of the day (Heifetz, André
  Previn, Artur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern) were soloists with the California
  Junior Symphony, in which Karr played, and left lasting impressions,
  technically and musically. He took lessons from the Hungarian cellist Gábor
  Rejtő, and was inspired to use the technique of four fingers in his left hand,
  rather than the three promoted by the bass pedagogue Franz Simandl, and also
  benefited from tuition from the cellist Zara Nelsova. An audition for the
  Curtis Institute, Philadelphia, run by the violinist Efrem Zimbalist (who had
  arrived from Vilnius at the same time as Karr’s grandfather) was successful –
  but only if Karr changed from an underhand German bowing technique to French
  overhand. Karr refused – though later in life he experimented more freely with
  his bowing technique. For his application to the Juilliard in New York, he was
  required to fulfil the same entrance requirements as brass players; the bass
  was not included in the string department and his bass teacher there, Sankey,
  was a member of the brass department. Later he taught at Juilliard and Yale,
  and other top music departments and summer schools, but devoted much of his
  enthusiasm to teaching in schools, mixing psychology, parenting and humour. He
  kept his performance schedule alive in the summers. “I knew of no other
  concert artist who had interrupted his career to teach in public schools,” he
  recalled. “But I loved the controversy and hoped to make an impact, to change
  the music education system and reverse the worldwide trend of aging classical
  music audiences.” He met his long-term pianist and life partner, Harmon Lewis,
  in 1961. Together they created an engaging stage presence, Karr supplementing
  his almost magical technical facility with enthusiasm and a jokey manner. His
  discography shows his wide range of technical accomplishments in arrangements,
  and acknowledgement of his mentors such as Koussevitzky and Dragonetti. Carr
  was a master arranger and instigator of new repertoire in his commissions –
  Hans Werner Henze and Lalo Schifrin were among many who wrote for him. He
  wanted to engage a younger audience in the bass. Students tell of his support.
  One recalled how, on a junior camp in 1979, the conductor was being
  consistently unfriendly to the participants and Karr, a soloist there with
  Yehudi Menuhin, led him on a merry dance, extending the cadenza without prior
  warning. “We owe Maestro Karr big time.” Lewis and Karr lived in Connecticut
  for many years before moving to Victoria, British Columbia, in 1995 and taking
  Canadian citizenship. Karr retired from performing in 2001. Lewis died in
  2023. • Gary Karr, double bass player, arranger, composer and teacher, born 20
