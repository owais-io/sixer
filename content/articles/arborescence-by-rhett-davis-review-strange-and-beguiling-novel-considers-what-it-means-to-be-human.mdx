  “It’s hard, I think, to know that you are the problem.” This is the reality
  that Bren and Caelyn, the couple at the heart of Rhett Davis’ second novel,
  Arborescence, must grapple with as they tally the losses of the climate
  crisis. “It’s hard to drive through these places and not feel the wreck of it,
  the ruin, the violence and the removals of its people.” At the beginning of
  this strange and beguiling novel, we find ourselves in the company of these
  two twentysomethings looking for hope, meaning and connection as the world
  around them fractures. Bren, our narrator, is a plain-speaking, good-hearted
  young man who yearns for the world he knows to stay the same, and also for
  stability in his relationship with the mercurial Caelyn. He shrugs at the
  bizarre emptiness of his job as a remote worker in the content industry: “I
  log in to the Queue every weekday. It grows and grows, a little like a tree,
  and my job is to lop off as many branches as I can.” His colleagues may be
  human; he rather suspects they’re not. The erosion of the boundary between the
  human and the machine is unsettling but he gets on with things, doesn’t
  overreact. When Bren and Caelyn hear rumours of people standing still in
  fields who insist they are trees, it’s fearless Caelyn who is drawn to them.
  The couple meet a community of “hopefuls”, people who are trying to “dig in”
  and grow roots, and “caretakers” who tend the saplings. This encounter sets
  Caelyn on a path of research that leads, over the decades charted in the
  novel, to her being a roving international expert on arborescence, which is to
  say, on people turning into trees. This plant-human hybridity challenges Bren
  and Caelyn’s ideas of what it is to be human just as intensely as robots,
  driverless cars and AI do. Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture
  and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Bren strives to support
  Caelyn, even when her academic colleagues deride her work – and yet he
  initially struggles to believe in arborescence. In the first stretch of the
  novel, the reader might share his scepticism. Where is the evidence? Is this a
  novel about delusion and despair in a time of crisis? Yes, but it is also a
  novel about people deciding to relinquish their warm animal bodies and turn
  into trees; when Bren stops doubting, the reader is given no choice but to
  accede to the weird and melancholy reality of Arborescence. It’s an encounter
  with an oak tree that shakes Bren out of scepticism. He’s told this tree was
  once a young man called Oscar, and to his surprise, he believes it: “I don’t
  know why or how I know, but I know. This is not just a tree.” This is a
  typical example of the unshowy narrative style of Arborescence. Bren’s
  laconicism gets a bit flat now and then but it’s an effective counter to the
  strangeness he witnesses. The pace of the novel accelerates not long after
  Bren and Caelyn meet Oscar, as arborescence becomes not just common, but
  widespread. People plant themselves in roads and public gardens, on rooftops
  and in their back yards. At public events, Caelyn reassures bereft audiences
  whose families and friends have planted themselves: arborescent individuals
  “seek to extend their lives without unbalancing the planet further”. Time
  passes and new losses and questions accumulate, as folks struggle to grieve
  their loved ones who have dug in. Where does the humanity of these arboresced
  individuals lie? Is standing still and becoming a tree really, as a caretaker
  named Mika tells Caelyn, “a better way to be part of the earth”? Bren and
  Caelyn’s answers to these questions change over the course of the novel. If
  arborescence struck Caelyn and many others initially as a gesture of hope, it
  comes to look like acquiescence. Arborescence is a novel full of such earnest
  questions, an invitation to meditate on what it is to be human in this time of
  human-induced climate change. Davis treads lightly and respectfully around the
  topic of land rights and colonialism – perhaps too lightly. To dig in and
  become a tree wherever one pleases upends received notions of property rights
  and imagines a new form of connection to land. I would have welcomed more
  reflection on what it might mean for so many despairing settlers to lay new
  roots on sovereign Aboriginal land. Humans might be the problem, but
  annihilating them is not the fix proposed by Arborescence. Davis instead holds
  forth the hope of a restored balance between the animal and the vegetal, a
  form of human flourishing under a safe canopy of trees: “There will be a few
  pockets of warm light where small communities remain, still moving, still
  there, still talking, still learning.” The novel closes with a sustaining
  portent of a rehabilitated symbiosis between humans and trees: “I look back at
  the city. One day, it will again be a garden. It is as inevitable as it will
  be beautiful.” Arborescence by Rhett Davis is out now through Hachette
  ($32.99)
