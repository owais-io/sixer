  The Birthday Party review – Willem Dafoe is the life and soul as menacing
  Onassis-alike
sectionName: Film

bodyText: >-
  Willem Dafoe brings star wattage to this watchable drama, playing brooding
  Greek plutocrat and alpha-patriarch Marcos Timoleon, transparently based on
  Aristotle Onassis: gazing impassively at people through his heavy glasses,
  doting menacingly on his dependents and given to exercising in the nude in
  front of the servants. Spanish film-maker Miguel Ángel Jiménez directs and
  co-writes this adaptation of the novel by Panos Karnezis. Bringing star power
  also is charismatic Danish star Vic Carmen Sonne; she plays his daughter
  Sofia, who has the honour and the terrible burden of a massive 25th birthday
  party thrown for her by the overbearing Marcos on his private island. The
  guest list consists almost entirely of his heavily tanned Eurotrash
  acquaintances and hangers-on, but this claustrophobic party is all the more
  painful as (like Onassis) Timoleon has recently suffered the terrible anguish
  of his son and favourite child dying in a plane accident. The film shows us
  that he concerns himself now with who Sofia is to marry and who his son-in-law
  is therefore to be – questions that, if his son had lived, would not be nearly
  so important – and he is nettled to see a close relationship between Sofia and
  his young English biographer Ian Forster, played by Joe Cole. In his heart, of
  course, Marcos would have preferred the other child to die and he has terrible
  plans for Sofia at the end of her party. This is a strong, confident picture
  that hits its measured stride early on. Its pace and style and language are
  dictated by a charismatic Dafoe; however, he gives the impression that this
  performance is not exactly a stretch for him. But he is always commanding,
  especially when talking to his various consiglieri, confiding amusingly to one
  intimate that it is good that children become rebellious and disagreeable; if
  they stayed as adorable as when they were young, parents could never part with
  them. • The Birthday Party screened at the Locarno film festival.
