  All I learned from Nick Clegg’s interview (‘If the people who ran Facebook
  were monsters, I wouldn’t have worked there’: Nick Clegg on tech bros, Trump
  and leaving Silicon Valley, 23 August) is (a) his fawning homage to his former
  boss means that he is keeping his career options open and (b) he still doesn’t
  get why people despise him for his role in the coalition government.
  Zuckerberg, Cameron and Osborne may not be monsters, but the real harms they
  have wrought and their lack of any kind of accountability, responsibility or
  contrition are truly monstrous. Simon Collin Yate, Gloucestershire • A letter
  (22 August) perpetuates the claim that Angela Rayner is bent on selling off
  allotments for development. It isn’t true, as is clear from a close reading of
  your 5 August article, which unfortunately had the unhelpful headline “Jeremy
  Corbyn warns rules on council asset sales threaten allotments”. They don’t,
  they haven’t been changed, and sales have actually fallen slightly. Steve
  Loveman Sheffield • Why did you publish the summer bank holiday jumbo
  crossword, for elite cruciverbalists, in the paper (23 August) and relegate
  the usual prize grid, for mere mortals, to online? Saturday afternoon in the
  pub ruined – thanks for nothing. Glenn Hackney Stratford-upon-Avon, West
  Midlands • Another irritating prefix used by politicians (Letters, 27 August)
  is “let me be clear” – usually followed by obfuscation. Karen Fletcher North
  Anston, South Yorkshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the
  Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be considered for
  publication in our letters section.
