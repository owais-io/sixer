  There is a moment on our first evening at the Beekse Bergen safari resort that
  stops us all dead in our tracks. The kids are wearing the khaki safari hats
  from the welcome packs left on their wooden bunk beds, and we are relaxing on
  the veranda of our hotel room, with panoramic views of the “savannah”. From
  this elevated position, we’re studying our neighbours on this 10-day holiday
  in the south of the Netherlands: Nubian giraffes, white rhinos, antelope,
  zebras and ostriches, all intermingling on the plain, metres in front of us.
  The light is fading and a heatwave is enhancing the African theme of Beekse
  Bergen. In the humidity, our impromptu animal quiz, aided by our in-room
  brochure, is halted by a low, menacing rumble. It takes a moment for context
  to overtake common sense. The thunder we think we’re hearing is actually the
  roar from the pack of lions that live just behind our accommodation. We all
  fall silent, absorbing one of the primal sounds of nature. It may seem like an
  unusual place for a safari – close to the modest city of Tilburg and 20 miles
  west of industrial Eindhoven – but this is a safari holiday Netherlands-style,
  where you don’t have to fly to Africa to get close to our planet’s most
  impressive mammals. The 120-hectare resort is a group of interconnected sites,
  comprising a hotel, lodges, chalets and cottages overlooking several open
  plains full of wildlife; the safari park, which guests can explore on foot
  through a connecting gate from the resort; a lakeside resort with a beach,
  more lodges and a campsite for all budgets; and the Speelland theme park –
  with indoor and outdoor rides, slides and games. The resort has strong
  conservation credentials, with many species that are designated “vulnerable”
  or “extinct in the wild” protected here as part of a Europe-wide network of
  more than 300 zoos, aquariums and parks, including Chester Zoo in the UK. The
  rangers tell us that all the animals living in Beekse Bergen were born here or
  moved to the park from another zoo; none were taken from the wild. The Dutch
  have a particular, tailored approach to family holidays, designing
  thoughtfully for children but without compromising on aesthetic and luxurious
  touches for adults, and Beekse Bergen is no exception – it’s a hit with our
  seven-and 11-year-olds, and us parents, too. Custom-made bunk beds in one
  room, a picture window with views of the animals while soaking in the bath in
  another: attention to detail and lots to keep the kids entertained. For anyone
  staying, there is free unlimited access to the enormous safari park by car,
  bus or – our favourite – walking trails. Unlike a single costly trip to a
  regular zoo, we can make repeat visits to enjoy as many of the 100-plus animal
  species as we can, and at our own pace. Highlights include a magnificent Amur
  (Siberian) tiger, freestyling ring-tailed lemurs shrieking close above our
  heads, blustering rhinos locking horns over food, and the quiet grace of the
  African elephant families. Small “ferry” boats with guided tours (in Dutch)
  take passengers from zone to zone, via lakes where we get a rare sighting of
  two iridescent kingfishers – a personal highlight among the more spectacular
  beasts. By the end of our stay, a battered map covered in ballpoint pen ticks
  is hard evidence of two children brimming with memories. We love the birds of
  prey display, with vultures, eagles, owls and storks swooping low over our
  heads, catching food thrown for them in mid-air. There are scheduled
  lion-feeding sessions and we stumble across the seals’ mealtime, laughing as
  the three blubbery mammals wriggle comically out of the lake and on to the
  sand. For an extra €17.50 (£15) per person, there is also the option of a
  45-minute “game drive” with a guide – ours is the excellent Eva – to get up
  close and personal, away from the main car trails. We meet alpha male giraffe
  Jim and his harem, and as the herd licks the roof of our cruiser with their
  giant tongues, our amazed seven-year-old clicks her camera over and over
  again. It’s easy to spend a week or more here, exploring every corner of the
  complex, ticking off animals in the safari park, swimming in the indoor pool
  and riding bikes (available to hire on site) to the playgrounds. Evenings are
  for indoor bowling, eating at one of multiple restaurants or relaxing back in
  the lodge. We visit the Speelland theme park a couple of times – a brilliantly
  wholesome outdoor and indoor activity centre with fairground-style rides,
  pedalos in the lake, go-karts and bouncy castles. We pop into nearby Tilburg
  (15 minutes by car; 25 minutes on a bike) for takeaway pizza, grocery shopping
  and a day perusing the shops and markets, visiting a traditional Dutch pancake
  house for lunch. There’s also time for a day trip to Amsterdam (less than 90
  minutes by train from Tilburg), where we wander over the canal bridges,
  meander along beautiful streets with vintage antique stores and hop on and off
  the tram. Our youngest decides she wants to move to the pretty Dutch capital
  so she can ride her bike to work every day. Back at the park, we split our
  stay between the hotel and the resort. Our first few days are in one of the
  hotel’s Savanne rooms, geared to guests who want to eat at the resort’s many à
  la carte, buffet or fine dining restaurants. We then move to a Savanne lodge
  at the “top” of the safari resort, with a view of the bigger “Masai Mara
  plain”. The detached lodges are more spacious with full kitchens, ideal for
  self-catering families. Some even have saunas. While there is a small grocery
  shop on site, nearby Tilburg has plenty of supermarkets to stock up at. Our
  tip would be to budget for the significant additional cost of breakfast, lunch
  and dinner if you stay at the hotel. While the veranda view of the plain from
  our first hotel room is spectacular, the additional cost of eating out makes
  the self-catering lodge much more affordable. Is there a specific age where
  our fascination with animals dims, before being reignited as a parent? I would
  say for any child pre-secondary school – before the self-conscious cynicism
  and underwhelmed eye-rolls kick in – Beekse Bergen is a remarkable family
  holiday, especially for those interested in the natural world. “A safari in
  the Netherlands?” your friends will ask, intrigued and maybe a little
  sceptical: “How does that work?” As ever, with Dutch family vacations, it just
  does. The trip was provided by Little Clogs Holidays and Beekse Bergen safari
  resort. A seven-night lodge stay for two adults and two children starts at
  €1,731 (£1,500), including tourist taxes
