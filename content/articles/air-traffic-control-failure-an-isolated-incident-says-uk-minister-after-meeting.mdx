  A radar-related technical failure that led to hundreds of flights being
  disrupted on Wednesday was an “isolated event” with “no evidence of malign
  activity”, the transport secretary has said, after summoning the head of the
  UK air traffic control service, Nats, to account for the disruption. Heidi
  Alexander said she met Martin Rolfe, the under-fire chief executive of Nats,
  to understand what happened and what could be done to prevent a reoccurrence
  in the future after more than 150 flights were cancelled and others delayed by
  the latest glitch. It is understood that Alexander did not press Rolfe to
  consider his position, despite fresh calls from Ryanair for him to quit. Most
  of the disruption from the brief stoppage came at Heathrow. A total of 84
  departures and 71 arrivals were cancelled by 10pm on Wednesday, and some
  inbound flights were diverted to European cities. A small number of British
  Airways flights were cancelled on Thursday owing to aircraft and crew being
  out of position, contributing to at least 16 cancellations to and from
  Heathrow. Heathrow and Gatwick airports said they had resumed normal
  operations. The stoppage was the second to have happened as a result of a
  technical fault at Nats’ Swanwick control centre in two years, although the
  duration was far shorter and the disruption far less severe than the 2023
  August bank holiday failure. In a post on X on Thursday morning, Alexander
  said: “I have spoken with Nats CEO Martin Rolfe who provided further detail on
  yesterday’s technical fault. This was an isolated event and there is no
  evidence of malign activity. I know that any disruption is frustrating for
  passengers. Flights are now resumed and I am grateful to airlines who are
  working hard to get people to where they need to be.” She said passengers
  should continue to check with airlines before travelling. A spokesperson for
  Nats said: “This was a radar-related issue, which was resolved by quickly
  switching to the back-up system during which time we reduced traffic to ensure
  safety.” The stoppage, announced at about 4pm on Wednesday, is believed to
  have lasted about 20 minutes, and within an hour Nats said systems were fully
  operational and that departures had resumed at all airports. Ryanair called on
  Rolfe to resign after the fault, claiming that no lessons had been learned
  since the August 2023 system outage. It is the third time in a month that the
  airline has called for him to go, in a long campaign waged against Nats and
  air traffic control services more widely. The business minister Gareth Thomas,
  asked on Thursday whether Rolfe would be fired over the incident, told Times
  Radio: “Clearly, an incident happened two years ago and measures were taken
  then. It looks like those measures weren’t enough but we need to get to the
  bottom of what exactly happened, and conversations will take place today.”
  Graham Lake, a former director general of the air traffic management industry
  association Canso, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think it’s
  unrealistic to expect a system where you have no technical failure. The
  failure yesterday was short and sweet, the recovery was quick – aircraft were
  operating again very, very quickly.”
