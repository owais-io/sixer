  Nothing does irony quite like Test cricket. Say what you like about the
  world’s most desiccated, Miss Havisham-ish team sport, out there trailing
  around the post-colonial world still dressed in its yellowing wedding dress.
  It’s definitely got a sense of humour. On day one of the fifth England-India
  Test this was expressed in cosmic terms, and a single bold and improbable
  dramatic arc. Talk about groundsmen a lot. Tell groundsmen they’re nothing.
  One thing is for sure. You’re going to find yourself spending quite a lot of
  time watching groundsmen. Or in this case watching the personage we must now
  refer to as controversial groundsman Lee Fortis, celebrity Oval pitch curator
  Lee Fortis, an otherwise peripheral figure with a name that sounds like an
  Anglo-Saxon burial site in Norfolk, but who was promoted in the buildup to
  this Test into an instrument of the sporting-political power struggle. And so
  it came to pass in the first two sessions at the Oval, as India and England
  traipsed on and off between the showers, and Fortis loomed, somehow
  inevitably, centre stage. Here is Lee Fortis striding about his domain in
  classic shorts and boots combos, like a proud, captive bear. Here is Lee
  Fortis tugging at a tarpaulin. Here is Lee Fortis all alone in his lime green
  field as the drizzle fell and the walkways around the ground took on the feel
  of a slowly sinking ship peopled only by pint-sozzled mariners in chino
  shorts, and watched from behind the plateglass by his chief adversary, India’s
  head coach, Gautam Gambhir. In a Test series shot through with politics,
  rumblings and noises off, they’ve finally dragged in the bloke with the rake.
  Welcome to the Fortis-verse. It is the most unlikely turn of events. Fortis is
  familiar figure around here, a huge ambling man with the classic groundsman’s
  shape, as though he’s been hinged together out of sacks of cement and packed
  into a pair of shorts. Who thinks of the groundsman? What are they? They sit
  on mowers. They walk with sawdust buckets. They follow the seasons, disturbed
  only by their personal kryptonite, people walking near a rope, signal for
  instant and uncontainable explosions of boggle-eyed fury. And yet, look a
  little closer, squint at the magic eye picture, and something else has begun
  to emerge here, the groundsman as instrument of power and conspiracy. By 2pm
  on Thursday afternoon, 48 hours on from that unnecessary spat with Gambhir,
  Fortis had been memed and replicated and spun out across the global hive mind.
  Oval curator breaks silence. Fortis v Gambhir: the full story. Who is Lee
  Fortis and what does he mean? There are Fortis YouTube clips (jerky spat
  footage; weird ad hoc media huddle) that have been viewed two million times.
  Lee Fortis stuns fans with body transformation. This simple Lee Fortis trick
  will change your life for ever. Seventeen times Lee Fortis broke the internet
  (No 12 will shock you!) More fuel was added overnight as R Ashwin labelled
  Fortis a habitual offender. Really? It’s not the first time he’s yelled at
  people to get off his square? You shock me. Meanwhile, the groundsman
  community has sprung to his defence, a Facebook page speaking for this
  maligned minority demanding respect, understanding, a safe space for its
  members. What next? A Fortis spin-off vehicle. The Fortis origins story. A
  Fortis male grooming range. Jake Paul calls out Lee Fortis in sensational
  Vegas standoff. Or perhaps it won’t come to that. Because this is at the same
  time absolutely nothing, chaff, gossip, and also a grim little episode that
  reflects poorly on Gambhir in particular; and perhaps also on the general
  power dynamics of elite cricket in its current form. The initial incident was
  a standard stramash over practising too close, or so Fortis said, to the
  square. Gambhir’s response was furious. Any situation where you end up wagging
  a finger and shouting, “You’re nothing, you’re just a groundsman, nothing
  beyond that,” is one that has lost any sense of scale. Later Fortis was
  swarmed by Indian journalists and gave the greatest no comment interview of
  all time, unveiling a technique that should be urgently coached to all
  celebrities and politicians, which basically involves just saying “I’m not ...
  You’re not ... I’m not really,” to every question. It is a fairly simple
  divvying up at this point. Gambhir was always in the wrong here. First because
  all groundsmen are grumpy. They have to venerate, love and fetishise this
  patch of green. They have the artist’s temperament. They feel the hand of
  history. They basically just want you to stay off their square and stop
  playing cricket. But mainly Gambhir was wrong because of the ugliness of his
  choice of words, and the sense of punching down. England got to show their
  boorishness in Manchester. This was India’s turn. India’s coach is a
  born-to-rule type, high caste Hindu, private schoolboy, son of a wealthy
  industrialist, BJP politician, a Jay Shah man, a Modi guy. It sits a little
  uncomfortably to hear anyone with such privilege dismissing a bloke with a
  bucket as “nothing”, unqualified to make demands of his betters. In this
  context Gambhir v Fortis speaks, if you choose to see it, to the way India
  wields its commercial and political power in this sport; to the sense that
  here is an overlord nation that can basically do what it wants, that is in
  effect untouchable. This is the most unfavourable version of events. More
  prosaically Gambhir does just love a fight, is essentially a grudge in a cap,
  outspoken and commendably feisty. In a happier turn there was at least a kind
  of rapprochement at the start of play between Fortis and India’s players, a
  little wary banter and some smiles. After which, once the showers had cleared,
  it was a case of the groundsman’s revenge, as Gambhir got to watch India’s
  batters sparring and hopping and nicking as the ball leapt and jagged about on
  Fortis’ chosen strip. England’s pace attack had looked rusty at the start,
  both Jamie Overton and Josh Tongue perhaps paying tribute the 2.5m distance
  rule by almost missing the cut part of the pitch. But they chipped away and
  found movement. Shubman Gill had batted with sculpted elegance, all perfect
  arms, shoulders, lines, balletic in the way he shifts his weight, then ran
  himself out trying to take a single to Gus Atkinson’s right hand in his follow
  through. With India on 204 for six at the end of play the series already felt
  a little safer. Hopefully the age of Lee is also done. Andy Warhol would later
  revise his most famous line to the more depressingly accurate “in 15 minutes
  everyone will be famous”. Fortis had his day in the gloom. With any luck hands
  will now be shaken, an unpleasant tone revised, and the whole thing can be
  safely packed away in the shed behind the pigeon nets.
