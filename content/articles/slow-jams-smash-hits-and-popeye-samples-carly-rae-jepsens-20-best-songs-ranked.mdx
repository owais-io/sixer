  20. Anything to Be With You (2023) Carly Rae Jepsen loves to squirrel away
  killer songs for her now-standard B-side collections. The opener to The
  Loveliest Time (the companion to 2022’s The Loneliest Time) evinces several
  CRJ trademarks: a love of odd production in the drily funky guitar and playful
  percussion, breathy falsetto – and obsessive, intense lyrics about being
  willing to do anything for love. 19. This Kiss (2012) You can plot Jepsen
  songs on a spectrum of “laser-eyed intensity” to “dreamy reverie”. This Kiss,
  from her first pop album Kiss (after her dreary post-Canadian Idol debut,
  2008’s Tug of War), epitomises the former, with EDM-era synths that rattle and
  gleam like arcade machines and a sledgehammer vocal performance about wanting
  forbidden pleasures. 18. Cry (2016) CRJ is a fiend for pure sensation who
  literally called an album Emotion: often her lyrics skip over any specific
  object of affection and cut straight to the feeling, as a song later in this
  list spells out. So when she sings “he never wants to strip down to his
  feelings” on this pained ballad from Emotion Side B, you know it’s terminal.
  17. No Drug Like Me (2019) Anyone who’s only ever heard the radioactively
  perky Call Me Maybe and (wrongly) considers CRJ a one-hit wonder might be
  stunned to learn that she’s elite at genuinely sultry come-ons. No Drug Like
  Me lives up to its narcotic premise – a risky cliche to sell – with its
  slinky, muted boogie and Jepsen’s gasped promises to “blossom for you”. 16.
  All That (2015) Avant garde collaborators love Jepsen, but unlike, say,
  Caroline Polachek or Charli xcx, she’s never made leftfield cool her brand.
  Those moments feel more like surprise gems in her enjoyably wayward catalogue:
  All That, made with Ariel Rechtshaid and Dev Hynes, is a sparkling devotional
  that forms a perfect period trifecta with Sky Ferreira’s Everything Is
  Embarrassing and Solange’s Losing You. 15. Joshua Tree (2022) The verse to
  Joshua Tree is all sharp, hungry anticipation of – what else – some kind of
  sensory high. Jepsen makes it worth the wait when the tension breaks into a
  chorus of rapturous satisfaction, à la Jessie Ware’s sultrier disco moments:
  “I need it / I feel it,” Jeppo sings, her unusually fragmentary lyrics evoking
  the strobe-lit half-memories of an ecstatic night out. 14. Boy Problems (2015)
  The cutely funky Boy Problems solidified CRJ’s gay icon status – you’ll seldom
  see a crowd yell louder than when she sings, “Boy problems, who’s got ’em?” –
  and gave the concept a self-aware spin, acknowledging how bored her friends
  are of hearing about her messy love life. The sing-songy chorus sends up her
  predicament and is totally addictive. 13. Tiny Little Bows (2012) Intended for
  Jepsen’s scrapped second album Curiosity, Tiny Little Bows got a glow-up from
  its coffee shop-pop demo to the machine-tooled whirling strings and snapping
  bass of its incarnation on Kiss. The lyric about chasing Cupid and his dinky
  arrow makes little sense (how do you think it goes with those tiny little
  bows? Err, fiddly?) yet hits like the best of Scandi-pop nonsense. 12.
  Everything He Needs (2019) CRJ had failed to clear this song’s sample of He
  Needs Me, from Disney’s 1980 Popeye film. So, naturally, she went to
  Disneyland and got Mickey Mouse to sign a fake contract approving it, then
  sent it to the publishers: “The big star boss says it’s OK.” They relented,
  and thank god, otherwise this slice of flirty madness, with its chorus that
  ascends like a starlet climbing a light-up staircase on a TV special, would
  never have existed. 11. Gimmie Love (2015) “‘Cause I want what I want / Do you
  think that I want too much?” could be the Jeppo MO. On Gimmie Love, she lunges
  for, then suddenly withdraws from her crush, scared by the enormity of the
  feeling. It echoes within the cavernous, bass-wobbling production, offset by
  her effervescent vocals – and a determined cheerleader chant pivot in the
  middle eight. 10. Julien (2019) No stranger to gothic intensity, Jepsen sings
  that she’s “forever haunted by our time” on this sleek, sumptuous recollection
  of a formative romance. It was originally written for a scrapped disco album,
  its cool bass and enveloping sparkle hinting at a student of the French touch
  sound. 9. The Sound (2019) The Sound offers a rarity in the Jeppo catalogue:
  unequivocal exasperation, anger flashing as she rebukes an unpredictable
  lover. “Love is more than telling me you want it,” she sings over an abrupt
  beat, craving – once again – the feeling. The tender piano in the verses
  drives home what she’s missing. 8. Want You in My Room (2019) Not to accuse
  co-producer Jack Antonoff of recycling, but this song’s bass/percussion intro
  very much recalls his work on Lorde’s Hard Feelings/Loveless. Anyway, it sets
  up a fantastically feral CRJ moment: “I wanna do bad things to you!” she
  rhapsodises, with teeth-baring pep to rival early Madonna and robotic zip out
  of the Daft Punk playbook. 7. Western Wind (2022) Jepsen’s lead singles have
  sometimes failed to recreate former glories: see Call Me Maybe redux I Really
  Like You, a red herring for the depth of Emotion. But for the first taste of
  The Loneliest Time, she ditched her bangers-first approach for this gorgeous,
  dusky Rostam collab, a pandemic rumination on memory. 6. Charli xcx – Backseat
  (ft Carly Rae Jepsen) (2017) Charli has form for drawing out unexpected sides
  of well-known artists, and the first taste of mixtape Pop 2 showed off an
  unusually, captivatingly desolate CRJ. The pair spun a tale of powerless
  self-sabotage in relationships, their Auto-Tuned voices fluttering “all alone,
  all alone, all alone” over AG Cook and Easyfun’s tweaky ghost-in-the-machine
  ballad. 5. Shy Boy (2023) Jepsen may be as good a successor to Kylie as we’ve
  ever had: a beloved, benign pop presence with an endless thirst for cheeky
  disco. Shy Boy is Minogue-worthy: a commanding, tart invitation to the
  dancefloor, although CRJ fabulously overplays her hand in a wordy bridge that
  reveals just how frazzled desire has left her. 4. Cut to the Feeling (2017)
  One billion times better than a song written for an animated kids’ film about
  a ballerina should be, Cut to the Feeling is raw Jepsen id: she’s sticking her
  hand straight in the socket of desire, and conducting it through the rowdy,
  euphoric chorus, written at peak leaping-around tempo. It’s basically Run Away
  with Me 2.0, but this is a song about overcoming reason, so just give in to
  it. 3. Call Me Maybe (2012) The first time I heard Call Me Maybe I thought it
  “wasn’t that catchy”. Like biting into a chilli and declaring it “not very
  spicy”, only to be left weeping and demanding pints of milk, its delirious
  strings, pogoing beat and Carly’s nuclear-force yet endearingly innocent crush
  got the better of me. And rightly so. 2. Run Away With Me (2015) Emotion
  arrived a year after Taylor Swift’s 1989, the latter laden with lyrical Easter
  eggs that clearly identified her songs’ subjects. Emotion hit certain
  listeners hard because it felt so free from subtext, hungering instead for BIG
  FEELINGS shot straight to the heart. The brazen sax and “oh-oh-whoa / OH-OH
  WHOA!” of RAWM are a direct hit. 1. Warm Blood (2015) The moment a crush
  becomes reality is rare and beautiful. Often, it simply never happens. If it
  does turn into a relationship, that moment of tingling anticipation can still
  only happen once. Here, Jepsen and Rostam precisely capture the feverishness
  of finally being so close to someone’s face, you can feel their breath. Their
  subtle rapture softens the arpeggiated judder of Robyn’s Call Your Girlfriend
  into a beat that rushes like adrenaline, the song’s body heat contrasting the
  parched desperation in Jepsen’s voice. It skips the cathartic peak of many of
  her hits to circle this precious feeling, willing it to last as long as
  possible.
