  I have a problem. It has spanned many years, cost me hundreds of pounds and
  earned the derision – and concern – of friends and family. Don’t worry: it
  isn’t anything sordid but it does give me an absurd number of ways to cook
  chicken or use up a bag of potatoes. My poison is Ninja appliances. Anyone who
  walks into my tiny kitchen is taken aback by my extensive collection. My
  prized trio are the Foodi, the Foodi Max Health Grill and Air Fryer and the
  Creami, which collectively give me the ability to air-fry, grill, sear, roast,
  pressure-cook, slow-cook, steam or even dehydrate my dinner, and transform a
  frozen mishmash of protein powder, yoghurt and sweeteners into an
  ice-cream-like dessert. It doesn’t stop there. I also own a Ninja blender,
  food processor and hand blender. While less flashy, they have survived my
  unwise attempts to mince a fully intact topside of beef and turn avocado
  stones into “detox dust” for an ill-fated “glow-up” smoothie. I am far from
  the only person who has been taken in by Ninja fever. Global sales of its
  products reached almost $2.9bn in 2024, a 38% jump from nearly $2.1bn the year
  before. With more than 50 Ninja kitchen products available in Britain, the UK
  is now the second largest market for their maker, the US-based appliance
  company SharkNinja. It is a remarkable feat considering that a decade ago the
  brand was nearly unknown in the UK. It was the air fryer that changed that,
  particularly the two-drawer food crisper, which hit the shops in 2020.
  Launching at £179.99 in the UK ($179.99 in the US), it was swiftly stocked in
  high-street big hitters including Argos and John Lewis. It soon took the UK,
  and the world, by storm. In 2023, John Lewis named the Ninja air fryer as one
  of its “products of the decade”. On Amazon, Ninja’s products dominate the
  air-fryer bestsellers charts, holding four of the top five spots in the UK and
  the US. Ninja’s next mega-success was the Creami, which promises to turn a tub
  filled with ingredients of your choosing into a creamy, cold dessert. It
  launched in 2021 in the US at $179.99 and soon became a viral hit on social
  media. By 2022, Ninja claimed it was America’s “No 1 ice-cream maker”, based
  on sales data from market research firm NPD Group. On TikTok, the hashtag
  “#ninjacreami” has 244m views as people have flocked to the platform to show
  off their recipes. Strained yoghurt and fruits are common options, but others
  have opted for more off-piste creations, including a baked bean “ice-cream”.
  The Ninja Slushi (£349.99 in the UK, $349.99 in the US), which allows you to
  make slushies and cocktails at home, is the brand’s latest success, selling
  out 15 times on its release in the US. On the back of that hit, SharkNinja was
  this year named as one of Time Magazine’s top 100 companies, joining the likes
  of Netflix and Amazon. The brand has also done a remarkable job of getting
  A-listers to plug its products. Kris Jenner’s Instagram featured a sponsored
  post of her singing the device’s praises. David Beckham is a global brand
  ambassador for Ninja and in one advert showed off some of his own culinary
  quirks – which included using his Ninja Double Stack air fryer (£229.99) to
  cook carrots whole, including the green tops, and using the Woodfire outdoor
  oven (£349.99), which triples up as an oven, pizza oven and BBQ smoker, inside
  his kitchen. Viewers of the film F1: The Movie, starring Brad Pitt, will see
  SharkNinja’s product placement throughout – from its logo stamped on race cars
  to Ninja gadgets on show in swanky kitchens. In an interview with Ad Week in
  March, SharkNinja CEO Mark Barrocas said the company spends much of its $700m
  advertising budget on social media. Influencers play such a strong role in
  promoting the Creami, he said: “We virtually don’t invest any more advertising
  on [it].” The company has also worked hard to get its products in the hands of
  so-called “microinfluencers” who have “great, authentic followings with
  smaller niche groups”. It is, simply, word of mouth for the social media age.
  But this kind of business relies on innovation. SharkNinja pours money into
  research and development, with a budget that rose to $341.3m in 2024, up 37%
  from 2023. It has a team of more than 1,100 engineers and designers in the UK,
  US and China, is typically working on 60 products at any one time and launches
  about 25 new products a year. Some of these are better value than others,
  according to Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?
  “Ninja continues to be a popular brand with customers, and when it comes to
  air fryers, blenders and multicookers, our testing has found that this is
  mostly well deserved,” she says. “However, prices can reach more than £300 so
  it certainly isn’t the cheapest. And if you’re looking for an ice-cream maker
  or mini-oven, we’ve found that there are other brands that perform better and
  cost less, so it’s worth looking elsewhere.” Like me, Rhianne Crozier has a
  kitchen full of Ninja appliances. Her love of the brand started six years ago.
  After she moved into her new home with her husband, her parents gave her a
  Ninja air fryer as housewarming gift. Now she owns more than 10 Ninja gadgets.
  They include the Creami, Slushi, the Luxe Café coffee machine (£549.99) – a
  high-end brewer that allows you to make espressos, cold brews and cafe staples
  such as lattes and cappuccinos – and the Ninja Speedi multicooker (£229.99), a
  combined steamer and air fryer designed for one-pot meals. In total, she has
  spent about £2,000 on Ninja products. The 28-year-old content creator, who
  shows off her dishes on TikTok under the name Home With Rhianne, has two
  children. “I’ve cooked meals in about 15 minutes. It’s great when you’ve got
  hungry kids,” she says. “Before I would stay in the kitchen for hours.” She
  hasn’t touched her pans or oven in months. “It’s more convenient to just put
  it in, close it, take it out. They’re easy to clean afterwards too,” she says.
  But does the success of Ninja tell us something more uncomfortable about how
  we live today? Pen Vogler, author of Scoff: A History of Food and Class in
  Britain, says “these very speedy innovations” are part of a consumer culture
  where “there has to be something new constantly”. My personal journey into
  Ninja-obsession did start with need. When I moved into my small flat, it was
  unfurnished. After buying something to sleep on (my bed) and something to
  watch (my TV), money was too tight to deck out my kitchen with pots, pans and
  baking trays. Instead, I opted for a Ninja Foodi, which set me back just over
  £100. It allowed me to sear, pressure-cook and air-fry my food without having
  to buy loads of extra equipment, and it was much quicker than using the oven.
  I’m not the only person who struggles for space – one study by the University
  of Reading found that the living space of the average private renter in
  Britain shrank from 31 sq metres in 1996 to 25 sq metres in 2017; and families
  are renting increasingly smaller homes as the cost of living soars. Vogler
  says that in the Victorian era, living space was also very tight, and cooking
  gadgets were also enormously popular. She points to Charles Dickens, who in
  his 1841 novel The Old Curiosity Shop described a silver “temple” with four
  chambers. In one, an egg was placed and in another, some coffee was poured.
  Raw steak and water were put in and, after the machine worked its magic,
  “breakfast was ready”. It is, says Vogler, “like a kind of Victorian air
  fryer”. A lack of living space means people will “try to use what technology
  they have available to answer the problems of how to cook. What Ninja is doing
  now is just a continuation of something that has been happening for centuries.
  Technology comes along and it finds a solution to our domestic problems.” What
  started for me as a solution to a space problem soon became something else. I
  became obsessed with the Ninja brand, eagerly following its social media to
  see what device it could bring out to tempt me with next. Recently, however,
  the shine has worn off. While the Slushi has been a sensation, it lacks many
  things that have previously sold me on the brand. Yes, it allows you to make
  slushie drinks and cocktails, but there are major setbacks. It takes at least
  half an hour to produce a drink, lacks that “I can see myself using this every
  day” factor and, most importantly, doesn’t seem to have many health
  advantages, as sugar must be used for most drinks to work in the machine.
  “Health is becoming a really important part of our cooking technology,” says
  Vogler. And Ninja’s success has certainly played on our worries about
  ultra-processed foods. “There’s a large element of anxiety around industrial
  food that is sending people back to try to make it for themselves,” says
  Vogler, which “air fryers and kitchen gadgets will do well from. If people are
  moving back to cooking, they will always want a fast and easy way to do it.”
  Ninja has adapted to 2020s living, but how have the gadgets changed us? Before
  the air fryer, there was the microwave. Both have been accused of tarnishing
  the culinary arts, but Vogler says some of our most beloved dishes were born
  out of new kitchen technology. For her, the air fryer has an unlikely
  relative. “Cast iron ovens first came in about 300 years ago. It was a massive
  new technology and is also when our era of home-baking took off,” she says. It
  ushered in some of our favourite dishes, including eccles cakes and baked
  tarts. Judy Joo, TV chef and owner of the London-based Korean restaurant Seoul
  Bird, says kitchen gadgets can be “great”, but they have limits. “Sometimes
  you just want to cook something the way it was intended,” she says. That
  includes being able to watch what’s going on. With Ninja appliances,
  particularly the air fryers and multi-cookers, you end up shoving something in
  a draw or sealing a lid. For Joo, visibility is key. “You should be able to
  see food cooking and changing versus something that you say goodbye to and
  open up the door once it’s ready,” she says. “You lose control of the cooking
  process.” And, she says, air fryers will never fully replicate something
  deep-fried, like chicken. “It’s a compromise,” she says. “You don’t get things
  as crispy. It’s crispy-ish, but it’s definitely not the same. You could tell
  the difference 100%.” For her, nothing quite beats the kitchen classics,
  particularly the satisfaction of “getting out a regular pot or pan, drizzling
  oil, hearing the sizzle and cracking an egg”. The humble frying pan is much
  more versatile than it’s given credit for, considering you can “glaze, simmer
  and saute” in it, she says. “You can’t deglaze in an air fryer.”
