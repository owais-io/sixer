  The smile on Youri Tielemans’s face widens as he discusses the time Unai Emery
  visited him in Quorn, the Leicestershire village he has called home since
  arriving in England six years ago. “The initial conversation was about my
  ideas as a player, where I wanted to play and how I saw myself and he quite
  liked me because he came back a second time,” Tielemans says, laughing. “It
  was really about understanding each other. And I think we clicked the first
  time we met.” Fast-forward two years and Tielemans, who joined Aston Villa as
  a free agent after leaving Leicester, has established himself as an
  indispensable cog in Emery’s machine. He has been considered a classy
  midfielder since making his Champions League debut for Anderlecht aged 16 and
  has proved a dependable force for Villa, an intelligent operator whether
  sniffing danger or shifting possession. The 28-year-old thinks carefully on
  and off the pitch, valuing sleep and nutrition; he is teetotal and those close
  to him highlight the only fizzy drink he may consume is sparkling water. In
  January, before Tielemans returned to his former club Monaco with Villa in the
  Champions League, Emery said Tielemans’s “best quality is in his mind, his
  mentality”. He is an affable, but private character, laser-focused on family
  and football. He clocked up 60 matches for club and country last season,
  including 52 starts for Villa. The last match was in Brussels in June, a wild
  4-3 World Cup qualifying victory over Wales. Tielemans scored with a sweet
  first-time finish and laid on Kevin De Bruyne with a magnificent cross for
  Belgium’s winner. “I always feel like once I’m in that rhythm, I feel the best
  I can be. When I’m in that rhythm, you just play, recover, play, recover and
  you just get used to it and hopefully I can do that again. “We’re well tracked
  by medical and technical staff – there are a lot of things going on backstage,
  I would say, where you have to just give your body the best chance possible to
  perform.” A marathon campaign called for some downtime with his wife, Mendy,
  and their three daughters, aged eight, five and one. So, what did his summer
  look like? “Just following the kids around, to be honest … that’s a lot of
  work sometimes,” he says, smiling. “But I enjoy it. I just want to be there
  for them, to watch them grow up. It’s the main thing for me as a father. They
  all have their own characters – they’re so different from each other – but
  when we play together it’s just so enjoyable.” Despite a near-flawless run at
  the end of last season – Villa won 10 of their last 11 league matches before a
  final-day trip to Manchester United – hopes of qualifying for the Champions
  League in successive seasons unravelled with defeat at Old Trafford. The worst
  bit for Tielemans was he was watching at home, powerless to influence things
  owing to a calf niggle. “Looking back at last season, there were some games
  where we lost a few points and you think: ‘How on earth did that happen?’
  That’s where this season you want to make sure you don’t lose those stupid
  points. There were a few games where we analysed them back and said to
  ourselves: ‘This can’t happen.’” Tielemans does not pinpoint particular
  matches, but the failure to beat Ipswich and squandering victory against
  Bournemouth at Villa Park with seconds to play left a sour taste. “There were
  a few games where the manager was a bit frustrated that he didn’t have all the
  players available due to injuries and other problems,” he says. “He really
  wants that availability this season to be able to make changes whenever a
  player is tired, because that’s what cost us as well.” It is hard to imagine
  now, but Tielemans had a slow start to life at Villa; the 2023-24 season was
  four months old by the time of his first league start. Emery described
  Tielemans’s first season as an adaptation period. What did Tielemans have to
  change? “It was just that my levels were not good enough at the time,” he
  says. Was that something he acknowledged then? “No, no,” he says, exploding
  into laughter. “Once you’re in it, you don’t realise what’s going on. But,
  looking back, that’s the beauty of life, really; you understand, you try and
  learn from what’s happened. “I don’t think I made any mistakes in that time, I
  was just maybe not good enough to play in that team. The team was performing
  well, winning games,” Tielemans adds, referencing a 15-game winning streak at
  Villa Park that stretched almost the entire calendar year, “so why would the
  manager have changed that team? Then you start understanding: ‘OK, I need to
  perform better, I understand the system better now and now it’s up to me to do
  better.’ I took some time to put the [manager’s] system in my body because
  it’s quite demanding.” Villa have taken enormous strides under Emery. There is
  a natural thirst to evolve, but Tielemans knows from his own experiences it is
  not that straightforward. He suffered relegation with Leicester in 2023, two
  years after his sumptuous strike at Wembley clinched the FA Cup and after
  three successive top‑eight finishes. “You always have to push yourself, you
  have to adapt and tweak tactically, physically as well you have to get better
  because it gets harder every season and you don’t want to get found out in
  your tactics and that’s why you need those tweaks.” Did he feel he had a point
  to prove after leaving Leicester, especially given a highly successful spell
  ended with relegation? “Not particularly because of that, because I always
  have something to prove. I just want to be better every day, so that’s just in
  my mentality. It’s not that I want to prove to anyone anything, I always want
  to push myself, to prove to myself that … yeah, that I’m good.” Tielemans, a
  modest character with more than 600 appearances, is underselling himself. Fans
  will vouch he has been great, not good. The Villa captain, John McGinn,
  described him as their best player “by a mile” last season and Tielemans took
  home the players’ player and supporters’ player of the season awards. He is
  targeting another successful season, starting against Newcastle at Villa Park
  on Saturday lunchtime. “They’re a very good side and to have that kind of game
  as your first game of the season is always nice to get back into it.” Villa’s
  primary focus is the Premier League, but from day one Emery stressed he wanted
  to win silverware and decorate a trophy in claret and blue. At the end of next
  month Villa, whose last triumph was the League Cup in 1996, will start their
  quest in the Europa League, a competition Emery has won on a record four
  occasions. “He wants to win, and that’s why he wants his players to be winners
  as well,” says Tielemans. “We are ambitious, we want to do better than last
  season. We got to the semi-finals against [Crystal] Palace in the FA Cup, and
  it was not good enough on that day. Looking back, it’s something that we
  really want as a team, but it’s a long journey.”
