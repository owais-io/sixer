  A stand-off over the firing of the Susan Monarez, director of the US Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has deepened, with Monarez’s lawyers
  claiming she will not depart unless the president himself removes her.
  Monarez, an infectious disease specialist who was confirmed as CDC chief just
  a month ago, was fired on Wednesday, according to a statement from the
  Department of Health and Human Services, which gave no reason for the
  departure. However, the apparently ousted director has refused to be removed.
  Her lawyers claim that while the White House has said that she is “not aligned
  with the president’s agenda”, only Donald Trump himself can dismiss her. “As a
  presidential appointee, senate confirmed officer, only the president himself
  can fire her,” Monarez’s lawyer Mark Zaid posted on BlueSky. “For this reason,
  we reject notification Dr. Monarez has received as legally deficient and she
  remains as CDC Director. We have notified the White House Counsel of our
  position.” A spokesperson for Trump, Kush Desai, told the New York Times that
  Monarez was “not aligned with the President’s agenda of Making America Healthy
  Again”, and “the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the
  C.D.C.” The decision to remove Monarez has sparked further turmoil within the
  CDC, with four of its other senior leaders also resigning over what they
  condemned as political interference in their work, budget cuts and the spread
  of misinformation under the Trump administration. The CDC is ultimately
  overseen by Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary who is known for
  founding an anti-vaccine group and in his current role has cut funding for
  medical research, removed scientific advisers and on Wednesday restricted the
  use of Covid vaccines for Americans. “First it was independent advisory
  committees and career experts. Then it was the dismissal of seasoned
  scientists. Now, Secretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on
  weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American
  lives at risk,” Monarez’s lawyers said in a statement. “When CDC Director
  Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and
  fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a
  political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.” Monarez and Kennedy
  clashed over vaccine policy, while CDC leaders were angry and upset over how
  the administration handled a deadly situation earlier this month when a gunman
  fired upon the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta, killing a police officer,
  according to the New York Times. The four senior officials to resign from the
  CDC are Debra Houry, the chief medical officer; Daniel Jernigan, the vaccine
  safety chief; Jennifer Layden, head of the office for public health data; and
  Demetre Daskalakis, who ran the office that issues vaccine recommendations.
