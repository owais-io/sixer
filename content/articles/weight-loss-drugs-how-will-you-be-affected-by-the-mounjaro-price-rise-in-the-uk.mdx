  Eli Lilly, the US manufacturer of the weight loss jab Mounjaro, has said the
  price will rise by 170% in the UK. From September, the price of the drug will
  increase with a month’s supply of the highest dose rising from £122 to £330.
  The change comes as Donald Trump ramps up pressure on drugmakers to increase
  their prices for Europeans so that they can make them more affordable for
  Americans. We’d like to hear from people who use Mounjaro and how the change
  in cost might affect them. Have you explored switching to a different
  medication? Are you worried you will have to stop and might put weight back
  on? If you’re having trouble using the form click here. Read terms of service
