  In Plaza Murillo, the heart of Bolivia’s political capital, La Paz – and home
  to the presidential palace, parliament and the country’s main Catholic
  cathedral – time may be running out for a clock that runs backwards. Installed
  atop of the congressional palace during the years of prosperity under former
  president Evo Morales, 65, the anti-clockwise timepiece was conceived as a
  symbol of the “decolonial and anti-imperialist” worldview championed by the
  left. But it has since become an emblem of the decline of Morales’s Movimiento
  al Socialismo (Mas) party – with some saying that, as the country faces its
  worst economic crisis in 40 years, Bolivia itself has been moving backwards.
  And when 7.9 million Bolivians head to the polls this Sunday to choose their
  next president, Mas not only risks losing power after nearly 20 years – but it
  could disappear as a political force altogether. Polls point to a potential
  runoff between two rightwing candidates: the centre-right business tycoon and
  former planning minister Samuel Doria Medina, 66, followed closely by Jorge
  “Tuto” Quiroga, 65, a rightwing former president who briefly led the country
  in 2001 after the resignation of the former dictator Hugo Banzer. The deeply
  unpopular current president, Luis Arce – a former finance minister under
  Morales who wrested control of Mas from his former mentor – opted not to seek
  re-election and instead nominated his 36-year-old minister of government,
  Eduardo del Castillo. Unlike previous elections in which Morales and then Arce
  secured outright first-round victories with over 50% of the vote, Del Castillo
  is now polling below 3%, the minimum threshold for a party to remain eligible
  to contest future elections. “Arce will go down in history as the one who
  buried the ‘father’, seized the party and, in all likelihood, led it to its
  end,” said the political and economic analyst Gonzalo Chávez Alvarez, a
  professor at the Universidad Católica Boliviana. Although polling in Bolivia
  has historically proved unreliable, the prospect of a party that was once
  hegemonic now teetering on the brink of oblivion is anything but trivial. “I
  can bet we won’t lose our legal status,” Arce told the Guardian late on
  Thursday, arguing that polls failed to predict his first-round victory in
  2020. Even so, the president showed little confidence in any surprise from the
  left and said he would respect the result if the right won. “If they are
  democratically elected, why not accept it?” he said. “And we will mobilise to
  resist, to be the opposition, of course.” “I had high hopes for this
  government but now I only feel disappointment,” said Pablo Quispe, 55, who has
  sold hats for the past 25 years in a street market in El Alto – a booming
  high-altitude city near La Paz that was once a Mas stronghold. After years of
  prosperity driven by a natural gas boom, reserves dwindled during the final
  years of Morales’s presidency, triggering an economic crisis that has deepened
  ever since. “The gas that should have sustained the country for much longer –
  and then generated resources to be invested in other sectors, diversifying the
  economy – wasn’t used that way,” said Alvarez. Under Arce, the economy has
  deteriorated further: by July 2025, annual inflation had reached 24.8%, the
  highest level since at least 2008. Just as Bolivia celebrates 200 years of
  independence, there are shortages of fuel and US dollars, leading to
  scarcities and long queues even for bread. “Everything is more expensive, and
  we’re barely getting by,” said Quispe, who previously voted for Mas but now
  plans to vote for Medina because “the left just isn’t working any more”.
  Leticia Guarachi Padilla, a 35-year-old leftist entrepreneur who runs a small
  business installing blinds and curtains, plans to spoil her ballot in protest
  over Morales’s exclusion from the race. The first Indigenous president in
  Bolivia’s history and the country’s longest-serving leader, from 2006 to 2019,
  Morales was barred by the constitutional court, which ruled that he has
  already exceeded the two-term limit, and the electoral court, which has argued
  that his party is not formally registered. Since October, he has remained
  entrenched in central Bolivia, where hundreds of coca farmers have prevented
  police from executing an arrest warrant issued against him over allegations
  that he fathered a child with a 15-year-old while in office. In recent weeks,
  Morales has urged supporters to cast blank votes – claiming that if the number
  of spoiled ballots exceeds the share won by the top candidate, it would mean
  he had won. The highest-polling leftwing name is that of Andrónico Rodríguez,
  a 36-year-old senator, polling third to fifth. Once seen as Morales’s natural
  heir due to his Indigenous roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union,
  Rodríguez was labelled a traitor by his former mentor after deciding to launch
  his own candidacy and has seemed unable to rally support from the fragmented
  left. “I voted for Evo every time he ran, and I don’t regret it because he
  promoted structural changes that favoured the poorest,” said Padilla, who
  acknowledged the former president’s “problems”, including “his relationships
  with underage girls and the fact that he sees himself as a saviour, driven
  more by ego”. But she still believes he should have run. “Voting for Doria or
  Quiroga means voting for imperialism and for the US to retake control of
  Bolivia,” she said. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote, or at
  least 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, a second round will be held
  on 19 October, which would be unprecedented in the country’s history. Doria
  Medina and Quiroga are running for the fourth time, but still present
  themselves as political outsiders. Both advocate spending cuts as their main
  strategy to tackle the economic crisis. Quiroga says he would prioritise
  relations with the United States, while Doria Medina has promised to restore
  the supply of dollars and fuel within 100 days. His campaign slogan is “100
  días, carajo” (100 days, dammit), a reference not to the Argentine president
  Javier Milei’s libertarian rallying cry “Viva la libertad, carajo!” (Long live
  freedom, dammit!), but to the 2005 plane crash Doria Medina survived, after
  which he said: “Carajo, no me puedo morir” (I can’t die, dammit!). Riding a
  motorbike decorated with campaign flags, automotive engineer Juan Pablo
  Rodríguez, 28, attended Doria Medina’s final rally in La Paz on Tuesday with
  his wife, Michelle López, also 28, and their one-year-old daughter. “Samuel
  can fix the crisis because he’s a great businessman,” he said. One of
  Bolivia’s wealthiest men, with a fortune in cement, hospitality and fast food,
  Doria Medina told the Guardian that if elected, he plans to restore the Plaza
  Murillo clock to its original, clockwise direction: “Rationality will return,
  at last.” The current clock, he said, symbolised a country “moving backwards”.
  The clock – with the number 12 still at the top, but with hands turning to the
  left to count the hours – was installed in 2014 on the initiative of David
  Choquehuanca, then foreign minister under Morales and now vice-president under
  Arce. He claimed it was a way to affirm Bolivia’s identity as a “southern
  nation”, arguing that a southern hemisphere sundial shadow moves left. But
  physicist Francesco Zaratti, an emeritus professor at the Universidad Mayor de
  San Andrés, has long argued the clock “makes no scientific sense”, noting that
  in Bolivia the shadow can sometimes move right. “When we have a new president,
  I bet it’ll be one of the first things to go, as a symbolic end to Mas’s
  20-year cycle in power,” said Zaratti. Grover Quispe Lima, 35, looks at the
  clock every day as he sells maize to feed the hundreds of pigeons in Plaza
  Murillo. He has been walloped by the crisis, with maize prices rising from 120
  (£13) to 200 (£21) bolivianos in a year. “To me, it’s irrelevant whether the
  clock moves backwards or forwards – the only thing that matters is that the
  next president improves our country,” he said.
