  Toby Wood suggests that Jeremy Corbyn’s new party should be called the
  Allotment party (Letters, 8 August). More appropriate would be the Diggers,
  after the radical and egalitarian group that emerged during the English
  revolution in the 1640s. Its members were rightly identified by Tony Benn as
  “the first true socialists”. Lynn Williams Barry, Vale of Glamorgan • In view
  of the commitments that setting up a new party involves, maybe Jeremy Corbyn,
  come next February, might try the no-dig method on his allotment. It will save
  time and his back. Chris Palmer Doonfoot, Ayrshire • My apologies to Jeremy
  Corbyn (Letters, 8 August). I am with him on the folly of selling allotments.
  Let’s hope climate change does not also rob us of the joy of lifting parsnips
  from frozen ground on our allotments with a pickaxe, as I have occasionally.
  But then I am a bit long in the tooth. Dariel Francis Tunbridge Wells, Kent •
  Wondering about Jeremy Corbyn’s gardening practices, I recall the plight of
  Lonnie Donegan. His follow-up to the magnificent Rock Island Line was Diggin’
  My Potatoes, which was banned by the BBC for being too suggestive. I hope
  there’s no one trampling on Jeremy’s vines. Ed Marshall Scrooby,
  Nottinghamshire • Stephen Pound, ex-MP and chair of Framfield Allotment
  Association, plants his spuds on Good Friday (Letters, 8 August). That,
  however, is a movable feast; in Ireland we plant them on St Patrick’s Day, and
  harvest them on the Twelfth of July. Sharman Finlay Portrush, County Antrim •
