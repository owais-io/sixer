  He was an unbeaten professional boxer for three years until financial and
  mental health struggles forced him to retire, but Billy Long Sr went on to
  punch well above his weight in saving disadvantaged youths with mentoring that
  has now inspired a successful British film-maker. When his son, Billy Long Jr,
  was facing the challenges of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
  (ADHD) and bullies linked to local gangs, Long feared the worst. He decided to
  protect him by home schooling him and created a boxing gym in a garden-shed on
  a council estate in Chelmsford, Essex. It was barely bigger than a portable
  building but, in that space, he coached him. After three years of training, he
  watched him become the junior national boxing champion, before being picked to
  represent England, and guided him with the England coaches to win the European
  Junior Boxing Championships in Bosnia in 2024. Not only did Long Jr win gold,
  but he made history by never losing a single round, which is considered
  extraordinary. Perhaps his greatest fight was showing that autism can be a
  “superpower” rather than something “negative”, his father says. Long Sr’s
  coaching began attracting local youths, inspiring them to stay away from
  juvenile delinquency, drugs and knife crime. He opened Longs ABC, a club with
  three rings on a small industrial estate, and created a boxing powerhouse that
  has produced four national champions, including two female ones. Now Long Sr
  and 15-year-old Long Jr are working with Nick Moorcroft, whose films include
  Urban Hymn, an acclaimed coming-of-age story about a young offender, played by
  Letitia Wright in her break-out role. The idea of seeing themselves on screen
  seems “surreal”, Long Sr says. But Moorcroft was inspired by their “powerful
  and uplifting, triumph-over-adversity story”, describing Long Jr as “one of
  the most gifted athletes in the world, whose autism actually helps him with a
  hyper-focus”. Ironically, Long Sr says that, initially, his son had not seemed
  “naturally talented” as a boxer. He and his wife, Samantha, ignored those who
  cast doubt on whether he had the mental and physical strength to compete. But
  he soon knew his son would become a champion, he says: “I saw something in him
  and, over time, the hurdles that we’ve crossed are nothing short of a miracle
  … When most kids would quit, he would go one more round.” Long Jr feels that
  boxing has saved him from going off the rails “100%”. “When I’m outside the
  ring, I have my struggles,” he says. “But when I’m inside the ring, I feel in
  control.” Long Sr, now 36, understands the challenges faced by disadvantaged
  youths today. His own teachers never gave him a chance, dismissing him as
  “stupid”. He got in with the wrong crowd, experiencing street fights with
  knives and trouble with the police, until his own father got him into boxing,
  giving him “self-worth” and leading to a professional career. But he abandoned
  his boxing dreams in 2016 for the sake of his son: “My son has never been in
  trouble with the police. But at school he had severe learning difficulties and
  no one looked at him as I look at Billy. Now he’s got respect in the right
  way.” Long also coached his two other sons: Mason plays for the youth team at
  Tottenham Hotspur and is a two-time boxing national champion, and Harry is
  emerging as a talented coach in his own right. The film, titled Long Shot and
  shooting next year, is as much about boxing as overcoming adversity. The cast
  will include kids from boxing clubs across the nation. Long Sr and Jr will
  have cameo roles. Moorcroft also co-wrote and produced Fisherman’s Friends and
  Finding Your Feet, two of the most successful British independent films of the
  past decade, but Long Shot is a particularly personal film. When his parents’
  marriage fell apart, Moorcroft was a troubled youth in that same area of
  Chelmsford, being expelled from school, diagnosed with ADHD, becoming a young
  offender and repeatedly being arrested as part of a street gang – until, aged
  19, a chance encounter with a Hollywood screenwriter changed his life and led
  to a career in film and television. He hopes that a film about amateur boxing
  will highlight the desperate need for government support. It was the ITV drama
  on the Post Office scandal, Mr Bates vs the Post Office, that had a real
  impact, despite an inquiry and years of campaigning for compensation payments.
  “Gyms like Longs ABC provide havens in tough communities, offering discipline,
  mentorship and purpose through structured training,” Moorcroft says. “They
  channel aggression into positive outlets, build self-esteem, and foster
  community ties, significantly reducing youth delinquency and knife crime.
  Without financial support, many such gyms struggle to operate.” He adds:
  “Knife crime and drug use are out of control. This sports transforms lives.”
  Long Sr says: “In my gym, I’ve got Muslims, Christians, people from the
  Traveller community, Chinese, black, white – and we’re all friends. We’re all
  one community. That doesn’t happen anywhere, not in schools. There’s no divide
  in boxing – and we really want to show that in the movie.” He adds: “When
  people join boxing gyms, they become part of something – and that’s a family.
  Boxing saves so many lives.” Moorcroft is writing the script for Long Shot,
  having just finished directing his next film, Mother’s Pride – a comedy drama
  about the Great British Beer awards and the plight of British pubs – that will
  be released next spring.
