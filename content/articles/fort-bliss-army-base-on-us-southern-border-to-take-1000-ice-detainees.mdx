  Fort Bliss is preparing to accept 1,000 immigrant detainees as the Trump
  administration moves to use military bases for its unprecedented mass
  deportation operation and immigration crackdown. The facility, named Camp East
  Montana, is set to begin operations on 17 August at the US army post near El
  Paso, Texas. Ice (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) said in a statement
  that the facility will initially house up to 1,000 detainees, with plans to
  expand to a capacity of 5,000 beds. If the center reaches full capacity, the
  El Paso Times reports that it would become the largest immigration detention
  facility in the US. An Ice spokesperson said the agency is using the facility
  to help “decompress Ice detention facilities in other regions” and will serve
  as a short-term processing center. The statement adds that deportations
  carried out via “Ice air operations” will also take place at the facility.
  According to Ice, the facility will house undocumented immigrants who “are in
  removal proceedings or who have final orders of removal”. The site is being
  constructed under a Department of Defense contract, Ice said, and is funded
  “as part of the essential whole-of-government approach to protecting public
  safety and preserving national security”. In July, administration officials
  announced that Acquisition Logistics LLC, a Virginia-based contractor, was
  awarded a $231.8m firm-fixed-price contract to “establish and operate” the
  “5,000 capacity, single adult, short-term detention facility”. Bloomberg
  reported that Acquisition Logistics has no prior experience operating
  detention facilities. In the statement from Ice, the agency said that Ice
  personnel “will be responsible for the management and operational authority”
  at the facility, and that the establishment of the center is being “carried
  out with contracted support and according to Ice detention standards”. The
  agency described the facility as “soft-sided” and said that it will offer
  “everything a traditional Ice detention facility offers”, which Ice said
  includes access to legal representation, a law library and space for
  visitation, recreation and medical treatment, as well as “necessary
  accommodations for disabilities, diet and religious belief”. In a statement to
  the Guardian, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson Tricia
  McLaughlin also confirmed the use of Fort Bliss to house immigration
  detainees. “Ice is indeed pursuing all available options to expand bedspace
  capacity” McLaughlin said. “This process does include housing detainees at
  certain military bases, including Fort Bliss.” In March, the Guardian reported
  that Fort Bliss has been used under multiple administrations for
  immigration-related operations. Under this Trump administration, the base has
  reportedly already been used to fly deportees on military aircraft to
  Guantánamo Bay and Central and South America. Under Joe Biden, it was used as
  an emergency shelter to for thousands of unaccompanied migrant children. In
  2021, Fort Bliss also reportedly played a key role in resettling Afghan
  refugees brought to the US after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. And in
  2016, under the Obama administration, Fort Bliss housed several hundred
  unaccompanied migrant children. The new facility being established at Fort
  Bliss comes as the Trump administration has sought to use several US military
  bases around the country as immigration detention facilities. The expansion
  has faced some criticism from Democrats. Texas representative Veronica
  Escobar, whose district includes Fort Bliss, warned that using military
  facilities as immigration detention centers could hurt the effectiveness of US
  military forces. “It’s not good for our readiness, and it degrades our
  military,” she said. Last month, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth,
  announced that both the Camp Atterbury base in Indiana and the Joint Base
  McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey could now house detained immigrants.
  Democrats from both states condemned the move, with New Jersey’s Democratic
  delegation warning that “using our country’s military to detain and hold
  undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way
  for Ice immigration raids in every New Jersey community”. The planned opening
  of the new immigration detention facility near El Paso also comes as a new
  report released this week by the office of the US senator Jon Ossoff, a
  Democrat representing Georgia, found and documented hundreds of alleged human
  rights abuses at immigration detention centers in the US since 20 January
  2025. The report cites deaths in custody, physical and sexual abuse of
  detainees, mistreatment of pregnant women and children, overcrowding and
  unsanitary living conditions, exposure to extreme temperatures, denial of
  access to attorneys, child separation, and more. In a statement about the
  report’s allegations, a spokesperson for the DHS told NBC News that “any claim
  that there are subprime conditions at Ice detention centers are false”.
