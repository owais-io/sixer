  As he touted his bona fides as the so-called “peacemaker-in-chief” during
  talks over Ukraine at the White House on Tuesday, Donald Trump made two big
  claims: that he wants peace deals instead of ceasefires, and that he has ended
  six wars since he became president. But in his haste to hammer out a peace
  deal in Ukraine, Trump is playing fast and loose with the truth. Trump and his
  administration have claimed to have helped settle the conflicts between Israel
  and Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Cambodia and Thailand,
  India and Pakistan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Egypt and Ethiopia. Yet the claim
  to have settled those conflicts is embellished and in some cases contradicted
  by continued violence in countries like DR Congo, where Rwanda-backed rebels
  missed a deadline to reach a peace deal in Doha on Tuesday. In Iran, the US
  carried out its own strikes using bunker-buster bombs against military and
  nuclear facilities before strong-arming Iran to accept a ceasefire. India has
  denied that Trump played any role in reaching a ceasefire deal with Pakistan
  to end days of strikes over the disputed Kashmir territory in May. Egypt and
  Ethiopia have no deal to settle the root of their conflict – a Nile River dam
  constructed by Ethiopia that would divert water from Egypt. And Serbia has
  denied it had any plans to pursue a war with Kosovo, although Trump took
  credit for preventing one. On the subject of ceasefires, by Trump’s own
  admission, he has often been seeking them in these conflicts. Now, he has
  sought to rewrite the record, piling pressure on Ukraine. Trump’s declaration
  that he was not seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine came after meeting Vladimir
  Putin in Alaska last week where the Russian president initially demanded that
  Ukraine cede control over territory in the country’s southeast before
  negotiating a ceasefire. The question is crucial to the sequencing of an
  eventual peace in Ukraine: Putin wants to decide which territory Russia will
  retain while the fighting still rages, while Kyiv has demanded the guns fall
  silent in a ceasefire before any decisions are made over territorial claims.
  By Monday’s meetings with European leaders, Trump had said he was no longer
  pursuing a ceasefire. “If you look at the six deals that I settled this year,
  they were all at war. I didn’t do any ceasefires,” Trump stated, telling
  Zelenskyy, “I don’t think you need a ceasefire.” But his record speaks
  otherwise. On 10 May, after the outbreak of violence between India and
  Pakistan, Trump announced: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United
  States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL
  AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common
  Sense and Great Intelligence.” On 26 July, Trump said he was calling the
  leaders of Thailand and Cambodia in order to call for a ceasefire after three
  days of border fighting. “The call with Cambodia has ended, but expect to call
  back regarding War stoppage and Ceasefire based on what Thailand has to say,”
  he wrote. “I am trying to simplify a complex situation!” And on Israel and
  Iran, Trump had also written: “It has been fully agreed by and between Israel
  and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE.” MSNBC, the US
  television news station, posted a compilation of Trump calling for a ceasefire
  in Ukraine in the weeks and days before his meetings with Putin and then
  Zelenskyy. But Trump – looking for a quick win – has rewritten his record as
  he edges closer to a Putin-endorsed roadmap to ending a conflict that has
  proved much harder to solve than he had once thought.
