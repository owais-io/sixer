  One of Britain’s first all-electric towns to be built with almost no reliance
  on fossil fuels could soon help to power the grid with renewable energy. The
  council behind the development of of a new garden town in Kent has struck a
  deal with a leading energy infrastructure company to design and operate a
  “smart” energy grid, which could mean its 8,500 households act as a virtual
  power plant for the rest of the country. Those moving into the Otterpool Park
  development, the construction of which is proposed to begin in 2027, will live
  in homes equipped with electric hobs, heating systems and electric vehicle
  chargers – as well as proposed rooftop solar panels and batteries to power
  their fossil-fuel-free households. In addition, Otterpool Park LLP, which is
  ultimately owned by the Folkestone and Hythe district council, hopes to build
  a solar farm on the council-owned land adjacent to the town, which would
  generate enough electricity to meet half the town’s electricity needs. In
  total, the town will have about 34 megawatts of renewable energy capacity, and
  one communal grid-scale battery for every 300 homes, meaning its residents
  will be able to make “significant savings on their energy bills from day one”,
  according to SNRG, the infrastructure company behind the plans. The town’s
  on-site electricity sources will also mean that its developers can avoid
  paying for significant grid reinforcements to connect the National Grid, which
  is a big source of delay for around a third of housing developments, according
  to the property company Knight Frank. The all-electric town will still draw
  from Britain’s power grid to meet its electricity needs – particularly during
  the gloomier winter months – but when parts of the National Grid need extra
  electricity, Otterpool Park will help to keep the lights on. Dan Nicholls, the
  chief product officer at SNRG, said the micro-grid would coordinate all the
  electricity devices and generation sources to use as much local solar power as
  possible while minimising the cost of importing electricity from the National
  Grid. The cumulative impact of pausing the town’s car chargers for a matter of
  seconds could save enough electricity to help the National System Operator
  manage a shortfall of power in another part of the National Grid, according to
  Nicholls. “No one single [electric vehicle] charger could create this impact –
  but reducing the charge for a few seconds on every charger could create an
  aggregated benefit. A small contribution from each charger creates a big
  saving for the grid,” he said. SNRG is pursuing other similar projects across
  the country, but Otterpool is the most advanced, Nicholls added. Jim Martin,
  the leader of Folkestone and Hythe district council, described the plans as “a
  perfect example of what can be delivered using renewable energy and reducing
  carbon emissions”. He added: “While the solar park is subject to a planning
  application, which will of course enable the public to give their views and
  allow further scrutiny by councillors, the prospect of generating green power
  on land already owned by the council and at no cost to local taxpayers is very
  attractive.” • This article was amended on 21 August 2025 to clarify that
  Otterpool Park LLP is owned by the Folkestone and Hythe district council; and
  that 2027 is the year construction is proposed to begin, not when people are
  likely to begin moving into new homes.
