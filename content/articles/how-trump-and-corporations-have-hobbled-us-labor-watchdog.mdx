  Jennifer Abruzzo, general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board
  (NLRB) under the Biden administration, was one of the first officials to be
  fired by Donald Trump once he took office in January. She wasn’t the last.
  Since then, Trump has fired a slew of government officials, including the
  National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) chair, Gwynne Wilcox, the Bureau of
  Labor Statistics commissioner, Erika McEntarfer, and most recently, he has
  attempted to fire the Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook. Abruzzo served at
  the agency for nearly 30 years before Trump fired her in January 2025, a move
  recommended in Project 2025. Now she is warning that the attacks on the US’s
  top labor watchdog threaten to return workers’ rights to levels unseen since
  1935 and empower corporations to run roughshod over the agency. “My fear is
  that if this continues, where corporations and corporate billionaire donors
  have an outsized voice and directly influence our democracy, we’re going to
  find ourselves living in an environment such as what we lived in before 1935
  when the National Labor Relations Act was enacted,” said Abruzzo. “Working
  families will be dealing with lower wages, substandard working conditions, and
  no real channels for them to fight back.” In May, the supreme court declined
  to reinstate Wilcox while she challenges Trump’s decision to terminate her
  without cause. A lower court will now have to rule on the issue, with the
  supreme court likely to follow on appeal. In the meantime, the agency’s powers
  have been effectively blocked and, Abruzzo worries, worse may be to come. The
  move was seen by opponents as a challenge to a landmark 1935 case, Humphrey’s
  Executor v United States, that ruled Congress can limit the president’s power
  to remove officials from independent administrative agencies. Abruzzo worries
  that Wilcox’s firing could pave the way for the National Labor Relations Act,
  enacted in 1935 to federally protect workers’ rights to organize and engage in
  collective bargaining, to be repealed entirely. “If the supreme court majority
  eliminates or limits the reach of Humphrey’s Executor and allows the president
  to fire decision-making officials in the executive branch, including at the
  NLRB, at his whim, then I anticipate the next step will be figuring out
  whether or not, if they are found unconstitutional, those provisions should be
  severed, or the whole [NLRA] act could conceivably be repealed,” Abruzzo said.
  In the meantime, Abruzzo argues, the NLRB has been rendered toothless. “It’s
  going to take years to sort out, the agency’s going to be completely
  ineffective in enforcing the statute, and working families are going to
  continue to suffer and not be able to get any redress for the violations of
  their rights. It’s why I think states need to step in and protect their
  citizenry.” Major corporations are already making ground against the agency
  after the ruling. On 19 August, the US court of appeals fifth circuit ruled
  preliminary injunctions halting unfair labor practice cases against Elon
  Musk’s SpaceX and two other employers can remain in place as the employers’
  challenge the constitutionality of the NLRB. The NLRB declined to comment.
  SpaceX did not respond to multiple requests for comment. “I think we’re going
  to see a flood of employers forum shopping and flocking into district courts
  in the fifth circuit area seeking to get preliminary injunctions preventing
  the NLRB cases that frankly are seeking to hold corporations accountable for
  their law breaking from moving forward, and that’s going to put an end to the
  NLRB being able to enforce the act in any meaningful way,” said Abruzzo. “This
  is all about elevating corporate interests above workers’ rights.” The firings
  have also left the NLRB without a quorum throughout most of the Trump
  administration, rendering it unable to issue decisions on cases. In January
  2025, after Trump fired Wilcox, the first Black woman to serve as chair of the
  NLRB board. Trump nominated two members to the board. They are awaiting a vote
  in the Senate for confirmation, while the term of one of two remaining board
  members, Marvin Kaplan, expired on 27 August. The agency has also proposed a
  4.7% budget cut of $14m for fiscal year 2026, after noting the agency expects
  to lose nearly 10% of its staff to voluntary resignation and early
  retirements. The acting general counsel of the NLRB argued earlier this month
  that the board “has largely been unaffected” by the lack of quorum. But since
  Trump took office, the NLRB has only issued six decisions compared with fiscal
  year 2024, when the board issued 259 decisions. “Unless an employer is willing
  to go along with what the board says, the employer can stall a case
  indefinitely right now,” said Lauren McFerran, who served as chair of the NLRB
  during the Biden administration and as a board member from December 2014 to
  December 2019 and again in July 2020 to January 2021. “So whether it’s a
  [union] election case, whether it’s an unfair labor practice case, the minute
  the employer says that they’re not willing to go along and that they want to
  raise an objection to the board, you’re stuck for the foreseeable future at
  this point,” added McFerran. Abruzzo argues the firing of Wilcox by Trump, if
  allowed to stand by the courts, would eliminate the independence of the NLRB
  in favor of corporations. It’s up to the public to push back on these trends
  of stripping away protections for workers at the behest of wealthy, powerful
  corporations and billionaires like Musk, she said. “There is strength in
  numbers, and we all need to remember we matter. We make an impact on each
  other’s lives each and every day, and we can’t let the voice of corporate
  billionaires drown out our voices or squelch our actions and our spirit,” said
  Abruzzo. “We’re not powerless, and we have the power to demand changes to the
  way we’re governed, to the way we live our lives. That includes taking to the
  streets, frankly, and protesting over inadequate wages and working conditions
  and over economic, social and racial injustice. We need to do more in
  amplifying our voices, to make sure we’re heard and that actions are taken
  that are going to benefit us, because that’s, in my opinion, how the tactic of
  divide and conquer is going to be vanquished.”
