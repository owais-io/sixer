  Adults interested in nostalgic toys such as Pokémon trading cards are behind a
  rise in UK toy sales, data shows. “Kidults,” or buyers aged 12 and over, are
  often linked to the fortunes of the UK toy industry, however it’s over-18s who
  appear to have driven the increase in sales in the first half of 2025. Market
  research company Circana said games and puzzles, including Pokémon cards, are
  enjoying a fresh wave of popularity among nostalgic adults, helped by social
  media influencers brandishing their rare finds. We’d like to hear from adults
  in the UK about their nostalgic toy purchases. What have you bought and why do
  you think they are so popular among adults? How much, on average, do you spend
  a month, and what is your most expensive purchase? If you’re having trouble
