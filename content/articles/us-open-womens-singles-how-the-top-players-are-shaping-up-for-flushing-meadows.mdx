  How the top five shape up Aryna Sabalenka Is 2025 just not the world No 1’s
  year? Finishing as runner-up in Melbourne and Paris and falling in the
  semi-finals at Wimbledon, Sabalenka has failed to get over the line at slams
  this season despite being a constant favourite. But with her powerful game and
  a devastating serve – especially on hard courts – she has the tools to make a
  deep run as the defending champion in New York. The Belarusian has racked up a
  total of 52 weeks as the world No 1, surpassing her compatriot Victoria
  Azarenka’s 51 for the 13th-most weeks atop the WTA rankings since they began
  in 1975. Perhaps, like Roger Federer in 2008, the 27-year-old can triumph in
  the final slam of the year after making two finals and a semi. Coco Gauff The
  love the 2023 winner receives at Flushing Meadows is palpable and it seems to
  elevate her game. Gauff stunned with a French Open win this summer, but the
  American’s grass season was a struggle, culminating in a first-round exit at
  Wimbledon. The 21-year-old’s weak serve, in particular, has been a point of
  discussion. “I am disappointed in myself when it comes to that part of my
  game,” she has said. “Serving well in practice, I would like to transfer it to
  the matches. I am winning, having one part of my game on a crutch. So if I can
  stand on both feet, then I can only imagine it is going to be a lot more
  straightforward.” Her 23 double faults in a win against Danielle Collins in
  Montreal were the most in a WTA level match since 2011. Iga Swiatek After a
  stunning Wimbledon victory that included a historic double bagel in the final,
  the Pole enters the US Open as a favourite after a difficult start to the
  year. The 2022 champion appears to be back to her most dominant form and with
  a formidable head-to-head record against most of the field, the 24-year-old
  may have a significant mental edge over other contenders. Since the start of
  the 2020 season, she has claimed the most wins at the WTA level over grand
  slam champions with 44. Jessica Pegula This year the American has won three
  singles titles, in Bad Homburg, Charleston and Austin, and reached finals in
  Miami and Adelaide, but has failed to go further than the fourth round in a
  slam. She is coming off a third-round upset to Magda Linette in Cincinnati,
  where her slow movement hindered her game. At 31, her chance to win a grand
  slam is getting slimmer, but she has a strong record on hard courts and in New
  York, finishing as runner-up last year. Mirra Andreeva Though she has yet to
  win a grand slam, the 18-year-old is quickly becoming a serious contender. She
  has an aggressive baseline game, but her ability to keep focus when things
  fail to go her way needs improving. The Russian’s 36-12 record in 2025 gives
  her two more wins than her previous best of 34 last year, and her run to the
  Wimbledon quarter-finals made her the youngest player to reach the top five
  since Maria Sharapova. Other home hopes Madison Keys It is a good time for
  American tennis. Outside Gauff and Pegula, Keys will be another name that is
  expected to impress in New York. Her breakthrough grand slam win came this
  year in Australia, where she defeated Sabalenka in the final and, though she
  has not maintained that form, she remains a dangerous opponent. Emma Navarro,
  ranked No 11, will also hope to better her semi-final appearance last year.
  Best British hopes Emma Raducanu The British No 1 is playing with a newfound
  freedom, saying she has never felt more confident heading to Flushing Meadows
  since she won the tournament. Since winning 10 matches to win the 2021 edition
  as a qualifier, Raducanu has not had a single victory in New York, suffering
  first-round losses in 2022 and 2024 and missing the 2023 tournament due to
  surgery. This will be her first grand slam with her new coach, Francisco Roig,
  who was part of Rafael Nadal’s team from 2005 until 2022. It will also be
  interesting to watch Sonay Kartal in her main draw debut in New York. The
  Brighton native had an exciting Wimbledon run but lost in the first round in
  Cincinnati and lacks hard-court experience. Big name most likely to crash out
  early Venus Williams A legend of the sport and a former world No 1, Williams
  has received a wildcard into the main draw, an obvious decision given the
  much-beloved former champion will draw massive crowds. However, she has only
  three wins from 14 since January 2023 and last won a US Open match in 2019.
  While her love for the game is undeniable, an early exit seems probable. One
  to watch Victoria Mboko The 18-year-old arrives brimming with confidence after
  winning her maiden WTA title at her home Canadian Open, defeating four grand
  slam champions along the way. Mboko started the season ranked outside the top
  300. Seven months later she is the world No 24 and for the first time anywhere
  will be seeded. “The US Open, it’s been one of my favourite tournaments ever
  since I was really little. It is very special for me.” Mboko said. “I don’t
  really have many expectations for myself. I just want to have as much fun as
  possible.”
