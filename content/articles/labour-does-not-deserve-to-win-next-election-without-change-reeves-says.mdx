  Labour does not “deserve” to win the next election if it does not change the
  country, Rachel Reeves has said, as she acknowledged some voters were
  disappointed with the party’s record since entering government. The chancellor
  said she understood the unhappiness felt by some voters towards a government
  that has U-turned on winter fuel allowance and welfare policies in recent
  months. Reeves claims she has had to grapple with financial challenges
  inherited from the Conservatives, while increasing spending to repair public
  services. Speaking to broadcaster Iain Dale at the Edinburgh festival fringe,
  she said: “The reason people voted Labour at the last election is they want to
  change and they were unhappy with the way that the country was being governed.
  “They know that we inherited a mess. They know it’s not easy to put it right,
  but people are impatient for change. “I’m impatient for change as well, but
  I’ve also got the job of making sure the sums always add up – and it doesn’t
  always make you popular because you can’t do anything you might want to do.
  You certainly can’t do everything straight away, all at once.” She told the
  audience at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre that Labour needed
  to enact the change that voters wanted. She added otherwise the party did not
  “deserve” to win the next general election in 2029. Reeves said the government
  had the balance “about right” on taxes, in a week where she faced renewed
  calls from Labour politicians for a wealth tax. Former Foreign Office minister
  Anneliese Dodds, who briefly held the shadow chancellor position for Labour in
  opposition, said ministers should consider evidence set out by the Wealth Tax
  Commission, which she said had “changed the debate” on the policy. Reeves
  said: “Of course you’re going to disappoint people. No one wants to pay more
  taxes. Everyone wants more money than public spending – and borrowing is not a
  free option, because you’ve got to pay for it. “I think people know those sort
  of constraints but no one really likes them and I’m the one that has to sort
  the sums up.” The party faces difficulties ahead of the Scottish parliament
  elections in Holyrood next year. It has slipped backwards into third place,
  according to opinion polling, a year after it was neck and neck with the SNP.
  Polling in June showed it on 19%, behind the SNP in 29% and Reform UK on 22%.
  This is in contrast to a survey carried out a month after Labour’s general
  election win last year, which showed the party just ahead of the ruling SNP,
  with Reform languishing far behind. There have been some signs of promise,
  however, as Labour won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse byelection for
  the Scottish parliament in June. The closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery
  before its transition to an import-only terminal caused unpopularity for
  Labour. About 400 jobs were lost as a result of it shutting in April. The MP
  who had championed it being kept open, Brian Leishman, has since been
  suspended by Labour for rebelling over welfare reform. Meanwhile, the Labour
  government in Westminster’s ban on new drilling in the North Sea has been
  accused of causing “strangulation” of the economy in north-east Scotland.
  However, Reeves told the audience in the Scottish capital that the government
  was further investing in Scotland. She said the £200m investment in carbon
  capture technology in Aberdeenshire had been welcomed by the industry. She
  said she also understood Labour’s windfall tax on oil and gas were not
  welcomed by the sector. “I can understand that that’s extra tax that the oil
  and gas sector are paying but you can’t really have one without the other,”
  she said. Reeves also commented unfavourably about Jeremy Corbyn after being
  asked about him by Dale, predicting the public will reject his new party and
  have the same reaction to him as it did twice before. Corbyn launched the
  political party with former Labour MP Zarah Sultana. It still does not appear
  to have a name but has been marketed as “Your Party”. The former Labour party
  leader has vowed it will “take on the rich and powerful”. Asked about whether
  the new party could eat into Labour’s support by becoming a “Reform of the
  left”, the chancellor said: “Jeremy Corbyn has had two chances to be prime
  minister and I think the country gave their verdict, most recently in 2019
  when Labour had its worst result since 1935. “If he wants to give it another
  go, be my guest. I think the voters will have the same reaction.” Asked by
  Dale if Labour was being complacent about the new political group, she said:
  “It’s not being complacent. He tried to destroy my party and he can now go set
  up his own party. “The country has rejected him twice. The bloke’s got a big
  ego. He can have another go but I think the country will have the same
  verdict.” Her comments prompted some of the biggest cheers of her chat with
  Dale. Corbyn has said that more than 500,000 people had signed up to the
  movement in less than a week. The figure was dismissed by Reeves, who told the
  crowd in Edinburgh that Labour minister Jess Phillips had received an email
  stating she had signed up to the party. PA Media contributed reporting • This
  article was amended on 4 August 2025. The person Rachel Reeves said had
  received an email stating she had signed up to Jeremy Corbyn’s new party was
  Jess Phillips, not Ellie Reeves.
