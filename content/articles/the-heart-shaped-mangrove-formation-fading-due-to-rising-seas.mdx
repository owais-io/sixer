  On the west coast of New Caledonia, Isobelle Goa searches the thick, tangled
  mangrove roots for mudcrabs. Goa lives on the outskirts of the archipelago’s
  most famous mangrove formation: a light-green, heart-shaped patch of forest
  known as the Heart of Voh. “It is grandiose. It’s what God has put on the land
  for us,” Goa says. “It has a presence about it. My heart carries this heart
  with it. It is important to protect it and be kind to the mangroves inside.”
  Its iconic outline brought the Heart of Voh international recognition and is
  plastered across billboards on New Caledonia, a symbol of the Pacific
  territory’s pristine natural environment. But the heart is now under assault
  from the climate crisis, as rising seas change the salinity of the water and
  alter the kind of vegetation that can survive there. Its distinctive shape and
  the ecosystem within it are also changing. In the late 1990s the pale, barren
  surface of the heart contrasted sharply with the green mangrove forest around
  it, creating its iconic silhouette when viewed from above. Sitting slightly
  above the surrounding mudflats, the heart’s soil was dry and salty – too
  extreme for vegetation to grow. “It was just a yellowish salt flat,” says Dr
  Cyril Marchand, a mangrove expert at the University of New Caledonia. “No
  mangroves could survive there.” Over the past 20 years, the conditions in the
  water began to change. A species of salt-tolerant mangrove called Avicennia
  started to grow there and has now fully colonised the heart. The change is
  linked to rising sea levels: data shows waters along New Caledonia’s west
  coast have risen about 2mm a year for several decades. As tidal waters flow
  into the heart more frequently, the salty soil becomes diluted – the ideal
  conditions for Avicennia to grow. As the species spreads, the heart’s
  distinctive shape is changing. Marchand says if sea levels continue to rise,
  the salinity will reduce further. That will again change the conditions to
  allow another species of mangrove – Rhizophora – to spread across the heart.
  “It’s possible that in 30, 40 or 50 years, only Rhizophora will grow there,”
  Marchand says. “The heart may vanish entirely.” While increased mangrove cover
  seems positive, sea level rise is also inundating and removing mangrove
  habitat closer to sea. The changing ecosystem means sea levels and mangroves
  are pushing closer to coastal communities, reducing land availability and
  marine habitats. Tracking changes in the heart Mangroves have always shifted
  and changed over time, but Marchand says it is now happening at an
  unprecedented speed. By drilling deep into the mud and assessing sediment
  patterns, Marchand and his team were able to determine how mangroves have
  moved over time. “In the past, it would take 500 years [for mangroves to
  migrate this far], now it’s happening in decades, driven by climate change,”
  he says. Changes to mangroves – and the ecosystems they support – are
  significant for coastal communities relying on them for livelihoods. Globally,
  it is estimated that more than half of mangrove systems are at risk of
  collapse by 2050, and between 1994 and 2020 coverage of mangroves decreased by
  3.4% around the world. “It’s important for the whole world to protect
  mangroves because our biodiversity is just so unique,” Marchand says. “For the
  local people, the fishermen, the Kanak, mangroves are important. The Heart of
  Voh is symbolic of that.” In recent years, satellite technology has been used
  to track real-time changes in the Heart of Voh and surrounding mangroves. “We
  can go up to 15 centimetres of resolution using satellite imagery and collect
  data during the night and bad weather like cyclones,” says Rémi Andreoli,
  deputy director at Bluecham, a company specialising in satellite imagery and
  data collection. “It’s a lot easier to observe from space than walking through
  mud up to your knees.” Andreoli has been tracking the Heart of Voh mangrove
  system for the past 12 years. The satellite data can detect biochemical
  changes otherwise invisible to the eye. The information is used by researchers
  monitoring changes to the Heart of Voh, as well as to assess the impact of
  mining activities on the environment. “It’s really powerful to monitor
  variation between species and changes in tree cover and to see how mangroves
  are evolving over time in the face of climate change,” Andreoli says. “We use
  this information to help businesses, decision makers and scientists to assess
  mangroves status and protect their environment.” ‘We can’t let it slip away’
  Protecting the heart is a priority for the local community and tourism
  operators. For over 15 years Günter Gerant, a pilot at tourism flight company
  Haut Vol, has shown tourists the Heart of Voh by air. He says it is one of the
  most famous things to see in New Caledonia. “We [Haut Vol] started the
  discovery flights because everyone wanted to see the Heart,” Gerant says. The
  veteran pilot plays an important role in the local economy. “People come to
  see the Heart, our mangroves and our coral reefs so it’s really important to
  maintain these ecosystems for our livelihoods,” he says. Back in Voh, locals
  stress the importance of protecting their mangroves. Goa and a team of women
  from the nearby village plant mangrove propagules in a nearby nursery. She
  knows the mangroves are critical to her community’s survival. “It’s an
  ecosystem that protects us from erosion and big waves. It protects us and the
  country,” she says. “Generation after generation teaches our children to hunt
  in the mangroves. We can’t let it slip away.” Goa adds: “We have to protect it
  for the future of our culture.”
