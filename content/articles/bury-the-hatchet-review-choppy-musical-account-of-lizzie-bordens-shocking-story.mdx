  story

  How do you stage the life and trial of Lizzie Borden, accused and acquitted of
  killing her father and stepmother with an axe in Fall River, Massachusetts, in
  1892? Actor-musicians interweaving folk songs, murder ballads, blues and
  bluegrass is one idea. Framing the story as a sort of true crime podcast is
  another. So is making it a macabre comedy. How about the cast stepping in and
  out of performance as if in rehearsal? What about getting the audience
  involved? Out of the Forest Theatre’s production adopts all these approaches,
  muddying the water for an already complicated story. Writer Sasha Wilson stars
  alongside Lawrence Boothman and David Leopold in Vicky Moran’s production,
  which rattles along at such a pace that even if you know the bare bones of the
  case it can be hard to keep up. The cast spend little time in character as the
  principal figures of Borden, her sister, the family’s maid and the couple,
  Abby and Andrew, respectively given 40 and 41 whacks of the axe according to
  the grisly rhyme. The result is curiously emotionless, the script overloaded
  with footnotes to a story that feels stifled. Evidently well researched, there
  is some captivating detail – not least about “America’s most haunted house”,
  where the killings took place, now operating as a hotel – but a leaner account
  would be far more haunting. The show never chills and has a jarring
  combination of occasional earnestness and throwaway comedy (complete with
  talking corpse) akin to the Borden rock opera Lizzie. It does, however, raise
  evergreen questions about sensationalism and sexism, and captures the
  historical era, including the limited scientific knowledge hindering the
  investigation. In one of several inspired touches, a violin is delivered in
  lieu of a baby for a birthing scene. While the story is frustratingly
  stop-start, the music is richly delivered, from the opener Feeling Good to The
  Wayfaring Stranger, Down in the Willow Garden and Little Sadie, its lyrics now
  name-checking Borden who will be for ever cast as both killer and victim. • At
  Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival
