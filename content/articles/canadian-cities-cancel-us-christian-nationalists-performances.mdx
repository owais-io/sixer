  Eight Canadian cities have revoked performance permits for Sean Feucht, a
  Trump-supporting Christian nationalist preacher and musician, who led anti-gay
  demonstrations outside Disneyland and protested against mask mandates during
  the Covid-19 pandemic. Over the past two weeks, performances by Feucht, have
  been cancelled in Halifax, Nova Scotia; Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island;
  Moncton, New Brunswick; Quebec City, Quebec; Vaughan, Ontario; and Abbotsford,
  British Columbia. Local authorities cited safety concerns or code of conduct
  violations as reasons for cancelling his appearances. The municipal government
  in Winnipeg, Manitoba, denied Feucht a permit to perform due to “operational
  challenges”. Feucht has publicly opposed homosexuality and complained that
  kindergarten students were being taught “transgenderism” and made to feel “bad
  because they were born white”. Feucht has also advocated in interviews for a
  country where there is “no law outside of the biblical moral law”. His attempt
  to tour Canada has prompted a fierce debate over whether local authorities in
  the country should allow far-right figures to perform – and warnings that
  efforts to ban such speech could instead enhance his profile. “[Feucht’s
  performance] is putting the public at risk, their safety at risk,” said
  Candace Banks, the vice-president of Kelowna Pride, a non-profit that supports
  the LGBTQ+ community in Kelowna, British Columbia. “He spews hate speech.
  There’s a fine line between freedom of speech and hate speech,” they said. A
  church in Montreal was fined $2,500 for allowing Feucht last month to perform
  despite city authorities’ refusal to grant a permit because of the California
  musician’s views. “Freedom of expression is one of our fundamental values, but
  hateful and discriminatory speech is not accepted in Montreal and, as in other
  Canadian cities, the show will not be tolerated,” a spokesperson for the
  Montreal mayor’s office told CBC. Municipal governments in Kelowna and
  Edmonton, Alberta, are still mulling over whether to allow Feucht to go ahead
  with his scheduled tour stops later this month, after an outcry from residents
  in many cities and LGBTQ+ rights groups. The city of Saskatoon in Saskatchewan
  confirmed on 30 July that it had approved Feucht’s permit for a show scheduled
  for 21 August. City officials told the broadcaster that there were no public
  safety concerns emerging that would require the event’s cancellation, but they
  would monitor the situation. The city’s mayor, Cynthia Block, said that she
  had received many complaints about Feucht and was in contact with local
  police. “They are doing their due diligence to make sure that they are
  following all of the correct legislation to protect freedom of speech, but
  understanding foundationally that this is a safety issue. It is a physical
  safety issue, and I am personally worried,” she told CBC. Banks said Feucht
  had “crossed the line” and should not be permitted to play in public spaces. A
  spokesperson for Feucht said he would not be able to respond to a request for
  comment, but referred to his public social media posts after his permit to
  perform in Winnipeg was revoked. “This going to backfire spectacularly,” he
  wrote. After the Walt Disney Company opposed Florida’s so-called “don’t say
  gay” bill in 2022, Feucht led protests outside the company’s California
  headquarters. James Turk, the director of the Centre for Free Expression at
  Toronto Metropolitan University, said Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms
  has clear protections for free speech and that barring Feucht could
  inadvertently amplify his message. “The attempt to censor him is actually
  giving him a platform,” said Turk.
