  Bolivia’s presidential election will go to a runoff for the first time, with
  two rightwing candidates competing for the presidency – marking the end of
  nearly 20 years of dominance by the leftist Movimiento al Socialismo (Mas).
  The candidate with the most votes, however, turned out to be a surprise:
  centre-right senator Rodrigo Paz Pereira, 57, who had started the campaign
  with just 3% support in opinion polls. In second came Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga,
  65, a rightwing former president who briefly led the country in 2001 after the
  resignation of ex-dictator Hugo Banzer. With just over 95% of ballots counted
  in the electoral court’s “preliminary” tally, Paz Pereira was on 32.1% and
  Quiroga on 26.8%. “I want to thank all the men and women who made this
  possible and gave a voice to those of us who had none, who didn’t appear in
  the polls, who didn’t exist,” said Paz Pereira, the son of former president
  Jaime Paz Zamora, who governed from 1989 to 1993. Paz Pereira, the senator for
  Tarija, gave effusive thanks to his running mate, former police captain Edman
  Lara Montaño, who became known for exposing police corruption and who,
  according to many analysts, was a decisive draw for voters. “We will fight
  corruption head on, dammit!” Paz Pereira shouted to journalists and dozens of
  supporters waiting for his speech late on Sunday in La Paz. Quiroga said: “It
  is a historic night – not for one party, not for one faction, not for one
  candidacy, but for all Bolivians who have spoken with strength, with faith,
  with hope and with dignity. Today, we have taken a giant step towards a better
  tomorrow.” The electoral court stressed that the figures are “preliminary and
  not definitive”. That is because Bolivia uses two counts: a quicker one, based
  on photos of each ballot sent to a data-processing centre, and the slower
  definitive one, where every vote is publicly counted and scrutinised at
  polling stations before entering the system. The court has up to seven days to
  release the official results. As neither secured more than 50% of the vote, or
  at least 40% with a 10-point lead over the runner-up, a second round will be
  held on 19 October. Like the first round, the run-off campaign is expected to
  be dominated by the economic crisis – the worst in four decades – with
  shortages of dollars and fuel and rising inflation. Luis Arce, the deeply
  unpopular Mas president, chose not to seek re-election and instead put forward
  his interior minister, 36-year-old Eduardo del Castillo, who won just 3.16% of
  the vote. It is a paltry share compared with the more than 50% that had
  secured first-round victories for Arce and former president Evo Morales in the
  past – but just enough for the party to avoid losing its legal status, as the
  threshold is set at 3%. Some analysts described the shift to the right as
  being part of a broader “rightward turn” across South America, after the
  victories of Javier Milei in Argentina and Daniel Noboa in Ecuador. But the
  analyst Gonzalo Chávez Alvarez said the result was a continuation of a
  well-established pattern in which Bolivian voters swung from left to right –
  and back again – approximately every 20 years. “It was the same with Morales’s
  first victory in 2005, when the right had governed for a long time and the
  population had also grown weary of the country’s political institutions,” said
  Alvarez, a professor at the Universidad Católica Boliviana. According to the
  preliminary count, 19.4% of ballots were null and void – far above the
  historic average in Bolivian elections, which has typically been below 5%.
  Bolivia’s first Indigenous leader, Morales had spent recent weeks urging his
  supporters to cast null and void votes in protest against rulings by the
  constitutional and electoral courts that blocked him from seeking a fourth
  term. Centre-right business tycoon Samuel Doria Medina, 66, who had led polls
  for much of the campaign, ended up third with 19.9% of the vote. Doria Medina
  acknowledged his defeat and announced that he would back Paz Pereira in the
  runoff. In the Bolivian press, analysts suggested one possible advantage for
  Paz Pereira was that the campaign battle in recent weeks had been concentrated
  between Quiroga, Doria Medina and the left, leaving the senator outside the
  main line of attacks – or even of fake news campaigns. Also, polls indicated
  there were still large numbers of undecided voters before election day. The
  highest-placed leftwing candidate was Senator Andrónico Rodríguez, 36, who
  left Mas to run with a small coalition. Having once polled as high as third,
  he eventually finished fourth with just over 8%. More than 2,500 national and
  international observers, from bodies including the European Union and the
  Organisation of American States, monitored the vote and were expected to
  publish their preliminary reports in the coming days. During the day, they
  said polling had proceeded normally. According to the electoral court, the
  election took place without problems, apart from some “isolated incidents”.
  One of them involved Rodríguez. As he voted in Entre Ríos, a Morales
  stronghold about 50 miles from where the former president remains entrenched,
  the 36-year-old senator was booed and pelted with stones by what he described
  as “a small group of extremists identified as supporters of Morales”.
  Rodríguez had to be escorted by a member of the armed forces to cast his vote.
  He was not injured. Once seen as Morales’s natural heir due to his Indigenous
  roots and leadership in the coca growers’ union, the senator was called a
  traitor for launching his own candidacy. Wanted on an arrest warrant since
  October for allegedly fathering a child with a 15-year-old, Morales voted in
  Villa 14 de Septiembre, about 25 miles from the tiny village where hundreds of
  coca growers have prevented police and the army from detaining the former
  president. Morales denies having committed any crime and claims the case is
  part of a plan by the current government to destroy him politically. President
  Arce, who served as Morales’s finance minister before becoming his main rival,
  cast his vote in La Paz and said he would ensure “an absolutely democratic
  transition” in November, when the next president is sworn in.
