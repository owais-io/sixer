  The report has landed and that’s my cue to get outta here. A comprehensive win
  for the Saffas who gave their compatriots back home a reason to smile after a
  pretty torrid weekend of sport. The Aussies will lick their wounds as they
  look to bounce back at the Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay on Friday. We’ll
  be back too, brining you every ball of the second ODI. 11 of the 18 wickets to
  fall went to spinners. Is this a sign that both teams struggle against the
  slower, turning ball? Is it just because of the pitch? The T20 World Cup is in
  Sri Lanka. The lessons learned in this ODI series could be pivotal. And now
  South Africa have a better record against Australia in Australia. Won 20, lost
  19, tied one. In this format, South Africa have been utterly dominant over
  Australia. That’s not only four wins in a row in ODIs but 16 wins from the
  last 20 played against the Aussies. Colum Fordham has written in: This match
  provides further confirmation that South Africa’s victory over Australia in
  the World Test Championship was no fluke. Admittedly, this is a different
  format but the Proteas are becoming a much tougher nut to crack. Superb
  bowling from Maharaj, ably supported by Ngidi and Burger. What you said,
  Colum. Oh, and a shout out to Julian Menz, a Durban-born “Pom” (his words) who
  wrote in from “sunny Sweden”, watching the game with his “Indian mates”. Hope
  you enjoyed it Julez! Finally, it’s Temba Bavuma: A good all round performance
  from the boys. We were put in to bat and did well. The wicket was a bit
  two-paced. We put on a competitive score, the bowlers did their thing. It
  wasn’t a bad toss to lose. We didn’t expect it ti turn as much. Kesh showed
  his class there. The boys made me look good with the decision [to play two
  spinners]. Now Mitch Marsh: Keshav is an outstanding bowler. You just have to
  take your hat off to him. He won them the game. It wasn’t a lack of
  confidence. We’ve played spin well as a group. He bowled well. No prizes if
  you guess that Keshav Maharaj would win the player of the match award. Here’s
  what he has to say: I made my ODI debut in 2016 in Australia so it’s a special
  to get my first five-for [here]. The wicket was a little sticky. We just tried
  to utilise that and get the reward. The boys spoke that there was turn as the
  game went on. I just tried to use the angles. We’ve always been slow starters
  in series so it’s great to put the front foot forward. Shows what I know. I
  said that South Africa were perhaps 20 or 30 short. And when the Aussies were
  cruising at 60-0 loss I was confident in my call. But thenSubrayen had Head
  stumped before Maharaj went on the tear, bagging five wickets in five overs –
  three bowled, two lbw – to leave Australia in tatters at 89-6. That’s six
  wickets for just 29 runs in the space of nine overs. Mitch Marsh was brilliant
  for his 88. But he ran out of partners and fell in the quest of big blows.
  Credit to South Africa. They weren’t perfect with either bat or ball, but that
  is a pretty comprehensive win to get the series going. Ngidi rattles the
  stumps of Zampa! Full, straight and the swishing bat can’t make contact with
  it. Australia are bowled out in the 41st over for 198. They did well to fight
  back from 89-6 after Maharaj bagged a five-for in the blink of an eye, but it
  was always going to be too much for the lower order. That’s four in a row for
  South Africa over the Aussies in ODI cricket. It shoots low and Ellis is gone!
  But was this missing leg? It looked like it to the naked eye but there are no
  reviews left. Labuschagne and Carey burned them both earlier in the piece so
  Ellis has to go. Yup, missing leg stump. 40th over: Australia 196-8 (Ellis 14,
  Zampa 10) Subrayen closes out his night with 10-0-46-1. He should have had
  another wicket and will be annoyed that his last ball is spanked for six down
  the ground by Ellis who skipped down the track and timed it perfectly. It’s
  actually quite an expensive over, going for 11. Australia won’t get points for
  this but if these last two wickets can remain intact they’ll be delighted.
  Games within a game. 39th over: Australia 185-8 (Ellis 7, Zampa 6) Zampa edges
  Ngidi for four then bags a single after getting dropped in the covers by
  Stubbs. This is meandering now. South Africa are not showing a ruthlessness
  that is needed from them. For all their great work, the Saffas have allowed
  things to drift at times. Another drop! Stubbs shells a tough chance diving in
  the covers. Hmmm, maybe not so tough actually. Zampa drives on the up. It
  wasn’t a gimme but at this level that has to be taken. 38th over: Australia
  180-8 (Ellis 7, Zampa 1) Subrayen returns. This game would have been over by
  now if Maharaj caught Dwarshuis off his bowling in the 17th over. But here we
  are. Ellis skips down the track and smears a four over cover. Two singles
  elsewhere. Can South Africa mop this up. They’ve had some issues with wagging
  tails. Time to put their foot down. 37th over: Australia 174-8 (Ellis 2, Zampa
  0) A wicket maiden from Burger. He’s done superbly after getting serious tap
  in his opening spell. He’s stuck with this short length and on a deck that’s
  slowing up a touch he’s been difficult to hit. The wicket of a set Marsh will
  do his confidence the world of good. The drinks break brings the wicket and
  that’s the game! I think it’s safe to call this one now. Burger, who has been
  brilliant in his second spell, banged it in short but crucially got it outside
  the eye line of Marsh who was always looking to heave this across the line
  towards the leg side. Marsh has to reach for it and can only feather it behind
  for a simple catch. A wonderful innings comes to an end and with it
  Australia’s best hope. We’ve had an email about the umpire’s call conundrum.
  This from Henry North: I’m interested in what you mean about the review
  against Ellis. I get the point, but isn’t that presuming the umpire gives it
  not out because of the edge? Sometimes they indicate that, but it’s not
  formalised, is it? My memory of umpire’s call when it was introduced - how old
  we are - was not only that it left agency for the umpires, but that the
  technology, though good, was imperfect. I think overturning any decision close
  enough to be umpire’s call gets uncomfortably close to removing any margin for
  error, or presuming technological perfection. I quite like a margin for error,
  if it’s not too wide of a margin. Thanks mate. I guess what I was getting at
  is that if the umpire gave it as a run off the bat then he thought the batter
  hit it. Would he have given it out if he thought the batter missed it? Does
  that make sense? I’m starting to confuse myself. 36th over: Australia 174-7
  (Marsh 88, Ellis 2) It’s getting nervy but there’s hope while Marsh is there.
  He’s been brilliant. Markram keeps him quiet with some shorter stuff but a
  spray down the leg side is easily swatted for four behind square. A single
  farms the strike off the last ball. A single earlier from Ellis – who faced
  two dots – means that’s six off the set. It’s short of the required rate of
  8.78. 35th over: Australia 168-7 (Marsh 83, Ellis 1) Burger is hammering a
  short length, encouraging Marsh to hook with fielders stationed in the deep.
  Twice he declines the single, recognising that he needs to farm the strike.
  Once he skies a pull into the gap at cow corner. He then swivels a pull for
  two wide of fine leg. A wide over the head adds one to the total before Burger
  beats him for pace with another bumper. Just five off the over and Ellis will
  be on strike for the next one. A handy return from Burger who has come back
  well after an expensive start. 34th over: Australia 163-7 (Marsh 79, Ellis 1)
  Another great over from South Africa. Just two off it, one a leg-bye after
  Ellis was very lucky to survive an lbw shout. The umpire thought he hit it.
  Markram was convinced he didn’t. Markram was correct but the umpire’s call of
  not-out saved the Aussie. The required rate is now above eight. Marsh is not
  facing enough deliveries. Ellis survives the umpire’s call! But he’s given it
  not-out because he thought Ellis hit it. But the replays show that he didn’t
  hit it. So shouldn’t it be overturned? One for another day. There’s a review
  for lbw on Ellis. They run and it’s been given as a run off the bat. But the
  Saffas review. They think they’re in business here with Markram turning one
  back into the right hander… 33rd over: Australia 161-7 (Marsh 78, Ellis 1)
  South Africa needed that wicket. In fact they’ve done well to tighten things
  up in the last three overs. Marsh now has to do it all on his own and hope
  that his bowlers can hang around with him. The required rate is now up to
  eight. Just one off tha Burger over that also brought the wicket. They break
  the partnership! Burger digs it in short again but this time takes the pace
  off. Dwarshuis rocks back into position early but has to wait for it. He can’t
  time it and drags a dolly to Brevis at midwicket. I’d say that’s justice for
  escaping a stumping shout in the previous over. South Africa now back on top
  and taking aim at the bowlers. 32nd over: Australia 160-6 (Marsh 78, Dwarshuis
  33) Markram beats Dwarshuis past the outside edge and Rickelton whips off the
  bails behind the stumps. The appea for stumped is sent upstairs and the third
  umpire makes his mind up very quickly, deciding that it was not-out. I thought
  it looked out, but what do I know? Three runs from it. Game is in the balance.
  31st over: Australia 157-6 (Marsh 77, Dwarshuis 31) Burger is persisting with
  a short length but it’s not causing much fuss down at the other end. Marsh and
  Dwarshuis swat singles down in the deep. A diving Brevis twice prevents loose
  balls from going to the boundary. Just two runs off the over but, once again,
  it feels like a moral win for the Aussies who are looking more and more
  comfortable as this partnership swells. It’s up to 68. 30th over: Australia
  155-6 (Marsh 76, Dwarshuis 30) This game is drifting away from the Saffas
  thanks to a wonderful partnership. A reminder that Australia were 89-6. If
  things continue like this Australia will walk over the line! This Markram over
  only goes for two runs, but with Marsh waiting for his moment to strike the
  game is in the balance. 29th over: Australia 149-6 (Marsh 75, Dwarshuis 25)
  Burger returns with the job of knocking over Dwarshuis but he starts by
  getting spanked for two fours in a row. Too much width on offer and Dwarshuis
  can free his hands while staying inside the line. Burger straights but then
  strays again, giving up an easy single out in the deep. Two more singles means
  that 11 from the over. The partnership is now up to 64. 28th over: Australia
  142-6 (Marsh 74, Dwarshuis 19) Marsh drops to one knee and lifts Markram for
  four behind square on the leg side. He then leans back and takes two down to
  deep point. Momentum is shifting towards the home side. Feels like South
  Africa are just passively waiting for a mistake. 27th over: Australia 136-6
  (Marsh 68, Dwarshuis 19) Maharaj signs off with figures of 10-1-33-5. At once
  stage he had 5-9 from five overs. This final set was worth three runs.
  Brilliant bowling but the Saffas are letting this drift a little. 26th over:
  Australia 133-6 (Marsh 65, Dwarshuis 18) It’s starting to feel a little easy
  for the Aussies. Another Markram comes and goes without any fuss. Seven
  comfortable runs picked up by the batters. Dwarshuis seems at ease. After
  Maharaj’s final over coming up I’d be bringing back the quicks. 25th over:
  Australia 125-6 (Marsh 61, Dwarshuis 16) Maharaj will bowl through. Fair play.
  Just two runs off that over. Twice Marsh goes back to full balls – one was
  practically a half volley – and twice he has to jam the bat down quickly to
  avoid getting trapped lbw or bowled. Is it the flight? Is it the pace? Is it a
  deliberate ploy that the Aussies have adopted? Not sure it’s the right
  approach. Something to keep an eye on as we build towards a World Cup in Sri
  Lanka. 24th over: Australia 123-6 (Marsh 60, Dwarshuis 14) South Africa are
  rattling through the overs. Either way we’ll be done pretty soon. Marsh is
  ticking along at more than a run a ball. Just two singles from this Markram
  over who is tidy without being penetrating. The required rate is now hovering
  closer to seven than six. 23rd over: Australia 121-6 (Marsh 59, Dwarshuis 13)
  Maharaj seems to be flagging a bit but he almost gets Dwarshuis. One ripped
  back into the lefty and clipped the pad. There’s a half appeal but it was
  turning too much. Then there’s a chance of a catch at short mid-on but it
  lands just short. A wide down the leg, a couple through midwicket and a single
  for both batters adds up to five off the over. Maybe time to give Kesh a
  breather? 22nd over: Australia 116-6 (Marsh 58, Dwarshuis 10) Markram replaces
  Subrayen. Marsh leans back and pierces the small gap between point and cover,
  collecting another boundary. Markram gets one to turn back into the
  right-hander but that over is won by the Aussies who bagged seven runs from
  it. After the dramatic collapse, they’ve scored 24-0 from the last five overs.
  21st over: Australia 109-6 (Marsh 52, Dwarshuis 9) The scoreboard keeps
  ticking along and Marsh has his half century. So it’s not game over as far as
  the Aussies are concerned. A four through the covers from Marsh shows that
  there are runs to be had. Maharaj has bowled seven overs, picked up five
  wickets and coughed up a miserly 23 runs. Job’s not done, but that’s something
  to cheer. A rare poor ball from Maharaj is duly spanked off the back foot
  through the covers. Marsh is subdued as he raises his bat. He knows there’s
  plenty left to do. 20th over: 102-6 (Marsh 47, Dwarshuis 8) Tidy yet again
  from Subrayen. One was tossed up and beat Marsh in the flight, but the big
  unit was well forward and could reach it away from his body. He collects a
  couple with a nicely placed cut into the deep. Three singles elsewhere means
  the scoreboard ticks along. 19th over: Australia 98-6 (Marsh 44, Dwarshuis 6)
  Once again a batter goes back to a Maharaj delivery that shoots through from a
  fullish length. Marsh, unlike his mates, manages to get his bat down and keep
  it out. Four singles from that over. The required rate is only a touch over 6.
  But it is climbing. 18th over: Australia 94-6 (Marsh 42, Dwarshuis 4) Subrayen
  should have had another. But his spin mate shelled a sitter at cover.
  Dwasrshuis pressed forward and lazily swatted at it. Maharaj must have been
  thinking of hauling in Imran Tahir’s record figures of 7-45. Just one run off
  that over, a single to Marsh. It’s not a perfect night for Kesh. Standing at
  extra cover I reckon his mind was elsewhere as he reacted slowly to that
  Dwarshuis drive to Subrayen. 17th over: Australia 93-6 (Marsh 41, Dwarshuis 4)
  It’s Marsh or bust now for Australia. Maharaj has a wicket for every over he’s
  bowled but he leaves this annoyed after new batter Dwarshuis smokes his first
  bad ball for four through the covers. MAHARAJ HAS A FIVE-FOR! It’s his first
  in ODI cricket. It’s a ripper. Another one. Hardie presses forward, playing
  down a straight line to cover the drift towards him. But it grips in the
  surface and spins past the outside edge, clipping off-stump. The commentators
  are giving the Aussie batters pelters but all the credit should be going to
  Maharaj who is putting on a masterclass. Sensational bowling. He has 5-9 from
  4.2 overs. Unreal. 16th over: Australia 89-5 (Marsh 42, Hardie 4) Marsh rocks
  back and spoons a pull shot over Bavuma at backward square leg. It bobbles
  away for the first boundary since the seventh over. Hardie’s outside edge gets
  him a single which means there’s six runs off that Subrayen set. 15th over:
  Australia 83-5 (Marsh 36, Hardie 3) Marsh goes back to another full from
  Maharaj and almost gets trapped lbw. Not sure why the Aussies are so
  determined to play on the back foot to him. Though it’s easy to question
  techniques sitting on the couch. There’s a cry of ‘caaaatch’ as Marsh mistimes
  a drive into the covers. It’s wide of the fielder and they collect a single,
  one of four through the over. Maharaj has figures of 4-9 from his four overs.
  14th over: Australia 79-5 (Marsh 34, Hardie 1) Subrayen isn’t as destructive
  as Maharaj, but he’s doing a great job keeping things tight at the other end.
  Marsh works a couple through the off-side after making room and then both
  batters collect singles. 13th over: Australia 75-5 (Marsh 31, Hardie 0) A
  double wicket maiden from Maharaj. Brilliant bowling. The Aussies don’t know
  whether to play forward or back to him. Some are skidding. Some are floating.
  Most are turning off the pitch. Just brilliant bowling by a finger spinner at
  the top of his game. Marsh has to play something close to the innings of his
  life to get his team over the line from here. Carey is gone first ball! He’s
  been yorked by Majaraj. Rather, he’s yorked himself by sweeping a full ball on
  leg stump. Maharaj went up straight away with a huge appeal. He knew it was
  out. Carey reviewed but that was hitting the top of middle. Australia have
  lost five wickets for 15 runs. Maharaj has four of them and is on a hat-trick.
  THE FINGER GOES UP! Maharaj is convinced he’s bagged Carey first ball! A full
  ball, almost a yorker, is swept but misses the bat and hits the front pad.
  Looks out. It’s given out. Carey reviews but I reckon he’s a goner. Maharaj is
  on fire! Inglis plays back to a ball that was too full to do so. Pushed
  through a little quicker by Maharaj who seemed to know exactly what Inglis was
  going to do. The Australian was in no position to play that through the covers
  and is castled, looking pretty ordinary in the process. From 60 for no loss
  the Aussies are 15-4 since the 8th over. 12th over: Australia 75-3 (Marsh 31,
  Inglis 5) Subrayen almost beats Marsh who went back to a full ball and just
  about got his bat down in time. There were five singles across the set before
  that. Inglis needs to dig in here and keep the striking turning. 11th over:
  Australia 70-3 (Marsh 29, Inglis 2) South Africa have turned this around.
  Actually, South Africa’s spinners have turned this around. Maharaj is so good.
  He just knows exactly what he needs to do. Green looked befuddled as he left
  the field, unsure how he missed that. A big job now for the Aussies to
  rebuild. Bavuma’s gamble of playing two spinners is paying off. And another
  one! In a flash South Africa are all over the Aussies. Maharaj floats it up to
  Green with pace off. It grips in the surface and turns past Green’s meek
  forward prod, clattering the stumps behind him. Another ripper from Maharaj.
  10th over: Australia 67-2 (Marsh 28, Green 3) Another tidy one from Subrayen.
  Just three singles off that one. South Africa’s tweakers are putting the
  squeeze on. 9th over: Australia 63-2 (Marsh 26, Green 1) Well, what a
  difference a couple of overs can make. Two wickets from two spinners has South
  Africa back in this one. Maharaj got Marnus with a ripper and almost squeezed
  one past Green first up. Cam got off the mark with a single and Marsh also
  added one to the total with a toe-end drive down the ground. That is a jaffa!
  What a beauty from Maharaj. His first ball drifts towards Labuschagne before
  ripping across him. Marnus was totally squared up and played all around it
  with a push from the bottom hand. He’s had his struggles against left-arm
  spinners but there’s no shame going out to that one. He reviewed but never
  looked confident. Three reds confirm it was hitting the top of off after
  pitching on leg. Sometimes you just have to give credit to the bowler. Marnus
  is pinned on the pads and is given out! He reviews, but doesn’t look
  confident. Marahaj, bowling his first ball, was convinced. Let’s see…. 8th
  over: Australia 61-1 (Marsh 25, Labuschagne 1) A great over from Subrayen
  turns momentum slightly back towards the Saffas with a crucial wicket. Marnus,
  back in the team, takes five balls to get off the mark with a smear wide of
  mid-off. From nowhere! That was totally against the run of play. Credit to the
  bowler who slowed the pace right down, perhaps spotting that Head was eager to
  charge down the track. It also held up in the pitch and by the time Head
  reached it he was in no position to play the heave over the leg side. A simple
  job for the keeper behind the stumps gets the breakthrough South Africa
  desperately needed. 7th over: Australia 60-0 (Head 27, Marsh 25) A change of
  ends for Ngidi but it’s still a handy over for the Aussies. It was more or
  less tidy, despite a leg side wide, until Marsh came on strike for the last
  ball. The big opener once again spotted the slower ball early and climbed into
  a lash through the off side for four. 6th over: Australia 53-0 (Head 26, Marsh
  21) Bavuma has no choice but to go to spin early, tossing the ball to Prenelen
  Subrayen inside the powerplay. The Aussies are watchful, taking just three
  singles down the ground. Some neat fielding by Maharaj in the covers keeps
  things tidy. 5th over: Australia 50-0 (Head 25, Marsh 19) Burger takes a
  pasting. Five boundaries in the set. One was a genuine edge off Head’s bat,
  but the rest were all crunched off the middle. He started by swatting down the
  ground, then there was a wide before a heave over midwicket. Next came the
  edge before two thumps through the off-side. 4th over: Australia 29-0 (Head 5,
  Marsh 19) This was a better over from Ngidi who kept Head quiet, reducing him
  to just a sliced single down to deep third. Then a slower ball was served up
  to Marsh who pressed forward and belted it over cover for four. Bavuma has his
  hands on his hips. This is threatening to get out of hand early on for the
  tourists. 3rd over: Australia 24-0 (Head 4, Marsh 15) Marsh throws his hand at
  the first delivery he faces from Burger and flashes it over point for four.
  Burger straightens and gets Marsh lunging forward, finding the inside half of
  the bat, but the burly Aussie gets enough wood on it to see it trickle towards
  the midwicket boundary. A bumper brings out a hoik and a top edge, but it
  lands safely in deep in front of fine leg. Good start for Australia. 2nd over:
  Australia 14-0 (Head 4, Marsh 5) Lungi Ngidi opens the other end. He’s got it
  swinging early but one starts too straight and continues to hoop down the leg
  side, flying wide of a diving Rickelton for five runs. Ngidi tightens up but
  Marsh, hanging on the back foot, picks one up and hoists it towards cow corner
  for a one-bounce four. A single towards mid-on keeps him on strike. 1st over:
  Australia 4-0 (Head 4, Marsh 0) Burger is over the wicket to Head looking to
  angle it back into the Aussie. It’s quick – around the mid 140s – but there’s
  width on offer. Twice Head picks out the fielders in a packed off-side but he
  threads the needle with a lashing drive and hits the first boundary of the
  chase. Burger v Head. Lefty v lefty. Lovely stuff. And they’re off! The
  Proteas have gathered on the boundary. They’re ready to let rip. No Rabada so
  a big job for some of the deupities. I’m really excited to see Nandre Burger
  let rip with that meaty left arm of his. And with two spinners in the mix this
  could be interesting during the middle overs. It’ll be a good chase from here
  but I’m going to stick my neck out and say Australia get there with a couple
  overs to spare. Thanks Martin, a top innings from you mate. Hello everyone.
  The commentators, including Martin, reckon this is a handy total by the
  Saffas. It is a record total on this ground, so there’s that. But this feels
  about 20 to 30 short for me. Maybe that’s me being a pessimist after the
  shocking trio of results for my countrymen over the weekend. (Please, no
  mention of the rugby, the T20 cricket or the loss of Dricus du Plessis, I
  promise my Aussie mates have given me enough stick already). So, can the
  bowlers give the Rainbow Nation something to smile about? We’ll find out soon
  enough. Thanks for following along through the first half of this ODI. Fans in
  the Top End have already enjoyed three exciting white-ball matches and another
  looks to be on the cards in Cairns. Daniel Gallan will take the reins from
  here as Australia chase a tricky target. South Africa opener Aiden Markram was
  in total control from the get-go to compile 82 from 81 balls before giving up
  his wicket with a thin edge to the keeper, while skipper Temba Bavuma added 65
  while steering his side through the middle overs. Matthew Breetzke (57) was
  just about to get motoring when he holed out in the deep but Australia would
  have breathed a sigh of relief when Dewald Brevis (6) was caught second ball
  in his ODI debut. Josh Hazlewood (0-36) clamped down with a typically tight
  line and length as South Africa were happy to see off the quick, but few would
  have predicted Travis Head (4-57) doing most of the damage. Australia like to
  chase – especially when Mitch Marsh has the reins – and will like their
  chances of reaching their target under lights even after South Africa compiled
  the highest total of the six ODIs that have been played at the venue. Wiaan
  Mulder ends the South Africa innings with a huge six to lift the tourists to
  296-8. It was just the third six of the innings as South Africa relied on more
  sensible batting to build a record total at Cazalys Stadium without taking too
  many risks. Travis Head, you can’t do that! Or can he? Wiaan Mulder plays a
  straight drive and the ball deflects off Head’s right hand and onto the stumps
  at the non-striker’s end. Whether Head meant it or not, only he will truly
  know. But he appears to have cupped his hand to direct the ball behind him,
  and is certainly a freakish enough cricketer that I’m willing to back him in.
  49th over: South Africa 285-8 (Mulder 22, Burger 0) Keshav Maharaj steps back
  to give himself room but can only slice the shot to Cameron Green inside the
  long-off boundary. Travis Head has four wickets and three balls remaining to
  claim his first ODI five-for. 48th over: South Africa 281-6 (Mulder 21,
  Maharaj 11) Nathan Ellis is back again and bowling to Keshav Maharaj. The
  South Africa spinner sees off a couple of dot balls before swinging wildly for
  a hard-earned single. Maharaj ends the over back on strike and clubs Ellis to
  the mid-off boundary. Ellis ends wicketless and goes for 54 runs from his 10
  overs. 47th over: South Africa 275-6 (Mulder 20, Maharaj 6) South Africa have
  posted the highest-score in the six ODIs that have been held at Cazalys
  Stadium though the sense is that they have left too many behind with some
  overly cautious batting. Four singles from Zampa’s 10th over and he finishes
  with 1 for 58. 46th over: South Africa 271-6 (Mulder 18, Maharaj 4) Ben
  Dwarshuis perhaps outsmarts Temba Bavuma with some clever bowling around the
  wicket to leave South Africa on the ropes for the death overs. Keshav Maharaj
  gets off the mark with an unconvincing thick edge that races to the third man
  boundary. The skipper has been the glue in the South Africa innings but they
  will have to complete their overs without a recognised batter. Dwarshuis comes
  around the wicket and angles the ball across Bavuma who drags it back onto his
  stumps. 45th over: South Africa 264-5 (Bavuma 64, Mulder 17) Wiaan Mulder
  hammers a square drive off one knee all the way to the rope. That was as much
  class and timing as it was power, and one of the shots of the day. South
  Africa use the gaps well to make it a low-risk but reasonable-reward over.
  44th over: South Africa 253-5 (Bavuma 58, Mulder 12) Wiaan Mulder finds a
  much-needed boundary with a clever late cut that races away to the boundary.
  Another four from a pull shot makes this South Africa’s best over for a long
  stretch. It has been a slow burn but 300 could still be on the cards. 43rd
  over: South Africa 242-5 (Bavuma 53, Mulder 6) A stoic knock from Temba Bavuma
  hasn’t been one to set the hearts racing but the South Africa skipper deserves
  credit for guiding the innings as he reaches a half-century. A sweep picks up
  two runs to take him past fifty off 64 balls. 42nd over: South Africa 236-5
  (Bavuma 49, Mulder 4) Nathan Ellis is back on and so are the South African
  struggles with lifting the run rate. The visitors are suddenly looking short
  on wickets but four singles are not quite what is needed at this late stage.
  Dewald Brevis finally gets his shot in his ODI and quickly learns that if you
  live by the sword you can die by the sword. The South African rising star
  sends his first ball over Travis Head and well and truly over the rope. But
  his second shot doesn’t have enough on it against a stiff breeze and Alex
  Carey takes the catch just inside the long-on boundary. That was certainly
  entertaining. But not sure that was worth the wait. 41st over: South Africa
  232-5 (Bavuma 47, Mulder 2) Tristan Stubbs is straight on the attack as he
  steps back to give himself room but mis-times a loft that flies straight to
  Cameron Green at long-off. 40th over: South Africa 223-3 (Bavuma 46, Stubbs 0)
  Adam Zampa is back on as the bowling changes keep South Africa on their toes.
  Some lazy running between wickets almost leads to a dismissal, before the
  leg-spinner strikes to send Matthew Breetzke on his way. Matthew Breetzke is
  done with waiting and seeks to lift the run rate. But the right-hander gets
  too far under a slog sweep and a top edge sails high to Aaron Hardie in the
  deep. Tristan Stubbs comes out while Australia perhaps won’t mind South
  Africa’s big-hitting star of the T20 series Dewald Brevis being left to bide
  his time. 39th over: South Africa 216-2 (Bavuma 45, Breetzke 51) Matthew
  Breetzke looks the more likely to get South Africa’s innings rocking and the
  right-hander raises his bat for the third time in as many internationals in
  the format. The 26-year-old now has two fifties and a ton from his three ODIs
  with time on his side to reach triple figures again. This half-century comes
  with a glance off Hazlewood to the rope. Bavuma adds another boundary with one
  of the shots of the day as he steps back and gets under a smash over cover.
  38th over: South Africa 206-2 (Bavuma 40, Breetzke 46) Australia’s bowlers are
  on top as their variety in pace, line and length leaves the South Africa
  batters struggling to get them away. Temba Bavuma in particular seems to be
  eating up the deliveries with his 40 coming from 56 balls while the real
  firepower sits idle in the sheds. 37th over: South Africa 202-2 (Bavuma 39,
  Breetzke 43) It doesn’t get any easier for the South Africa duo as Josh
  Hazlewood returns. Breetzke finds a boundary with a loft over mid-off that
  might not have been timed perfectly but still reaches the rope along a dry
  outfield. Hazlewood has gone for 26 runs off seven overs so far. 36th over:
  South Africa 195-2 (Bavuma 37, Breetzke 39) Nathan Ellis brings out all his
  tricks as the South Africa pair seem to be trying to lift the run rate but
  have trouble getting the quick away. The visitors have plenty of fireworks in
  the sheds but are running out of overs to let them do their full damage. 35th
  over: South Africa 191-2 (Bavuma 36, Breetzke 38) Aaron Hardie is recalled for
  his second over after going for 13 runs off his first much earlier in the
  innings. And the South Africans seem intent on targeting the medium-pacer
  again with Bavuma leading the way. The skipper steps down the pitch to loft
  Hardie over cover to the rope before the Australian responds with a quicker
  ball that almost finds a way through. A word here and there suggests a nice
  little battle could be brewing between the pair. 34th over: South Africa 184-2
  (Bavuma 31, Breetzke 36) Matthew Breetzke is moving now. Nathan Ellis mixes up
  his pace and length but the South African quickly picks up a shorter ball to
  casually square drive it to the rope. That’s drinks with this game evenly
  poised. 33rd over: South Africa 179-2 (Bavuma 31, Breetzke 31) Matthew
  Breetzke targets Labuschagne and dispatches the part-timer for much-needed
  back-to-back boundaries. A full toss firstly gets what it deserves as Breetzke
  sends it square to the rope but the next almost leads to his dismissal as the
  ball is hit high and over Alex Carey at deep midwicket. The Test keeper seems
  to lose the ball in the sun but might not have picked up the flight early
  enough. 32nd over: South Africa 169-2 (Bavuma 30, Breetzke 22) Zampa has
  clamped down on the South Africa skipper but Bavuma finally finds a boundary
  with a sweep that beats Hazlewood at backward square. 31st over: South Africa
  164-2 (Bavuma 25, Breetzke 22) Marnus Labuschagne takes the ball for the first
  time today as spin continues to contain the flow of runs. Four singles are all
  that South Africa can find off the part-timer as the overs now feel like they
  are ticking away. 30th over: South Africa 160-2 (Bavuma 23, Breetzke 20) Fast
  glovework from Josh Inglis might have caught Temba Bavuma out of his crease as
  the review is sent upstairs. The South Africa skipper was out of his crease
  but has just managed to get his trailed foot back in time. 29th over: South
  Africa 155-2 (Bavuma 20, Breetzke 18) Travis Head returns but a sublime cover
  drive from Matthew Breetzke races away to the boundary as South Africa begin
  to build another strong partnership. 28th over: South Africa 149-2 (Bavuma 19,
  Breetzke 13) SIX! Breetzke takes a step down the crease and clobbers Dwarshuis
  toward a vacant long-on and beyond the rope. That was sweetly timed and just
  what South Africa needed. Bavuma joins in with a pull shot but his timing is
  off a little and the skipper has to settle for two. 27th over: South Africa
  139-2 (Bavuma 16, Breetzke 6) A trademark Josh Hazlewood over limits South
  Africa to another three singles. A pull shot from each batter is the closest
  they come to testing the Australia quick’s length. 26th over: South Africa
  136-2 (Bavuma 15, Breetzke 4) Ben Dwarshuis sends down another tidy six
  deliveries as the South Africa batters keep searching for singles but can only
  add three. 25th over: South Africa 133-2 (Bavuma 14, Breetzke 2) Josh
  Hazlewood comes back into the attack as Australia look to turn the screws.
  Breetzke takes time to pick up the line before finding a single to mid-off.
  24th over: South Africa 132-2 (Bavuma 14, Breetzke 1) Ben Dwarshuis gets the
  breakthrough that Australia needed but it’s not enough to bring Dewald Brevis
  to the crease as Matthew Breetzke joins the skipper in his third ODI. Aiden
  Markram gives up much of his hard work as he feathers a dab to Josh Inglis
  behind the stumps. The South Africa opener is on his way for a classy 82 off
  81 balls with nine boundaries, though he will rue not making a bigger score
  after looking so composed. 23rd over: South Africa 130-1 (Markram 82, Bavuma
  13) Zampa screams for a catch as the ball flies off the toe of Markram’s bat
  before falling safely over midwicket. That’s the closest Australia have come
  to a second wicket for some time as the alarm bells start ringing. 22nd over:
  South Africa 124-1 (Markram 78, Bavuma 11) Mitch Marsh keeps ringing the
  changes as Australia get increasingly desperate for a breakthrough. Ben
  Dwarshuis comes back for his second spell after going for 16 runs from his
  first three overs. South Africa keep picking up the singles with another five
  off Dwarshuis. 21st over: South Africa 119-1 (Markram 75, Bavuma 9) Adam Zampa
  comes back into the attack as Australia need to not only restrict the run rate
  but perhaps even find a couple of wickets. Both batters work their way around
  the crease to work with the spin and ease to five singles. 20th over: South
  Africa 114-1 (Markram 72, Bavuma 7) Temba Bavuma is yet to really find his
  timing but puts any concerns aside as he pulls Nathan Ellis over midwicket for
  his first boundary. The South Africa batters pick out the gaps from there for
  another five singles. 19th over: South Africa 106-1 (Markram 70, Bavuma 1)
  Markram hammers Head with a cover drive that gets airborne but is never in any
  danger as it bounces toward the boundary. The opener finds another four when
  guiding the ball to third man and is now putting together a fine knock without
  his usual big-hitting fanfare. 18th over: South Africa 95-1 (Markram 60,
  Bavuma 1) Nathan Ellis takes over from Adam Zampa who has bowled three overs
  for 15 runs while troubling the South Africa openers. Bavuma is keen to get
  off the mark after a punch to mid-on. 17th over: South Africa 92-1 (Markram
  58, Bavuma 0) South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma joins Aiden Markram at the
  crease with their side perhaps getting ready for take off. But the Australia
  spinners are proving hard to get away and Bavuma will likely to take to get
  his eye in while Markram keeps the score ticking over. Australia finally get a
  breakthrough as Ryan Rickelton steps down the track but can only loft his
  drive to Marnus Labuschagne at mid-off. The opener had not looked comfortable
  against the spinners but he has helped set up South Africa for some fireworks
  through the next two-thirds of the innings. 16th over: South Africa 85-0
  (Markram 51, Rickelton 33) Aiden Markram passes 50 for the 16th time in 78
  ODIs with a lofted drive over cover. Labuschagne saves the boundary with a
  dive near the rope but the three runs are enough for the opener’s half-century
  from 54 balls with six fours. 15th over: South Africa 80-0 (Markram 47,
  Rickelton 32) Rickelton gets another life! A thick outside edge is too sharp
  for Josh Inglis behind the stumps as the nick takes the ball away from the
  keeper’s gloves. 14th over: South Africa 76-0 (Markram 45, Rickelton 30)
  Australia loses a review after Zampa has Rickelton swinging wildly and hits
  him on the pads. That might have been out by the ball pitched just outside leg
  stump to the left-hander, who looks in all sorts against the Australian
  spinners. 13th over: South Africa 71-0 (Markram 42, Rickelton 28) Head drops
  one right on the spot as the ball drifts into, and then spins away from,
  Rickelton. The left-hander misses the attempted sweep and the finger goes up,
  but the review shows the ball bounced narrowly over middle stump. Rickelton
  looks unsure how to handle Head until deciding the best form of defence is to
  attack. The South African opener dances down the deck and lofts the ball back
  over Head and only narrowly beyond deep mid-on. 12th over: South Africa 67-0
  (Markram 41, Rickelton 25) It’s spin from both ends as Adam Zampa is also
  called into the attack. The Australia leg-spinner doesn’t even bother to hide
  his displeasure at a misfield from Mitch Marsh at point costs him two runs.
  The South Africans are left working the gaps for a few singles. 11th over:
  South Africa 62-0 (Markram 37, Rickelton 24) With the powerplay complete Mitch
  Marsh immediately turns to spin as Travis Head takes the ball and begins
  around the wicket. Markram sits back and cuts hard to beat the fielder at deep
  point in an otherwise tidy over. 10th over: South Africa 56-0 (Markram 32,
  Rickelton 23) Nathan Ellis turns the screws with a tighter over and almost
  sends Rickelton on his way with a slower ball after the opener gets a thick
  inside edge on a square drive but somehow misses his stumps. Both sides might
  be happy with the powerplay as Australia restrict South Africa to only eight
  boundaries but the visitors have their full set of wickets in hand. 9th over:
  South Africa 54-0 (Markram 31, Rickelton 22) Aaron Hardie takes over from Josh
  Hazlewood who could hardly have been more impressive while going wicketless.
  Markram sends a loosener past the fielder at deep point, before Rickelton adds
  another boundary with a glance off the hip. South Africa might have taken
  their time to get the run rate moving, but they will be pleased to have seen
  off Australia’s new ball bowlers with all 10 wickets still in hand. 8th over:
  South Africa 41-0 (Markram 25, Rickelton 15) Nathan Ellis comes into the
  attack as Mitch Marsh makes his first move. Markram greets the Australia quick
  with a sublime straight drive that races away to the boundary. Rickelton adds
  another four with a well-time square drive through point. South Africa needed
  an over like that. 7th over: South Africa 32-0 (Markram 20, Rickelton 11) Alex
  Carey is at it again as the Test keeper chases down a Rickelton square drive
  just inside the rope to save a run. Markram looks to get the score moving –
  finally – with a pull over midwicket but the ball goes as high as it does long
  and barely moves after it crashes to the turf just short of the boundary. 6th
  over: South Africa 25-0 (Markram 16, Rickelton 8) Alex Carey is called back
  into action in the field as Ryan Rickelton takes off for a risky single that
  very nearly costs the opener his wicket. The ball bounces to Carey’s left and
  the time it takes him to get around it to pick up with his right and get a
  throw away is enough to pile on the pressure as the ball sails narrowly wide.
  Rickelton would have been out with a direct hit. 5th over: South Africa 20-0
  (Markram 11, Rickelton 8) Alex Carey scampers across the outfield unusually
  without the wicketkeeping gloves and pads as Josh Inglis lines up behind the
  stumps. The Australian chases down a drive from Rickelton inside the rope and
  drops the ball neatly over the stumps as if to prove he can do it all. The
  South Africa openers still don’t look comfortable against Hazlewood but will
  be happy to pick up four runs from the over. 4th over: South Africa 16-0
  (Markram 10, Rickelton 5) A tighter line from Ben Dwarshuis has Aiden Markram
  playing with caution until the final delivery when the South African punishes
  a wider ball with a square drive to the boundary. 3rd over: South Africa 11-0
  (Markram 6, Rickelton 5) Aiden Markram finally opens up as he caresses a
  square drive across a lightning quick outfield to send the ball crashing into
  the rope. The South Africa opener repeats the stroke with a touch more power
  but it bounces straight to point. 2nd over: South Africa 6-0 (Markram 1,
  Rickelton 5) Ben Dwarshuis takes the new ball in his first ODI on home soil
  and the South Africa openers find the drop in pace easier to get away. Ryan
  Rickelton opens the scoring with a thick edge before Aiden Markram gets off
  the mark with a single to mid-off. The first contender for shot of the day
  goes to Rickelton as he uses the swing away from him to hammer a cover drive
  to the rope. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Markram 0, Rickelton 0) Josh
  Hazlewood does what he does best and immediately locks into a perfect line and
  length against Aiden Markram. The Australian metronome begins with a
  top-quality first over. That’s a maiden. Josh Hazlewood is at the top of his
  mark with Aiden Markram on strike. Here we go … The wind is blowing hard
  across Cazalys Stadium which should please Australia’s quicks including Josh
  Hazlewood, Ben Dwarshuis and Nathan Ellis who each impressed in the T20
  series. Openers Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton are also heading to the
  crease with the former especially in need of runs after scoring only 31 in
  three knocks while leading South Africa in the T20 series. Australia will play
  this ODI in the shadow of former captain and coach Bob Simpson who was
  critical to turning the side’s fortunes around alongside Allan Border after a
  lean patch through the 1980s. Simpson died aged 89 after also playing 62 Tests
  for Australia over more than two decades. Mike Selvey has written in depth
  about one of the greats of Australian cricket. Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton
  (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Matthew Breetzke, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Wiaan
  Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Prenelan Subrayen, Nandre Burger, Lungi Ngidi. Dewald
  Brevis is named for his ODI debut with Prenelan Subrayen also playing his
  first 50-over international as South Africa go with two spinners. Mitch Marsh
  (c), Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex
  Carey, Aaron Hardie, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood.
  Marnus Labuschagne returns to the lineup hoping that white-ball runs might
  press his claims for a place in the Ashes squad, while Alex Carey comes in as
  a specialist batter. South Africa captain Temba Bavuma calls “heads” but tails
  comes up. Mitch Marsh has a huge call to make but for the 21st time as
  Australia captain he says, “just thought I’d change it up and say that we’ll
  have a bowl first”. The Australia captain explains that the decision is based
  on more than just habit. “The wicket looks a touch drier than the other night
  but we saw that the dew plays a part so that’s the main reason why,” Marsh
  adds. Bavuma admits that he would have liked to bat first, but is happier to
  announce that Dewald Brevis will make his ODI debut. “He’s the star of the
  show at the moment, it would be nice if he could carry on with his heroics in
  the ODI format,” the Proteas skipper says. Dewald Brevis is expected to make
  his ODI debut for South Africa today - after smashing 125 not out and 53 in
  the last couple of T20s against Australia. The Proteas could do with Brevis’s
  power hitting after their bowling stocks suffered a huge blow when Kagiso
  Rabada was ruled out of the ODI series. The toss will be coming up in about
  five minutes – but it seems we can easily predict which way it will go if
  Mitch Marsh gets to decide whether Australia will bat or bowl first.
  Australia’s middle-order maverick Tim David and South Africa’s rising star
  Dewald Brevis lit up the T20s in Darwin, but it was left to a more familiar
  name in Glenn Maxwell to steer the hosts home with one ball to spare in the
  decider held in Cairns. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the first
  one-day international between Australia and South Africa at Cazalys Stadium.
  The focus turns to three matches in the 50-over format after a gripping T20
  series over the past couple of weeks that included some powerful hitting in
  Darwin then went into a decider held in Cairns. Glenn Maxwell was the hero
  with the bat as Australia clinched a T20 series victory last Saturday night,
  though the white-ball great will be missing from this group of games after
  retiring from ODIs with the next World Cup still two years away. There are a
  number of other changes to each squad as the teams give opportunities to fresh
  talent and aim to find the right mix and formula for the longer term.
  Australia’s designated ODI captain Pat Cummins is unavailable with Mitch Marsh
  again set to take the reins, while Temba Bavuma will lead South Africa just as
  he did when the sides met in the World Test Championship final a couple of
  months ago. The teams should be more familiar with the conditions in Cairns
  after playing at the same venue three days ago, while they will head to Mackay
  for the remaining two games in the ODI series to be played on Friday and
  Sunday. The forecast is for sunny skies all afternoon and a high of 25C before
  it barely cools for the second stanza. First ball will be at 2.30pm local time
  / AEST. The toss and team news will be coming up shortly. Meanwhile, let us
  know your thoughts and predictions – shoot me an email or find me @martinpegan

---
The report has landed and that’s my cue to get outta here. A comprehensive win for the Saffas who gave their compatriots back home a reason to smile after a pretty torrid weekend of sport. The Aussies will lick their wounds as they look to bounce back at the Great Barrier Reef Arena in Mackay on Friday. We’ll be back too, brining you every ball of the second ODI. 11 of the 18 wickets to fall went to spinners. Is this a sign that both teams struggle against the slower, turning ball? Is it just because of the pitch? The T20 World Cup is in Sri Lanka. The lessons learned in this ODI series could be pivotal. And now South Africa have a better record against Australia in Australia. Won 20, lost 19, tied one. In this format, South Africa have been utterly dominant over Australia. That’s not only four wins in a row in ODIs but 16 wins from the last 20 played against the Aussies. Colum Fordham has written in: This match provides further confirmation that South Africa’s victory over Australia in the World Test Championship was no fluke. Admittedly, this is a different format but the Proteas are becoming a much tougher nut to crack. Superb bowling from Maharaj, ably supported by Ngidi and Burger. What you said, Colum. Oh, and a shout out to Julian Menz, a Durban-born “Pom” (his words) who wrote in from “sunny Sweden”, watching the game with his “Indian mates”. Hope you enjoyed it Julez! Finally, it’s Temba Bavuma: A good all round performance from the boys. We were put in to bat and did well. The wicket was a bit two-paced. We put on a competitive score, the bowlers did their thing. It wasn’t a bad toss to lose. We didn’t expect it ti turn as much. Kesh showed his class there. The boys made me look good with the decision [to play two spinners]. Now Mitch Marsh: Keshav is an outstanding bowler. You just have to take your hat off to him. He won them the game. It wasn’t a lack of confidence. We’ve played spin well as a group. He bowled well. No prizes if you guess that Keshav Maharaj would win the player of the match award. Here’s what he has to say: I made my ODI debut in 2016 in Australia so it’s a special to get my first five-for [here]. The wicket was a little sticky. We just tried to utilise that and get the reward. The boys spoke that there was turn as the game went on. I just tried to use the angles. We’ve always been slow starters in series so it’s great to put the front foot forward. Shows what I know. I said that South Africa were perhaps 20 or 30 short. And when the Aussies were cruising at 60-0 loss I was confident in my call. But thenSubrayen had Head stumped before Maharaj went on the tear, bagging five wickets in five overs – three bowled, two lbw – to leave Australia in tatters at 89-6. That’s six wickets for just 29 runs in the space of nine overs. Mitch Marsh was brilliant for his 88. But he ran out of partners and fell in the quest of big blows. Credit to South Africa. They weren’t perfect with either bat or ball, but that is a pretty comprehensive win to get the series going. Ngidi rattles the stumps of Zampa! Full, straight and the swishing bat can’t make contact with it. Australia are bowled out in the 41st over for 198. They did well to fight back from 89-6 after Maharaj bagged a five-for in the blink of an eye, but it was always going to be too much for the lower order. That’s four in a row for South Africa over the Aussies in ODI cricket. It shoots low and Ellis is gone! But was this missing leg? It looked like it to the naked eye but there are no reviews left. Labuschagne and Carey burned them both earlier in the piece so Ellis has to go. Yup, missing leg stump. 40th over: Australia 196-8 (Ellis 14, Zampa 10) Subrayen closes out his night with 10-0-46-1. He should have had another wicket and will be annoyed that his last ball is spanked for six down the ground by Ellis who skipped down the track and timed it perfectly. It’s actually quite an expensive over, going for 11. Australia won’t get points for this but if these last two wickets can remain intact they’ll be delighted. Games within a game. 39th over: Australia 185-8 (Ellis 7, Zampa 6) Zampa edges Ngidi for four then bags a single after getting dropped in the covers by Stubbs. This is meandering now. South Africa are not showing a ruthlessness that is needed from them. For all their great work, the Saffas have allowed things to drift at times. Another drop! Stubbs shells a tough chance diving in the covers. Hmmm, maybe not so tough actually. Zampa drives on the up. It wasn’t a gimme but at this level that has to be taken. 38th over: Australia 180-8 (Ellis 7, Zampa 1) Subrayen returns. This game would have been over by now if Maharaj caught Dwarshuis off his bowling in the 17th over. But here we are. Ellis skips down the track and smears a four over cover. Two singles elsewhere. Can South Africa mop this up. They’ve had some issues with wagging tails. Time to put their foot down. 37th over: Australia 174-8 (Ellis 2, Zampa 0) A wicket maiden from Burger. He’s done superbly after getting serious tap in his opening spell. He’s stuck with this short length and on a deck that’s slowing up a touch he’s been difficult to hit. The wicket of a set Marsh will do his confidence the world of good. The drinks break brings the wicket and that’s the game! I think it’s safe to call this one now. Burger, who has been brilliant in his second spell, banged it in short but crucially got it outside the eye line of Marsh who was always looking to heave this across the line towards the leg side. Marsh has to reach for it and can only feather it behind for a simple catch. A wonderful innings comes to an end and with it Australia’s best hope. We’ve had an email about the umpire’s call conundrum. This from Henry North: I’m interested in what you mean about the review against Ellis. I get the point, but isn’t that presuming the umpire gives it not out because of the edge? Sometimes they indicate that, but it’s not formalised, is it? My memory of umpire’s call when it was introduced - how old we are - was not only that it left agency for the umpires, but that the technology, though good, was imperfect. I think overturning any decision close enough to be umpire’s call gets uncomfortably close to removing any margin for error, or presuming technological perfection. I quite like a margin for error, if it’s not too wide of a margin. Thanks mate. I guess what I was getting at is that if the umpire gave it as a run off the bat then he thought the batter hit it. Would he have given it out if he thought the batter missed it? Does that make sense? I’m starting to confuse myself. 36th over: Australia 174-7 (Marsh 88, Ellis 2) It’s getting nervy but there’s hope while Marsh is there. He’s been brilliant. Markram keeps him quiet with some shorter stuff but a spray down the leg side is easily swatted for four behind square. A single farms the strike off the last ball. A single earlier from Ellis – who faced two dots – means that’s six off the set. It’s short of the required rate of 8.78. 35th over: Australia 168-7 (Marsh 83, Ellis 1) Burger is hammering a short length, encouraging Marsh to hook with fielders stationed in the deep. Twice he declines the single, recognising that he needs to farm the strike. Once he skies a pull into the gap at cow corner. He then swivels a pull for two wide of fine leg. A wide over the head adds one to the total before Burger beats him for pace with another bumper. Just five off the over and Ellis will be on strike for the next one. A handy return from Burger who has come back well after an expensive start. 34th over: Australia 163-7 (Marsh 79, Ellis 1) Another great over from South Africa. Just two off it, one a leg-bye after Ellis was very lucky to survive an lbw shout. The umpire thought he hit it. Markram was convinced he didn’t. Markram was correct but the umpire’s call of not-out saved the Aussie. The required rate is now above eight. Marsh is not facing enough deliveries. Ellis survives the umpire’s call! But he’s given it not-out because he thought Ellis hit it. But the replays show that he didn’t hit it. So shouldn’t it be overturned? One for another day. There’s a review for lbw on Ellis. They run and it’s been given as a run off the bat. But the Saffas review. They think they’re in business here with Markram turning one back into the right hander… 33rd over: Australia 161-7 (Marsh 78, Ellis 1) South Africa needed that wicket. In fact they’ve done well to tighten things up in the last three overs. Marsh now has to do it all on his own and hope that his bowlers can hang around with him. The required rate is now up to eight. Just one off tha Burger over that also brought the wicket. They break the partnership! Burger digs it in short again but this time takes the pace off. Dwarshuis rocks back into position early but has to wait for it. He can’t time it and drags a dolly to Brevis at midwicket. I’d say that’s justice for escaping a stumping shout in the previous over. South Africa now back on top and taking aim at the bowlers. 32nd over: Australia 160-6 (Marsh 78, Dwarshuis 33) Markram beats Dwarshuis past the outside edge and Rickelton whips off the bails behind the stumps. The appea for stumped is sent upstairs and the third umpire makes his mind up very quickly, deciding that it was not-out. I thought it looked out, but what do I know? Three runs from it. Game is in the balance. 31st over: Australia 157-6 (Marsh 77, Dwarshuis 31) Burger is persisting with a short length but it’s not causing much fuss down at the other end. Marsh and Dwarshuis swat singles down in the deep. A diving Brevis twice prevents loose balls from going to the boundary. Just two runs off the over but, once again, it feels like a moral win for the Aussies who are looking more and more comfortable as this partnership swells. It’s up to 68. 30th over: Australia 155-6 (Marsh 76, Dwarshuis 30) This game is drifting away from the Saffas thanks to a wonderful partnership. A reminder that Australia were 89-6. If things continue like this Australia will walk over the line! This Markram over only goes for two runs, but with Marsh waiting for his moment to strike the game is in the balance. 29th over: Australia 149-6 (Marsh 75, Dwarshuis 25) Burger returns with the job of knocking over Dwarshuis but he starts by getting spanked for two fours in a row. Too much width on offer and Dwarshuis can free his hands while staying inside the line. Burger straights but then strays again, giving up an easy single out in the deep. Two more singles means that 11 from the over. The partnership is now up to 64. 28th over: Australia 142-6 (Marsh 74, Dwarshuis 19) Marsh drops to one knee and lifts Markram for four behind square on the leg side. He then leans back and takes two down to deep point. Momentum is shifting towards the home side. Feels like South Africa are just passively waiting for a mistake. 27th over: Australia 136-6 (Marsh 68, Dwarshuis 19) Maharaj signs off with figures of 10-1-33-5. At once stage he had 5-9 from five overs. This final set was worth three runs. Brilliant bowling but the Saffas are letting this drift a little. 26th over: Australia 133-6 (Marsh 65, Dwarshuis 18) It’s starting to feel a little easy for the Aussies. Another Markram comes and goes without any fuss. Seven comfortable runs picked up by the batters. Dwarshuis seems at ease. After Maharaj’s final over coming up I’d be bringing back the quicks. 25th over: Australia 125-6 (Marsh 61, Dwarshuis 16) Maharaj will bowl through. Fair play. Just two runs off that over. Twice Marsh goes back to full balls – one was practically a half volley – and twice he has to jam the bat down quickly to avoid getting trapped lbw or bowled. Is it the flight? Is it the pace? Is it a deliberate ploy that the Aussies have adopted? Not sure it’s the right approach. Something to keep an eye on as we build towards a World Cup in Sri Lanka. 24th over: Australia 123-6 (Marsh 60, Dwarshuis 14) South Africa are rattling through the overs. Either way we’ll be done pretty soon. Marsh is ticking along at more than a run a ball. Just two singles from this Markram over who is tidy without being penetrating. The required rate is now hovering closer to seven than six. 23rd over: Australia 121-6 (Marsh 59, Dwarshuis 13) Maharaj seems to be flagging a bit but he almost gets Dwarshuis. One ripped back into the lefty and clipped the pad. There’s a half appeal but it was turning too much. Then there’s a chance of a catch at short mid-on but it lands just short. A wide down the leg, a couple through midwicket and a single for both batters adds up to five off the over. Maybe time to give Kesh a breather? 22nd over: Australia 116-6 (Marsh 58, Dwarshuis 10) Markram replaces Subrayen. Marsh leans back and pierces the small gap between point and cover, collecting another boundary. Markram gets one to turn back into the right-hander but that over is won by the Aussies who bagged seven runs from it. After the dramatic collapse, they’ve scored 24-0 from the last five overs. 21st over: Australia 109-6 (Marsh 52, Dwarshuis 9) The scoreboard keeps ticking along and Marsh has his half century. So it’s not game over as far as the Aussies are concerned. A four through the covers from Marsh shows that there are runs to be had. Maharaj has bowled seven overs, picked up five wickets and coughed up a miserly 23 runs. Job’s not done, but that’s something to cheer. A rare poor ball from Maharaj is duly spanked off the back foot through the covers. Marsh is subdued as he raises his bat. He knows there’s plenty left to do. 20th over: 102-6 (Marsh 47, Dwarshuis 8) Tidy yet again from Subrayen. One was tossed up and beat Marsh in the flight, but the big unit was well forward and could reach it away from his body. He collects a couple with a nicely placed cut into the deep. Three singles elsewhere means the scoreboard ticks along. 19th over: Australia 98-6 (Marsh 44, Dwarshuis 6) Once again a batter goes back to a Maharaj delivery that shoots through from a fullish length. Marsh, unlike his mates, manages to get his bat down and keep it out. Four singles from that over. The required rate is only a touch over 6. But it is climbing. 18th over: Australia 94-6 (Marsh 42, Dwarshuis 4) Subrayen should have had another. But his spin mate shelled a sitter at cover. Dwasrshuis pressed forward and lazily swatted at it. Maharaj must have been thinking of hauling in Imran Tahir’s record figures of 7-45. Just one run off that over, a single to Marsh. It’s not a perfect night for Kesh. Standing at extra cover I reckon his mind was elsewhere as he reacted slowly to that Dwarshuis drive to Subrayen. 17th over: Australia 93-6 (Marsh 41, Dwarshuis 4) It’s Marsh or bust now for Australia. Maharaj has a wicket for every over he’s bowled but he leaves this annoyed after new batter Dwarshuis smokes his first bad ball for four through the covers. MAHARAJ HAS A FIVE-FOR! It’s his first in ODI cricket. It’s a ripper. Another one. Hardie presses forward, playing down a straight line to cover the drift towards him. But it grips in the surface and spins past the outside edge, clipping off-stump. The commentators are giving the Aussie batters pelters but all the credit should be going to Maharaj who is putting on a masterclass. Sensational bowling. He has 5-9 from 4.2 overs. Unreal. 16th over: Australia 89-5 (Marsh 42, Hardie 4) Marsh rocks back and spoons a pull shot over Bavuma at backward square leg. It bobbles away for the first boundary since the seventh over. Hardie’s outside edge gets him a single which means there’s six runs off that Subrayen set. 15th over: Australia 83-5 (Marsh 36, Hardie 3) Marsh goes back to another full from Maharaj and almost gets trapped lbw. Not sure why the Aussies are so determined to play on the back foot to him. Though it’s easy to question techniques sitting on the couch. There’s a cry of ‘caaaatch’ as Marsh mistimes a drive into the covers. It’s wide of the fielder and they collect a single, one of four through the over. Maharaj has figures of 4-9 from his four overs. 14th over: Australia 79-5 (Marsh 34, Hardie 1) Subrayen isn’t as destructive as Maharaj, but he’s doing a great job keeping things tight at the other end. Marsh works a couple through the off-side after making room and then both batters collect singles. 13th over: Australia 75-5 (Marsh 31, Hardie 0) A double wicket maiden from Maharaj. Brilliant bowling. The Aussies don’t know whether to play forward or back to him. Some are skidding. Some are floating. Most are turning off the pitch. Just brilliant bowling by a finger spinner at the top of his game. Marsh has to play something close to the innings of his life to get his team over the line from here. Carey is gone first ball! He’s been yorked by Majaraj. Rather, he’s yorked himself by sweeping a full ball on leg stump. Maharaj went up straight away with a huge appeal. He knew it was out. Carey reviewed but that was hitting the top of middle. Australia have lost five wickets for 15 runs. Maharaj has four of them and is on a hat-trick. THE FINGER GOES UP! Maharaj is convinced he’s bagged Carey first ball! A full ball, almost a yorker, is swept but misses the bat and hits the front pad. Looks out. It’s given out. Carey reviews but I reckon he’s a goner. Maharaj is on fire! Inglis plays back to a ball that was too full to do so. Pushed through a little quicker by Maharaj who seemed to know exactly what Inglis was going to do. The Australian was in no position to play that through the covers and is castled, looking pretty ordinary in the process. From 60 for no loss the Aussies are 15-4 since the 8th over. 12th over: Australia 75-3 (Marsh 31, Inglis 5) Subrayen almost beats Marsh who went back to a full ball and just about got his bat down in time. There were five singles across the set before that. Inglis needs to dig in here and keep the striking turning. 11th over: Australia 70-3 (Marsh 29, Inglis 2) South Africa have turned this around. Actually, South Africa’s spinners have turned this around. Maharaj is so good. He just knows exactly what he needs to do. Green looked befuddled as he left the field, unsure how he missed that. A big job now for the Aussies to rebuild. Bavuma’s gamble of playing two spinners is paying off. And another one! In a flash South Africa are all over the Aussies. Maharaj floats it up to Green with pace off. It grips in the surface and turns past Green’s meek forward prod, clattering the stumps behind him. Another ripper from Maharaj. 10th over: Australia 67-2 (Marsh 28, Green 3) Another tidy one from Subrayen. Just three singles off that one. South Africa’s tweakers are putting the squeeze on. 9th over: Australia 63-2 (Marsh 26, Green 1) Well, what a difference a couple of overs can make. Two wickets from two spinners has South Africa back in this one. Maharaj got Marnus with a ripper and almost squeezed one past Green first up. Cam got off the mark with a single and Marsh also added one to the total with a toe-end drive down the ground. That is a jaffa! What a beauty from Maharaj. His first ball drifts towards Labuschagne before ripping across him. Marnus was totally squared up and played all around it with a push from the bottom hand. He’s had his struggles against left-arm spinners but there’s no shame going out to that one. He reviewed but never looked confident. Three reds confirm it was hitting the top of off after pitching on leg. Sometimes you just have to give credit to the bowler. Marnus is pinned on the pads and is given out! He reviews, but doesn’t look confident. Marahaj, bowling his first ball, was convinced. Let’s see…. 8th over: Australia 61-1 (Marsh 25, Labuschagne 1) A great over from Subrayen turns momentum slightly back towards the Saffas with a crucial wicket. Marnus, back in the team, takes five balls to get off the mark with a smear wide of mid-off. From nowhere! That was totally against the run of play. Credit to the bowler who slowed the pace right down, perhaps spotting that Head was eager to charge down the track. It also held up in the pitch and by the time Head reached it he was in no position to play the heave over the leg side. A simple job for the keeper behind the stumps gets the breakthrough South Africa desperately needed. 7th over: Australia 60-0 (Head 27, Marsh 25) A change of ends for Ngidi but it’s still a handy over for the Aussies. It was more or less tidy, despite a leg side wide, until Marsh came on strike for the last ball. The big opener once again spotted the slower ball early and climbed into a lash through the off side for four. 6th over: Australia 53-0 (Head 26, Marsh 21) Bavuma has no choice but to go to spin early, tossing the ball to Prenelen Subrayen inside the powerplay. The Aussies are watchful, taking just three singles down the ground. Some neat fielding by Maharaj in the covers keeps things tidy. 5th over: Australia 50-0 (Head 25, Marsh 19) Burger takes a pasting. Five boundaries in the set. One was a genuine edge off Head’s bat, but the rest were all crunched off the middle. He started by swatting down the ground, then there was a wide before a heave over midwicket. Next came the edge before two thumps through the off-side. 4th over: Australia 29-0 (Head 5, Marsh 19) This was a better over from Ngidi who kept Head quiet, reducing him to just a sliced single down to deep third. Then a slower ball was served up to Marsh who pressed forward and belted it over cover for four. Bavuma has his hands on his hips. This is threatening to get out of hand early on for the tourists. 3rd over: Australia 24-0 (Head 4, Marsh 15) Marsh throws his hand at the first delivery he faces from Burger and flashes it over point for four. Burger straightens and gets Marsh lunging forward, finding the inside half of the bat, but the burly Aussie gets enough wood on it to see it trickle towards the midwicket boundary. A bumper brings out a hoik and a top edge, but it lands safely in deep in front of fine leg. Good start for Australia. 2nd over: Australia 14-0 (Head 4, Marsh 5) Lungi Ngidi opens the other end. He’s got it swinging early but one starts too straight and continues to hoop down the leg side, flying wide of a diving Rickelton for five runs. Ngidi tightens up but Marsh, hanging on the back foot, picks one up and hoists it towards cow corner for a one-bounce four. A single towards mid-on keeps him on strike. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Head 4, Marsh 0) Burger is over the wicket to Head looking to angle it back into the Aussie. It’s quick – around the mid 140s – but there’s width on offer. Twice Head picks out the fielders in a packed off-side but he threads the needle with a lashing drive and hits the first boundary of the chase. Burger v Head. Lefty v lefty. Lovely stuff. And they’re off! The Proteas have gathered on the boundary. They’re ready to let rip. No Rabada so a big job for some of the deupities. I’m really excited to see Nandre Burger let rip with that meaty left arm of his. And with two spinners in the mix this could be interesting during the middle overs. It’ll be a good chase from here but I’m going to stick my neck out and say Australia get there with a couple overs to spare. Thanks Martin, a top innings from you mate. Hello everyone. The commentators, including Martin, reckon this is a handy total by the Saffas. It is a record total on this ground, so there’s that. But this feels about 20 to 30 short for me. Maybe that’s me being a pessimist after the shocking trio of results for my countrymen over the weekend. (Please, no mention of the rugby, the T20 cricket or the loss of Dricus du Plessis, I promise my Aussie mates have given me enough stick already). So, can the bowlers give the Rainbow Nation something to smile about? We’ll find out soon enough. Thanks for following along through the first half of this ODI. Fans in the Top End have already enjoyed three exciting white-ball matches and another looks to be on the cards in Cairns. Daniel Gallan will take the reins from here as Australia chase a tricky target. South Africa opener Aiden Markram was in total control from the get-go to compile 82 from 81 balls before giving up his wicket with a thin edge to the keeper, while skipper Temba Bavuma added 65 while steering his side through the middle overs. Matthew Breetzke (57) was just about to get motoring when he holed out in the deep but Australia would have breathed a sigh of relief when Dewald Brevis (6) was caught second ball in his ODI debut. Josh Hazlewood (0-36) clamped down with a typically tight line and length as South Africa were happy to see off the quick, but few would have predicted Travis Head (4-57) doing most of the damage. Australia like to chase – especially when Mitch Marsh has the reins – and will like their chances of reaching their target under lights even after South Africa compiled the highest total of the six ODIs that have been played at the venue. Wiaan Mulder ends the South Africa innings with a huge six to lift the tourists to 296-8. It was just the third six of the innings as South Africa relied on more sensible batting to build a record total at Cazalys Stadium without taking too many risks. Travis Head, you can’t do that! Or can he? Wiaan Mulder plays a straight drive and the ball deflects off Head’s right hand and onto the stumps at the non-striker’s end. Whether Head meant it or not, only he will truly know. But he appears to have cupped his hand to direct the ball behind him, and is certainly a freakish enough cricketer that I’m willing to back him in. 49th over: South Africa 285-8 (Mulder 22, Burger 0) Keshav Maharaj steps back to give himself room but can only slice the shot to Cameron Green inside the long-off boundary. Travis Head has four wickets and three balls remaining to claim his first ODI five-for. 48th over: South Africa 281-6 (Mulder 21, Maharaj 11) Nathan Ellis is back again and bowling to Keshav Maharaj. The South Africa spinner sees off a couple of dot balls before swinging wildly for a hard-earned single. Maharaj ends the over back on strike and clubs Ellis to the mid-off boundary. Ellis ends wicketless and goes for 54 runs from his 10 overs. 47th over: South Africa 275-6 (Mulder 20, Maharaj 6) South Africa have posted the highest-score in the six ODIs that have been held at Cazalys Stadium though the sense is that they have left too many behind with some overly cautious batting. Four singles from Zampa’s 10th over and he finishes with 1 for 58. 46th over: South Africa 271-6 (Mulder 18, Maharaj 4) Ben Dwarshuis perhaps outsmarts Temba Bavuma with some clever bowling around the wicket to leave South Africa on the ropes for the death overs. Keshav Maharaj gets off the mark with an unconvincing thick edge that races to the third man boundary. The skipper has been the glue in the South Africa innings but they will have to complete their overs without a recognised batter. Dwarshuis comes around the wicket and angles the ball across Bavuma who drags it back onto his stumps. 45th over: South Africa 264-5 (Bavuma 64, Mulder 17) Wiaan Mulder hammers a square drive off one knee all the way to the rope. That was as much class and timing as it was power, and one of the shots of the day. South Africa use the gaps well to make it a low-risk but reasonable-reward over. 44th over: South Africa 253-5 (Bavuma 58, Mulder 12) Wiaan Mulder finds a much-needed boundary with a clever late cut that races away to the boundary. Another four from a pull shot makes this South Africa’s best over for a long stretch. It has been a slow burn but 300 could still be on the cards. 43rd over: South Africa 242-5 (Bavuma 53, Mulder 6) A stoic knock from Temba Bavuma hasn’t been one to set the hearts racing but the South Africa skipper deserves credit for guiding the innings as he reaches a half-century. A sweep picks up two runs to take him past fifty off 64 balls. 42nd over: South Africa 236-5 (Bavuma 49, Mulder 4) Nathan Ellis is back on and so are the South African struggles with lifting the run rate. The visitors are suddenly looking short on wickets but four singles are not quite what is needed at this late stage. Dewald Brevis finally gets his shot in his ODI and quickly learns that if you live by the sword you can die by the sword. The South African rising star sends his first ball over Travis Head and well and truly over the rope. But his second shot doesn’t have enough on it against a stiff breeze and Alex Carey takes the catch just inside the long-on boundary. That was certainly entertaining. But not sure that was worth the wait. 41st over: South Africa 232-5 (Bavuma 47, Mulder 2) Tristan Stubbs is straight on the attack as he steps back to give himself room but mis-times a loft that flies straight to Cameron Green at long-off. 40th over: South Africa 223-3 (Bavuma 46, Stubbs 0) Adam Zampa is back on as the bowling changes keep South Africa on their toes. Some lazy running between wickets almost leads to a dismissal, before the leg-spinner strikes to send Matthew Breetzke on his way. Matthew Breetzke is done with waiting and seeks to lift the run rate. But the right-hander gets too far under a slog sweep and a top edge sails high to Aaron Hardie in the deep. Tristan Stubbs comes out while Australia perhaps won’t mind South Africa’s big-hitting star of the T20 series Dewald Brevis being left to bide his time. 39th over: South Africa 216-2 (Bavuma 45, Breetzke 51) Matthew Breetzke looks the more likely to get South Africa’s innings rocking and the right-hander raises his bat for the third time in as many internationals in the format. The 26-year-old now has two fifties and a ton from his three ODIs with time on his side to reach triple figures again. This half-century comes with a glance off Hazlewood to the rope. Bavuma adds another boundary with one of the shots of the day as he steps back and gets under a smash over cover. 38th over: South Africa 206-2 (Bavuma 40, Breetzke 46) Australia’s bowlers are on top as their variety in pace, line and length leaves the South Africa batters struggling to get them away. Temba Bavuma in particular seems to be eating up the deliveries with his 40 coming from 56 balls while the real firepower sits idle in the sheds. 37th over: South Africa 202-2 (Bavuma 39, Breetzke 43) It doesn’t get any easier for the South Africa duo as Josh Hazlewood returns. Breetzke finds a boundary with a loft over mid-off that might not have been timed perfectly but still reaches the rope along a dry outfield. Hazlewood has gone for 26 runs off seven overs so far. 36th over: South Africa 195-2 (Bavuma 37, Breetzke 39) Nathan Ellis brings out all his tricks as the South Africa pair seem to be trying to lift the run rate but have trouble getting the quick away. The visitors have plenty of fireworks in the sheds but are running out of overs to let them do their full damage. 35th over: South Africa 191-2 (Bavuma 36, Breetzke 38) Aaron Hardie is recalled for his second over after going for 13 runs off his first much earlier in the innings. And the South Africans seem intent on targeting the medium-pacer again with Bavuma leading the way. The skipper steps down the pitch to loft Hardie over cover to the rope before the Australian responds with a quicker ball that almost finds a way through. A word here and there suggests a nice little battle could be brewing between the pair. 34th over: South Africa 184-2 (Bavuma 31, Breetzke 36) Matthew Breetzke is moving now. Nathan Ellis mixes up his pace and length but the South African quickly picks up a shorter ball to casually square drive it to the rope. That’s drinks with this game evenly poised. 33rd over: South Africa 179-2 (Bavuma 31, Breetzke 31) Matthew Breetzke targets Labuschagne and dispatches the part-timer for much-needed back-to-back boundaries. A full toss firstly gets what it deserves as Breetzke sends it square to the rope but the next almost leads to his dismissal as the ball is hit high and over Alex Carey at deep midwicket. The Test keeper seems to lose the ball in the sun but might not have picked up the flight early enough. 32nd over: South Africa 169-2 (Bavuma 30, Breetzke 22) Zampa has clamped down on the South Africa skipper but Bavuma finally finds a boundary with a sweep that beats Hazlewood at backward square. 31st over: South Africa 164-2 (Bavuma 25, Breetzke 22) Marnus Labuschagne takes the ball for the first time today as spin continues to contain the flow of runs. Four singles are all that South Africa can find off the part-timer as the overs now feel like they are ticking away. 30th over: South Africa 160-2 (Bavuma 23, Breetzke 20) Fast glovework from Josh Inglis might have caught Temba Bavuma out of his crease as the review is sent upstairs. The South Africa skipper was out of his crease but has just managed to get his trailed foot back in time. 29th over: South Africa 155-2 (Bavuma 20, Breetzke 18) Travis Head returns but a sublime cover drive from Matthew Breetzke races away to the boundary as South Africa begin to build another strong partnership. 28th over: South Africa 149-2 (Bavuma 19, Breetzke 13) SIX! Breetzke takes a step down the crease and clobbers Dwarshuis toward a vacant long-on and beyond the rope. That was sweetly timed and just what South Africa needed. Bavuma joins in with a pull shot but his timing is off a little and the skipper has to settle for two. 27th over: South Africa 139-2 (Bavuma 16, Breetzke 6) A trademark Josh Hazlewood over limits South Africa to another three singles. A pull shot from each batter is the closest they come to testing the Australia quick’s length. 26th over: South Africa 136-2 (Bavuma 15, Breetzke 4) Ben Dwarshuis sends down another tidy six deliveries as the South Africa batters keep searching for singles but can only add three. 25th over: South Africa 133-2 (Bavuma 14, Breetzke 2) Josh Hazlewood comes back into the attack as Australia look to turn the screws. Breetzke takes time to pick up the line before finding a single to mid-off. 24th over: South Africa 132-2 (Bavuma 14, Breetzke 1) Ben Dwarshuis gets the breakthrough that Australia needed but it’s not enough to bring Dewald Brevis to the crease as Matthew Breetzke joins the skipper in his third ODI. Aiden Markram gives up much of his hard work as he feathers a dab to Josh Inglis behind the stumps. The South Africa opener is on his way for a classy 82 off 81 balls with nine boundaries, though he will rue not making a bigger score after looking so composed. 23rd over: South Africa 130-1 (Markram 82, Bavuma 13) Zampa screams for a catch as the ball flies off the toe of Markram’s bat before falling safely over midwicket. That’s the closest Australia have come to a second wicket for some time as the alarm bells start ringing. 22nd over: South Africa 124-1 (Markram 78, Bavuma 11) Mitch Marsh keeps ringing the changes as Australia get increasingly desperate for a breakthrough. Ben Dwarshuis comes back for his second spell after going for 16 runs from his first three overs. South Africa keep picking up the singles with another five off Dwarshuis. 21st over: South Africa 119-1 (Markram 75, Bavuma 9) Adam Zampa comes back into the attack as Australia need to not only restrict the run rate but perhaps even find a couple of wickets. Both batters work their way around the crease to work with the spin and ease to five singles. 20th over: South Africa 114-1 (Markram 72, Bavuma 7) Temba Bavuma is yet to really find his timing but puts any concerns aside as he pulls Nathan Ellis over midwicket for his first boundary. The South Africa batters pick out the gaps from there for another five singles. 19th over: South Africa 106-1 (Markram 70, Bavuma 1) Markram hammers Head with a cover drive that gets airborne but is never in any danger as it bounces toward the boundary. The opener finds another four when guiding the ball to third man and is now putting together a fine knock without his usual big-hitting fanfare. 18th over: South Africa 95-1 (Markram 60, Bavuma 1) Nathan Ellis takes over from Adam Zampa who has bowled three overs for 15 runs while troubling the South Africa openers. Bavuma is keen to get off the mark after a punch to mid-on. 17th over: South Africa 92-1 (Markram 58, Bavuma 0) South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma joins Aiden Markram at the crease with their side perhaps getting ready for take off. But the Australia spinners are proving hard to get away and Bavuma will likely to take to get his eye in while Markram keeps the score ticking over. Australia finally get a breakthrough as Ryan Rickelton steps down the track but can only loft his drive to Marnus Labuschagne at mid-off. The opener had not looked comfortable against the spinners but he has helped set up South Africa for some fireworks through the next two-thirds of the innings. 16th over: South Africa 85-0 (Markram 51, Rickelton 33) Aiden Markram passes 50 for the 16th time in 78 ODIs with a lofted drive over cover. Labuschagne saves the boundary with a dive near the rope but the three runs are enough for the opener’s half-century from 54 balls with six fours. 15th over: South Africa 80-0 (Markram 47, Rickelton 32) Rickelton gets another life! A thick outside edge is too sharp for Josh Inglis behind the stumps as the nick takes the ball away from the keeper’s gloves. 14th over: South Africa 76-0 (Markram 45, Rickelton 30) Australia loses a review after Zampa has Rickelton swinging wildly and hits him on the pads. That might have been out by the ball pitched just outside leg stump to the left-hander, who looks in all sorts against the Australian spinners. 13th over: South Africa 71-0 (Markram 42, Rickelton 28) Head drops one right on the spot as the ball drifts into, and then spins away from, Rickelton. The left-hander misses the attempted sweep and the finger goes up, but the review shows the ball bounced narrowly over middle stump. Rickelton looks unsure how to handle Head until deciding the best form of defence is to attack. The South African opener dances down the deck and lofts the ball back over Head and only narrowly beyond deep mid-on. 12th over: South Africa 67-0 (Markram 41, Rickelton 25) It’s spin from both ends as Adam Zampa is also called into the attack. The Australia leg-spinner doesn’t even bother to hide his displeasure at a misfield from Mitch Marsh at point costs him two runs. The South Africans are left working the gaps for a few singles. 11th over: South Africa 62-0 (Markram 37, Rickelton 24) With the powerplay complete Mitch Marsh immediately turns to spin as Travis Head takes the ball and begins around the wicket. Markram sits back and cuts hard to beat the fielder at deep point in an otherwise tidy over. 10th over: South Africa 56-0 (Markram 32, Rickelton 23) Nathan Ellis turns the screws with a tighter over and almost sends Rickelton on his way with a slower ball after the opener gets a thick inside edge on a square drive but somehow misses his stumps. Both sides might be happy with the powerplay as Australia restrict South Africa to only eight boundaries but the visitors have their full set of wickets in hand. 9th over: South Africa 54-0 (Markram 31, Rickelton 22) Aaron Hardie takes over from Josh Hazlewood who could hardly have been more impressive while going wicketless. Markram sends a loosener past the fielder at deep point, before Rickelton adds another boundary with a glance off the hip. South Africa might have taken their time to get the run rate moving, but they will be pleased to have seen off Australia’s new ball bowlers with all 10 wickets still in hand. 8th over: South Africa 41-0 (Markram 25, Rickelton 15) Nathan Ellis comes into the attack as Mitch Marsh makes his first move. Markram greets the Australia quick with a sublime straight drive that races away to the boundary. Rickelton adds another four with a well-time square drive through point. South Africa needed an over like that. 7th over: South Africa 32-0 (Markram 20, Rickelton 11) Alex Carey is at it again as the Test keeper chases down a Rickelton square drive just inside the rope to save a run. Markram looks to get the score moving – finally – with a pull over midwicket but the ball goes as high as it does long and barely moves after it crashes to the turf just short of the boundary. 6th over: South Africa 25-0 (Markram 16, Rickelton 8) Alex Carey is called back into action in the field as Ryan Rickelton takes off for a risky single that very nearly costs the opener his wicket. The ball bounces to Carey’s left and the time it takes him to get around it to pick up with his right and get a throw away is enough to pile on the pressure as the ball sails narrowly wide. Rickelton would have been out with a direct hit. 5th over: South Africa 20-0 (Markram 11, Rickelton 8) Alex Carey scampers across the outfield unusually without the wicketkeeping gloves and pads as Josh Inglis lines up behind the stumps. The Australian chases down a drive from Rickelton inside the rope and drops the ball neatly over the stumps as if to prove he can do it all. The South Africa openers still don’t look comfortable against Hazlewood but will be happy to pick up four runs from the over. 4th over: South Africa 16-0 (Markram 10, Rickelton 5) A tighter line from Ben Dwarshuis has Aiden Markram playing with caution until the final delivery when the South African punishes a wider ball with a square drive to the boundary. 3rd over: South Africa 11-0 (Markram 6, Rickelton 5) Aiden Markram finally opens up as he caresses a square drive across a lightning quick outfield to send the ball crashing into the rope. The South Africa opener repeats the stroke with a touch more power but it bounces straight to point. 2nd over: South Africa 6-0 (Markram 1, Rickelton 5) Ben Dwarshuis takes the new ball in his first ODI on home soil and the South Africa openers find the drop in pace easier to get away. Ryan Rickelton opens the scoring with a thick edge before Aiden Markram gets off the mark with a single to mid-off. The first contender for shot of the day goes to Rickelton as he uses the swing away from him to hammer a cover drive to the rope. 1st over: South Africa 0-0 (Markram 0, Rickelton 0) Josh Hazlewood does what he does best and immediately locks into a perfect line and length against Aiden Markram. The Australian metronome begins with a top-quality first over. That’s a maiden. Josh Hazlewood is at the top of his mark with Aiden Markram on strike. Here we go … The wind is blowing hard across Cazalys Stadium which should please Australia’s quicks including Josh Hazlewood, Ben Dwarshuis and Nathan Ellis who each impressed in the T20 series. Openers Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton are also heading to the crease with the former especially in need of runs after scoring only 31 in three knocks while leading South Africa in the T20 series. Australia will play this ODI in the shadow of former captain and coach Bob Simpson who was critical to turning the side’s fortunes around alongside Allan Border after a lean patch through the 1980s. Simpson died aged 89 after also playing 62 Tests for Australia over more than two decades. Mike Selvey has written in depth about one of the greats of Australian cricket. Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Temba Bavuma (c), Matthew Breetzke, Tristan Stubbs, Dewald Brevis, Wiaan Mulder, Keshav Maharaj, Prenelan Subrayen, Nandre Burger, Lungi Ngidi. Dewald Brevis is named for his ODI debut with Prenelan Subrayen also playing his first 50-over international as South Africa go with two spinners. Mitch Marsh (c), Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Cameron Green, Josh Inglis (wk), Alex Carey, Aaron Hardie, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood. Marnus Labuschagne returns to the lineup hoping that white-ball runs might press his claims for a place in the Ashes squad, while Alex Carey comes in as a specialist batter. South Africa captain Temba Bavuma calls “heads” but tails comes up. Mitch Marsh has a huge call to make but for the 21st time as Australia captain he says, “just thought I’d change it up and say that we’ll have a bowl first”. The Australia captain explains that the decision is based on more than just habit. “The wicket looks a touch drier than the other night but we saw that the dew plays a part so that’s the main reason why,” Marsh adds. Bavuma admits that he would have liked to bat first, but is happier to announce that Dewald Brevis will make his ODI debut. “He’s the star of the show at the moment, it would be nice if he could carry on with his heroics in the ODI format,” the Proteas skipper says. Dewald Brevis is expected to make his ODI debut for South Africa today - after smashing 125 not out and 53 in the last couple of T20s against Australia. The Proteas could do with Brevis’s power hitting after their bowling stocks suffered a huge blow when Kagiso Rabada was ruled out of the ODI series. The toss will be coming up in about five minutes – but it seems we can easily predict which way it will go if Mitch Marsh gets to decide whether Australia will bat or bowl first. Australia’s middle-order maverick Tim David and South Africa’s rising star Dewald Brevis lit up the T20s in Darwin, but it was left to a more familiar name in Glenn Maxwell to steer the hosts home with one ball to spare in the decider held in Cairns. Hello and welcome to live coverage of the first one-day international between Australia and South Africa at Cazalys Stadium. The focus turns to three matches in the 50-over format after a gripping T20 series over the past couple of weeks that included some powerful hitting in Darwin then went into a decider held in Cairns. Glenn Maxwell was the hero with the bat as Australia clinched a T20 series victory last Saturday night, though the white-ball great will be missing from this group of games after retiring from ODIs with the next World Cup still two years away. There are a number of other changes to each squad as the teams give opportunities to fresh talent and aim to find the right mix and formula for the longer term. Australia’s designated ODI captain Pat Cummins is unavailable with Mitch Marsh again set to take the reins, while Temba Bavuma will lead South Africa just as he did when the sides met in the World Test Championship final a couple of months ago. The teams should be more familiar with the conditions in Cairns after playing at the same venue three days ago, while they will head to Mackay for the remaining two games in the ODI series to be played on Friday and Sunday. The forecast is for sunny skies all afternoon and a high of 25C before it barely cools for the second stanza. First ball will be at 2.30pm local time / AEST. The toss and team news will be coming up shortly. Meanwhile, let us know your thoughts and predictions – shoot me an email or find me @martinpegan on Bluesky or X. Let’s get into it!
