  At last a Labour government has found itself a wealth tax – or thinks it has.
  Its proposed adjustment to council tax in England is crude and possibly cruel,
  and does nothing to help with Rachel Reeves’s “missing £40bn”. It is designed
  merely to shift money from rich regions to poor ones, and thus correct an
  imbalance in Britain’s regional wealth. As such it is overdue and welcome.
  British budgetary policy used to be classy. It was top hats and secrets and
  standing room only in parliament. Now it comprises a scruffy marathon of
  leaks, squeaks and denials. Lobbies form, rebels threaten and ministers pledge
  and unpledge. The local government secretary, Angela Rayner, has sought advice
  on a scheme to adjust the regional burden of council tax, unreformed since it
  replaced poll tax in 1993. The change is aimed at correcting its most severe
  defect: that poor people pay more in tax than in fairness they should, and
  rich people pay less. Government grants do not compensate councils
  accordingly. Thus at its crudest, the system means that a band H property in
  Hartlepool, County Durham, pays £3,000 a year more in council tax than a
  multimillion-pound townhouse in Westminster. On my own two-bedroom house in
  Wales, the basic council tax is £3,862. On my London house, many times its
  value, the tax going to the local borough is half that, just £1,850. Ever
  since this tax was introduced 30 years ago no government minister has dared
  order a national revaluation of properties, despite wild leaps in house
  prices. Nor has there been any widening of tax bands. A revaluation due in
  2005 was ditched by the then local government secretary, David Miliband, who
  admitted it was done out of sheer fear. Keir Starmer has no excuse for letting
  this continue. He has a big majority. Local government finance is in chaos.
  Many councils face bankruptcy. Services are closing everywhere, especially
  discretionary ones such as youth clubs, childcare and museums. He is clearly
  minded to do something, but he appears terrified of radicalism. He simply
  wants to tilt central grants more towards poorer councils at the expense of
  rich ones, and leave the system the same. A study of the plan by the Institute
  for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests some bizarre consequences. The central
  government grant to local councils is to be reallocated through a morass of
  algorithms assessing local needs. Central grants would be slashed for 186
  councils and increased for 161. Thirty councils would see their grants cut by
  more than 10% in the next three years, and some inner London boroughs by as
  much as 25%. The maths is beyond comprehension. The south-east does badly,
  which is to be expected. Yorkshire, Manchester and, for some reason, the East
  Midlands do well. Norwich, Crawley and indeed Enfield and Hillingdon also fare
  well. Suffolk and Leicestershire are losers, while Slough and Harlow are
  winners. Indeed, the more you look down the list, the more you wonder how
  officials worked it out, beavering away in their Whitehall attic. It seems
  suspiciously tilted to areas gained by Reform UK. The change would go some way
  to meeting Boris Johnson’s bid to “level up” regional Britain, though he did
  little levelling himself beyond inventing the phrase. He rightly drew
  attention to the fact that the UK’s disparity in disposable income between
  rich and poor, south and north, is now statistically wider than that of any
  country in the EU. Regional poverty impedes productivity, investment and
  national growth. As for council tax, even when he was mayor of London, Johnson
  protested at the gap between what “a Russian oligarch is paying on his
  stuccoed schloss in Kensington” and “what such a gentleman might be asked to
  pay in Paris or New York”. At least if the oligarch had a second home in
  Cornwall or Wales, he might now be hit with a council tax surcharge that could
  reach up to £10,000 a year. In other words, Starmer and Rayner may be hoping
  to reverse some of the disparity between councils in rich and poor parts of
  the country. They will hardly be reversing it between rich and poor
  individuals. Taxpayers in rich areas may see their bills rise steeply, perhaps
  even by more than the normal limit of 5%. But that is the nearest this reform
  gets to a mansion tax. What Rayner appears to lack the guts to do is tackle
  the central unfairness built into the council tax. The time is surely overdue
  to revise the wildly out-of-date valuations of taxable properties, and the
  wildly limited range of bands by which the tax is assessed. It is absurd for
  the richest houses to be charged just three times the poorest. A two-bedroom
  flat should not be paying only a third of what a sumptuous palace pays. A
  clear basis for revaluation is outlined by the IFS. It should be adopted. The
  government is tinkering with a broken wheel. It is gesturing in the direction
  of levelling up, but merely by reforming a centralist device – a grant. It
  should dare to be leftwing and go for the jugular. Houses should be taxed for
  their proper value. If you cannot call it a mansion tax, call it what it is: a
  property tax. But make sure it’s a proper one. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian
