  A huge wildfire tearing through California’s Los Padres national forest is
  threatening hundreds of homes and structures, after injuring at least three
  people in the days before. The Gifford fire has already scorched nearly 84,000
  acres (34,000 hectares) in coastal Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties,
  north of Los Angeles, and was still burning out of control on Tuesday evening,
  according to fire officials. It is 9% contained. It is now the largest fire in
  California this year so far, overtaking the Madre fire, which burned 80,779
  acres last month, also in San Luis Obispo county. A motorist was hospitalized
  with burn injuries after getting out of his vehicle and being overrun by
  flames, said Flemming Bertelsen, a spokesperson for the US Forest Service. Two
  contract employees assisting firefighters were also hurt when their
  all-terrain vehicle overturned. The blaze is threatening more than 800
  structures and has forced the closure of the highway in both directions east
  of Santa Maria, a city of about 110,000 people in Santa Barbara county.
  Evacuation orders were in effect in parts of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara
  counties. Ranchers evacuated cattle as aircraft made water drops on the
  encroaching flames. The blaze grew out of at least four smaller fires that
  erupted on Friday along State Route 166 between Santa Maria and Bakersfield.
  “That gave us multiple fronts, and the flames started fanning out in many
  directions,” Bertelsen said. “The fire is gobbling up chaparral and brushland
  and running up very steep slopes.” More than 1,900 personnel are battling the
  blaze. Firefighters made great progress on the west, north and east flanks of
  the fire and significant efforts were made to ensure structure protection on
  the south end, officials said in an update on Monday evening. Officials said
  they expected more helicopters to be able to deliver significant water drops
  on Tuesday with a drone doing reconnaissance. But officials cautioned
  dangerous conditions were ahead. A warming and drying trend was expected from
  Wednesday through the weekend, with temperatures up to 90F to 100F (32C to
  38C) on Thursday and Friday. The drought and heat were expected to increase
  fire behavior, officials said. The National Weather Service’s Los Angeles
  office has warned that the fire is generating considerable smoke, with smoke
  expected to move toward the south and east. A large smoke column formed as the
  blaze burned through steep terrain, Capt Scott Safechuck, a spokesperson with
  the Santa Barbara county fire department, told the Associated Press: “A lot of
  it’s in really inaccessible areas where even bulldozers can’t even get into.”
  The causes of the fire are under investigation.
