  The Charity Commission has criticised Prince Harry for allowing a row with the
  chair of his African charity to “play out publicly”, as the watchdog cleared
  him of racism. The prince was engaged in a public war of words earlier this
  year with the chair of the Sentebale charity, Dr Sophie Chandauka, after his
  resignation as a patron. Harry and the co-founder, Prince Seeiso of Lesotho,
  stepped down in March and its trustees quit over a dispute with Chandauka, a
  lawyer appointed in 2023. After Harry’s resignation was made public, Chandauka
  said she had been subjected to people who “play the victim card”. She had said
  that it was a “story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of
  poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying,
  harassment, misogyny, misogynoir [discrimination against black women] – and
  the cover-up that ensued”. In a ruling on Tuesday in a compliance case into
  Sentebale, which works with children and young people in southern Africa, the
  regulator criticised all those involved in the dispute for “allowing it to
  play out publicly”. It said the then trustees’ failure to resolve disputes
  internally had “severely impacted the charity’s reputation and risked
  undermining public trust in charities more generally”. David Holdsworth, the
  chief executive of the Charity Commission, said: “Sentebale’s problems played
  out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity’s
  reputation, risk[ing] overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising
  the charity’s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to
  serve. “This case highlights what can happen when there are gaps in governance
  and policies critical to charities’ ability to deliver for their cause. As a
  result, we have issued the charity a Regulatory Action Plan to make needed
  improvements and rectify findings of mismanagement.” In response to the
  report, a spokesperson for Harry, who was not a trustee and established the
  charity in memory of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, criticised the
  commission, claiming its report had fallen “troublingly short”. The commission
  found that a serious dispute between Chandauka and Harry had followed the
  formulation of a new fundraising strategy in the US. The breakdown in the
  relationship had been raised with the commission in February but an
  investigation was only opened in April after an analysis. The commission did
  not find evidence of widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including
  misogyny or misogynoir, it said, but acknowledged “the strong perception of
  ill treatment felt by a number of parties to the dispute and the impact this
  may have had on them personally”. It further found no evidence of “‘overreach’
  by either the chair or the Duke of Sussex as patron” but the commission was
  “critical of the charity’s lack of clarity in delegations to the chair which
  allowed for misunderstandings to occur”. It said: “The commission’s assessment
  of the various accounts that have been provided is that all the charity’s then
  trustees contributed to a missed opportunity to resolve issues which led to
  the dispute. “The regulator observed that strategic and financial difficulties
  that had emerged for the charity following the Covid-19 pandemic contributed
  to the tensions that arose.” A spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said:
  “Unsurprisingly, the commission makes no findings of wrongdoing in relation to
  Sentebale’s co-founder and former patron, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. “They
  also found no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny and
  misogynoir at the charity, as falsely claimed by the current chair. “Despite
  all that, their report falls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the
  fact that the consequences of the current chair’s actions will not be borne by
  her – but by the children who rely on Sentebale’s support. “Sentebale has been
  a deeply personal and transformative mission for Prince Harry, established to
  serve some of the most vulnerable children in Lesotho and Botswana.” A
  spokesperson for Sentebale said they were pleased with the action plan offered
  by the commission, which would allow it to “move forward … free from
  interference”. Chandauka said: “The unexpected adverse media campaign that was
  launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage
  and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviours displayed in private. “We
  are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger: more focused,
  better governed, boldly ambitious and with our dignity intact. “Despite the
  recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our founders,
  Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who established Sentebale in memory of their
  precious mothers, Princess Diana and Queen ‘Mamohato.”
