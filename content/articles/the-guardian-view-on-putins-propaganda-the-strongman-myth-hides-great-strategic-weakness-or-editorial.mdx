  The Guardian view on Putin’s propaganda: the strongman myth hides great
  strategic weakness | Editorial

  For a quarter of a century, Russian media have cultivated a myth of Vladimir
  Putin’s inspired leadership. State propaganda allows no hint of presidential
  fallibility. When things go wrong, official news ignores the setbacks. When
  problems cannot be downplayed, Mr Putin is portrayed as the wise corrector of
  errors made by underlings. Foreign perceptions of Mr Putin have been shaped by
  this image. It has been boosted online by Kremlin influence operations and
  embraced by nationalist politicians who admire the Russian president’s methods
  of domestic control and contempt for the rule of law. Until recently, Donald
  Trump was the most powerful figure in that category. The US president is no
  convert to democratic pluralism but he has become notably more suspicious of
  Russia and less effusive in his admiration for its president. He has
  threatened Moscow with tightened sanctions if there is not progress towards a
  ceasefire in Ukraine by the end of this week. Steve Witkoff, the White House
  special envoy, met Mr Putin on Wednesday for talks. The substance of the
  discussion was unclear. Uncertainty also shrouds the reasons for Mr Trump’s
  shifting stance and its durability. June’s Nato summit appears to have been
  critical in nudging the president towards greater appreciation of the alliance
  and scepticism about Mr Putin’s claims to want peace. The presidential ego is
  also a factor. Mr Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the Ukraine war and
  imagined it could be done swiftly. His initial method was to sideline and
  bully Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s president, while offering sweeping
  territorial concessions to Russia. That was a disgraceful betrayal of an
  embattled democracy and a reward for unprovoked military aggression. It was a
  gift for the Russian president. Yet Mr Putin was not satisfied and instead
  intensified the onslaught. Mr Trump has no record of sympathy with Ukraine’s
  plight, but he is notoriously sensitive to a snub. Mr Putin embarrassed him by
  refusing to do a quick deal. The Russian president’s motives are also obscure.
  He may be betting on the US staying keen to secure a ceasefire on a
  land-for-peace basis, and so grabbing more land before White House patience
  runs out altogether. But he is also trapped by his own maximalist demands. He
  has sent hundreds of thousands of young Russians to their deaths on the
  grounds that the nation is locked in an existential struggle with the west. He
  has cast Ukraine as a rogue province to be reintegrated into the greater
  Russian motherland. He has geared the country’s economy for perpetual war. His
  image as a great military leader is in jeopardy if Mr Zelenskyy is still the
  president of a viable sovereign country when the guns fall silent. There seems
  no brilliant plan behind Mr Putin’s determination to continue a brutal war of
  attrition. He does it through inertia and paranoia. He appears afraid to end
  the fighting on terms that risk ordinary Russians fully grasping the horrific
  pointlessness of the whole bloody business. History will surely record Mr
  Putin’s conduct in Ukraine as the action of a delusional murderer. The myth of
  the Russian president as some kind of mastermind is just another weapon of
  propaganda. Its function is to project strength where there is weakness, and
  make victory seem inevitable when the facts of the war describe a litany of
  Kremlin failure. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
