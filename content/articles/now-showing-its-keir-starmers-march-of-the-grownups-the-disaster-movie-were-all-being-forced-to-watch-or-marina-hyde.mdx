  “If I hear one more of our people saying that deckchairs are being shuffled on
  the Titanic,” a government supporter of Keir Starmer confided to the Daily
  Mail, “I will scream.” No need for shrieks. The prime minister’s No 10 hokey
  cokey on Monday wasn’t so much shuffling the deckchairs as restructuring the
  deck crew and announcing that some fresh faces will enable the team to work
  with new focus towards their ultimate goal of reshuffling. Expect the first
  strategy whiteboard to be broken out 370 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.
  For now, hold on to your aperitifs and continue to dress for dinner, because
  the erstwhile chief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, becomes something
  called chief secretary to the prime minister. To Starmer, Darren is a Mr
  Fixit; to many of his cabinet colleagues, he is a Mr Fuxit. That’s not the
  official line Downing Steet is going with, preferring instead to claim that
  yet another reset means Starmer is focused on “relentless delivery”. Delivery
  of what? They’ve barely passed any legislation. Hand on heart, meanwhile, I’m
  not sure the word “relentless” means what Starmer reckons it does. All he ever
  does is relent, on both staff and policy. The role of his comms chief, for
  example, is now essentially a gig economy job, while doing a monthly U-turn is
  the only thing he hasn’t U-turned on. We are watching a movie in which it’s
  not clear what the main character wants. Unsurprisingly, it has turned out to
  be box-office poison. But look, maybe it just needs a better tagline!
  Certainly, Monday found the Starmer administration toggling between new
  official and unofficial slogans. We have “delivering growth people can feel in
  their pockets”, which sounds suitably masturbatorial, and “just fucking do
  it”, which sounds suitably devoid of strategy. Both, however, are preferable
  to the way one member of Starmer’s inner circle characterised the latest
  reboot of the franchise, telling the Times that “this is about bringing the
  grownups in”. Oh no – not the dreaded grownups. Just as Batman reboots only
  ever promise to be even darker and even grittier, so Starmer reboots only ever
  promise to send for more grownups. Starmer has been claiming the grownups are
  coming since 2017. Doing it again now suggests he spent the first 14 months of
  government running an administration staffed by kids. Then again,
  non-cinematic inspiration was available. “We’re not pitching you a new Netflix
  series,” explained the then shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds in the
  run-up to last year’s general election. “We’re not putting on politics as
  entertainment.” Finally, a pledge on which the government has delivered.
  Unfortunately, as I suggested at the time, it would have been much better if
  the government had emulated Netflix in one crucial regard. When the streamer
  greenlights a series, it tends to know how much it is going to cost, and
  precisely how it will all be paid for. Keir Starmer’s government remains “on a
  journey” on that front, and it is this more than anything else that is going
  to do for him. Or, if you prefer, has already done for him. It was barely nine
  months ago that Rachel Reeves was defending last year’s budget to the CBI,
  declaring: “I’m really clear: I’m not coming back with more borrowing or more
  taxes. That is why at this budget, we did wipe the slate clean to put public
  finances and public services on a firm footing, and as a result, we won’t have
  to do a budget like this ever again.” Spoiler alert: they’re going to have to
  do a much worse one. Yes, in a development that was both clearly predictable
  and clearly predicted, the promise not to raise any of the three biggest taxes
  – but to give Britain a far better lifestyle than that to which it had become
  angrily accustomed – has not come off. In related news, Britain is now much
  angrier. And it’s going to be a whole lot angrier still come the budget.
  People will be quite within their rights to say they never voted for any of
  the things Reeves is going to have to do. It’s extremely difficult see how she
  survives that. During the last election campaign, Rishi Sunak’s claim that
  Labour would have to raise taxes was treated like some whopper for the ages,
  with Starmer calling it “absolute garbage” and hotly claiming that the then PM
  had broken the ministerial code by suggesting that a £2,000 tax hike per
  person across the parliament would be the way a Labour government would fill a
  £22bn hole. “He knew very well what he was doing,” sniffed Starmer. “He lied
  about our plans. And that is a true test of character. As we go to the polls
  it is important for voters to know about the character of the two individuals
  who want to be prime minister.” Well quite. And yet, it is genuinely difficult
  to suspend one’s disbelief enough to be able to believe that the current
  economic position can be a surprise to Starmer. He must have known that what
  he was promising in the run-up to the election – an election he was always
  going to win – didn’t add up. And if he didn’t, he and his chancellor are even
  more incompetent than they have so far come across. Their lofty promises
  amount to a form of populism almost as corrosive as the ones they say they
  disdain – indeed, it may end up the midwife to them. Evasions this big should
  simply be called lies. Unfortunately, every single political party’s manifesto
  majored on them last time round. During the Brexit years, the term cakeism was
  popularised to sum up the prevalent mood that everything could be acquired
  without cost. Boris Johnson famously announced that he was “pro having it and
  pro eating it” – yet despite seeing how that turned out for everyone from
  Theresa May to Johnson himself, Starmer and Reeves’s economic promises were
  cakeism of the first water. These days, so are Reform’s. Nigel Farage has
  already promised £80bn of new spending with no remotely serious suggestion as
  to how it will be funded. Mister Honest is lying to the British people, just
  like he did in the run-up to the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, and if
  he does make it into No 10, we will yet again see where kicking the can down
  the road gets us. Except perhaps by then, we will have run out of road.
  Someone, at some point, is going to have to approach a position of honesty
  with the public – but the appetite for self-delusion suggests the time where
  that would be a winning position is some way off. Until then, we will become
  ever more stuck – trapped in a never-ending episode of The Great British
  Cakeism-Off. Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist
