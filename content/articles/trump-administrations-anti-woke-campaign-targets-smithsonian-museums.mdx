  Amid the Donald Trump administration’s heavy-handed review of Smithsonian
  museums, the Guardian has seen a document compiled by the White House that
  details examples of how the administration believes widely visited cultural
  institutions have overly negative portrayals of US history. The document,
  based on public submissions shared with the administration, points to what it
  says are problematic exhibits at seven different museums, including a Benjamin
  Franklin exhibit that links his scientific achievements to his ownership of
  enslaved people and a film about George Floyd’s murder that it says
  mischaracterizes the police. “President Trump will explore all options and
  avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable,” a
  White House official said. “Until we get info from the Smithsonian in response
  to our letter, we can’t verify the numbers of artifacts that have been removed
  because the Smithsonian has removed them on their own.” Trump announced the
  initiative on Truth Social earlier this week, writing: “The Smithsonian is OUT
  OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad
  Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.” The seven
  museums that have so far been flagged for review include the National Museum
  of American History, the upcoming National Museum of the American Latino, the
  National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African Art, the
  National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the
  National Museum of Asian Art. The administration argues exhibits at these
  museums focus excessively on oppression rather than American achievements. At
  the National Museum of American History, the document flagged the ¡Presente!
  Latino history exhibition for allegedly promoting an “anti-American agenda” by
  examining colonization effects and depicting the US as stealing territory from
  Mexico in 1848. Examples from the document also shames the museum’s Benjamin
  Franklin exhibit for linking his scientific achievements to his ownership of
  enslaved people, and the Star-Spangled Banner display for focusing on American
  historical failures and controversies rather than celebrating national
  achievements. The National Portrait Gallery is being singled out for focusing
  on how the Chinese Exclusion Act and other racist immigration laws
  contradicted the Statue of Liberty’s welcoming message. The African art museum
  is targeted over the George Floyd film. And the Asian art museum is flagged
  for exhibitions for claiming to impose western gender ideology on traditional
  cultures. Last week, the White House budget director, Russ Vought, sent
  letters to eight museums demanding information about exhibits within 30 days
  and instructing officials to implement “content corrections” including
  replacing “divisive” language. The review follows similar Trump administration
  pressure on universities, which resulted in institutions paying hundreds of
  millions to the government and walking back diversity initiatives. Separately,
  the Smithsonian has already made changes to exhibits referencing Trump,
  removing all mention of his impeachments from a presidential power display at
  the American history museum in July, leaving only generic references to three
  presidents facing potential removal from office. The museum administrators
  clarified, however, that the removal was part of an update, and that the
  impeachment information was restored on 8 August. It’s unclear, however,
  exactly which museums are under review. A letter from the White House to the
  Smithsonian Institution secretary, Lonnie Bunch, last week included a
  different list of museums: the museums of American history, natural history,
  African American history and culture, and the American Indian, along with the
  National Air and Space Museum, the American Art Museum, the National Portrait
  Gallery, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, were all up for
  internal review. The Smithsonian Institution did not immediately respond to
  requests for comment, but the Guardian obtained a statement sent by Bunch, the
  14th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to colleagues. “The Smithsonian
  continues to appear in multiple news stories and social media posts, I have
  received questions and comments from many of you. The Smithsonian will always
  be shaped by scholarship and guided by our core values. While our collections
  may evolve to reflect new discoveries and insights, the intellectual honesty
  and the integrity of our research and collections will not change. Throughout
  our 179-year history, we have listened to and learned from our fellow
  citizens, as part of our mission to provide Americans with high-quality,
  factual content and world-class science. “While we cannot know what future
  critiques will hold, I do know that I have the greatest faith in your ability
  to persevere and effectively represent an institution whose goal is simply to
  help a nation better understand its past, produce and convey the most accurate
  science and scholarship, and serve the greater good.” David Smith contributed
