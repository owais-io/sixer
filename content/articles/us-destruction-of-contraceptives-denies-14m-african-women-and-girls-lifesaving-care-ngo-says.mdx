  A decision by the US government to incinerate more than $9.7m (£7.3m) of
  contraceptives is projected to result in 174,000 unintended pregnancies and
  56,000 unsafe abortions in five African countries. More than three-quarters of
  the contraceptives (77%) were destined for the Democratic Republic of the
  Congo, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia and Mali, according to the International
  Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), an NGO global healthcare provider and
  advocate of sexual and reproductive rights. The contraceptives, many of which
  will not expire until 2027-29, had already been manufactured, packaged and
  ready for distribution. IPPF offered to take them for redistribution at no
  cost to the US taxpayer, but the offer was declined. Their destruction will
  deny more than 1.4 million women and girls in the five countries access to
  lifesaving care, IPPF said. Marie Evelyne Petrus-Barry, the Africa regional
  director of IPPF, said: “This decision to destroy ready-to-use commodities is
  appalling and extremely wasteful. These lifesaving medical supplies were
  destined to countries where access to reproductive care is already limited,
  and in some cases, part of a broader humanitarian response, such as in the
  DRC. The choice to incinerate them is unjustifiable.” As a result of the
  decision, more than 1m injectable contraceptives and 365,100 implants will not
  be distributed in Tanzania, 28% of the total annual need in the country. Dr
  Bakari, a project coordinator at Umati, IPPF’s member association in Tanzania,
  said: “We are facing a major challenge. The impact of the USAID funding cuts
  has already significantly affected the provision of sexual and reproductive
  health services in Tanzania, leading to a shortage of contraceptive
  commodities, especially implants. This shortage has directly impacted clients’
  choices regarding family planning uptake.” In Mali, women will be denied
  access to 1.2m oral contraceptives and 95,800 implants, amounting to almost a
  quarter (24%) of the country’s annual need. In Zambia, women will go without
  48,400 implants and 295,000 injectable contraceptives, while in Kenya 108,000
  women will not have access to contraceptive implants. Nelly Munyasia, the
  executive director for the Reproductive Health Network in Kenya, said the
  impact of USAID cuts was already being felt in the country. Stockpiles of
  long-term contraceptives had already run out, she said, which will have
  drastic consequences on women’s health and their sexual and reproductive
  rights. Meanwhile, the skill set of health workers is being reduced and there
  is a 46% funding gap in Kenya’s national family planning programme. “These
  systemic setbacks come at a time when unmet need for contraception remains
  high,” she said. “Nearly one in five girls aged 15 to 19 are already pregnant
  or has given birth. Unsafe abortions remain among the five leading causes of
  maternal deaths in Kenya. While the Kenyan constitution, adopted in 2010,
  allows for abortion when a pregnant person’s life or health is at risk, the
  Kenyan penal code of 1963 still criminalises it. Healthcare providers are
  reluctant to provide safe care while the penal code remains in place, even in
  emergencies. Munyasia said without adequate supplies of contraceptives there
  would be a rise in maternal mortality as a result of women seeking to end
  unintended pregnancies. Last month, a US state department spokesperson
  confirmed that the decision to destroy the contraceptives had been made. Amid
  reports that the contraceptives were due to be incinerated in France, the
  French government said it was “following the situation closely” after
  feminist, rights and family planning groups expressed outrage at the proposal.
  The department decided to destroy the contraceptives because it could not sell
  them to any “eligible buyers”, in part because of US laws and rules that
  prohibit sending US aid to organisations that provide abortion services,
  counsel people about the procedure or advocate for the right to it overseas,
  according to the state department spokesperson.
