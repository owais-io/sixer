  Flights were briefly suspended at Manchester airport on Friday morning after
  two easyJet planes collided, clipping wings as they taxied to the runway for
  takeoff. The aircraft, which were flying to Paris and Gibraltar, came into
  contact at about 6.30am but were able to return to a stand where all the
  passengers disembarked. There are no reports of injuries. A spokesperson for
  Manchester airport said: “We suspended operations briefly while they were
  assessed to see if they could taxi back to a stand, which they could so
  operations resumed after a few minutes.” Tynisha Chaudhry, who was on the
  Gibraltar-bound flight with her partner, compared the collision to a car
  crash. “We felt the whole plane shudder – it was a massive hit,” she told the
  BBC. She said “a lot of fire engines” and other safety crews were at the scene
  as passengers waited onboard as inspections were carried out. EasyJet said an
  immediate investigation was launched to understand what happened. A
  spokesperson said: “EasyJet can confirm that the wing tips of two aircraft
  came into contact while taxiing to the runway at Manchester airport this
  morning. The aircraft returned to stand to disembark customers who have been
  provided with refreshment vouchers while replacement aircraft are arranged to
  operate the flights. “We apologise to customers for the delay to their
  flights. The safety of our passengers and crew is our highest priority.” The
  flights involved were EZY2267 from Manchester to Gibraltar and EZY2117 from
  Manchester to Paris Charles de Gaulle. Some passengers posted pictures of the
  incident on social media, with one noting: “Trip to Disney Paris has started
  well at #Manchesterairport #easyjet.” A Friday in the middle of August is a
  busy day for all UK airports but the live departure board at Manchester
  airport did not appear to show any wider delays caused by the incident.
