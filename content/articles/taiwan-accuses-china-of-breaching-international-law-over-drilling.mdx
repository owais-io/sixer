  Taiwan’s government has accused China of breaching international law by
  drilling for oil and gas inside Taiwan’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and
  immediately demanded it halt the activity. The statement from the office of
  Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, came after revelations first reported by the
  Guardian that several Chinese oil rigs and associated vessels had been
  detected inside Taiwan’s EEZ, near the disputed Pratas Islands, which are
  under Taiwanese control. A report published by the Jamestown Foundation, a
  US-based thinktank, said the assets had been there for up to five years, and
  were all owned by the Chinese state-run China National Offshore Oil
  Corporation (CNOOC). Their presence had not been previously reported. The
  Guardian independently confirmed the continued presence of most of them last
  week, using commercial civilian maritime tracking platforms. On Wednesday,
  Taiwan’s presidential office spokesperson, Karen Kuo, called for China to
  “clearly explain” its actions and “immediately cease illegal deployment and
  exploitation activities in the economic waters of countries in the region,
  including Taiwan”. “This not only violates international legal norms such as
  the United Nations convention on the law of the sea (Unclos), but also
  seriously undermines the international order and poses uncertain risks to
  regional stability,” she said. Kuo said Taiwan’s defence and security agencies
  were aware of the situation and were “conducting a comprehensive review of the
  patterns and risks of the related activity”. Experts told the Guardian that
  the activity fitted into Beijing’s pattern of using both military and
  commercial activity to gain control over disputed territory, particularly in
  the South China Sea and around Taiwan, which Beijing is preparing to annex as
  a Chinese province. That such activity had continued essentially in plain
  sight for five years, without a response from Taiwan, surprised analysts.
  “Failure to protest today risks normalising sovereignty shaving and encourages
  further encroachment,” the Jamestown report warned. But analysts also said
  Taiwan was very limited in what it could do about it. Taiwan’s political
  status means it is not party to the UN convention on the law of the sea or its
  arbitration mechanisms. Domestic law about which parts of the EEZ border are
  enforced by Taiwan is unclear and Taipei does not have the maritime strength
  to challenge such activity. William Yang, the senior north-east Asia analyst
  with the International Crisis Group, said Taiwan first needed to clarify which
  agency was responsible and then establish a set of diplomatic and law
  enforcement responses, including increased support for more coastguard
  patrols. “Without these initial steps, it will continue to struggle to
  effectively address these challenges,” Yang said. A spokesperson for Taiwan’s
  ministry of defence, Col Chiao Fu-chun, told the Guardian the ministry was
  aware of the vessels operating near the Pratas Islands – which Taiwan calls
  the Dongsha Islands – and could “assist our coastguard to respond when
  needed”. Kuo said Taiwan would “cooperate with relevant countries in the
  region” to seek joint responses. Last month Japan protested against similar
  activity by Chinese oil rigs inside its EEZ, and Vietnam and Korea have also
  made similar complaints in the past. Yang said: “If Taiwan can make a strong
  connection between these Chinese grey zone activities, it could encourage
  other countries with more diplomatic leverage and resources to incorporate the
  challenges that Taiwan is facing into their potential collective regional
  responses.”
