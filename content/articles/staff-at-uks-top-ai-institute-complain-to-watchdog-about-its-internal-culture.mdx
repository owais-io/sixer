  Staff at the UK’s leading artificial intelligence institute have raised
  concerns about the organisation’s governance and internal culture in a
  whistleblowing complaint to the charity watchdog. The Alan Turing Institute
  (ATI), a registered charity with substantial state funding, is under
  government pressure to overhaul its strategic focus and leadership after an
  intervention last month from the technology secretary, Peter Kyle. In a
  complaint to the Charity Commission, a group of current ATI staff raise eight
  points of concern and say the institute is in danger of collapse due to
  government threats over its funding. The complaint alleges that the board of
  trustees, chaired by the former Amazon UK boss Doug Gurr, has failed to fulfil
  core legal duties such as providing strategic direction and ensuring
  accountability, with staff alleging a letter of no confidence was delivered
  last year and not acted upon. A spokesperson for ATI said the Charity
  Commission had not been in touch with the institute about any complaints that
  may have been sent to the organisation. They added that a whistleblower
  complaint had been filed last year to the government’s UK Research and
  Innovation body, which funds ATI, and a subsequent independent investigation
  found no concerns. The complaint comes after ATI, which is undergoing a
  restructuring, notified about 50 staff – or approximately 10% of its workforce
  – that they were at risk of redundancy. It claims ATI’s funding is at risk,
  citing “privately raised concerns” from unnamed industry partners, while
  warning that Kyle has made clear that future government support is contingent
  on improved delivery and leadership change. In a letter to Gurr this month,
  Kyle called for a switch in focus to defence and national security at ATI, as
  well as leadership changes. While the letter stated ATI should “continue to
  receive the funding needed to implement reforms”, it said its “longer-term
  funding arrangement” could be reviewed next year. The complaint claims there
  has been no internal or external accountability for how ATI funds have been
  used. It alleges there is an internal culture of “fear, exclusion, and
  defensiveness”. It also alleges the board has not provided adequate oversight
  of a series of senior leadership departures under the chief executive, Jean
  Innes, nor of senior leadership appointments, and that ATI’s credibility with
  “staff, funders, partners, and the wider public has been significantly
  undermined”, as shown by the letter of no confidence and Kyle’s intervention.
  The Guardian has also learned that ATI is shutting projects related to online
  safety, tackling the housing crisis and reducing health inequality as part of
  its restructuring, which is resulting in the closure or mothballing of
  multiple strands of research. The restructuring has triggered internal
  upheaval at ATI, with more than 90 staff sending a letter to the board last
  year warning that cost cuts were putting the organisation’s reputation at
  risk. Among the projects slated for closure are work on developing AI systems
  to detect online harms, producing AI tools that can help policymakers tackle
  issues such as inequality and affordability in the housing market and
  measuring the impact in health inequality of major policy decisions like
  lockdowns. Other projects expected to close include an AI-based analysis of
  how the government and media interact. A project looking at social bias in AI
  outcomes will also be dropped. Projects being paused include a study into how
  AI might affect human rights and democracy, as well as research into creating
  a global approach to AI ethics. A spokesperson for ATI said: “We’re shaping a
  new phase for the Turing, and this requires substantial organisational change
  to ensure we deliver on the promise and unique role of the UK’s national
  institute for data science and AI. As we move forward, we’re focused on
  delivering real-world impact across society’s biggest challenges, including
  responding to the national need to double down on our work in defence,
  national security and sovereign capabilities.” A Charity Commission
  spokesperson said the organisation could not confirm or deny whether it had
  received a complaint, in order to protect the identity of any whistleblowers.
