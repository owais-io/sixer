  A sprawling mansion, full of look-at-me reality contestants trying to win
  money by playing a parlour game based on manipulation and persuasion? It’s
  either a new season of The Traitors, or a clone trying to steal some of The
  Traitors’ addictive, gossip-worthy magic. Welcome to The Inheritance, a clone
  that has clearly been carefully worked on, but which has still come out a bit
  wonky. Thirteen players – spanning the usual reality-TV spectrum of age and
  class, from a student/influencer and a debt-ridden scaffolder to a flawlessly
  styled socialite and a wily pensioner – convene at a country pile, the rich
  owner of which has supposedly died. The contestants are the would-be
  beneficiaries of the estate and are given a new group task each week. But,
  instead of this cash being added to a shared fund, the group must nominate one
  player to receive all of it. It’s fiendishly simple! Except that, no it isn’t
  because there are many, many conditions to apply. Players who think they
  deserve the money put themselves forward as a “claimant”, ie a candidate
  standing for election. The claimants are not in the room when the rest of the
  group – the “jury” – decide who wins. Then the winner can either keep all the
  money, or choose to gift some back to members of the group, divided in
  whichever way they wish – with the proviso that they cannot give money to
  other claimants. Being a claimant, therefore, means running the risk of ending
  the round with nothing. Which would be bad, because at some point, the player
  with the least money will be eliminated. Oh, and the weekly winner divvies up
  the money (or keeps it all) in secret, so they can lie about how much they
  bestowed on others. Although, when the poorest player is booted out,
  presumably this will enable players to deduce who lied about sharing their
  cash. If this sounds confusing, rest assured that when you watch The
  Inheritance for yourself, it is confusing. A flawed format is not a
  dealbreaker in this genre: after all, the aim of the game in The Traitors is
  meant to be voting out all the traitors, which can’t be allowed to happen
  because it would end the show, so swathes of that show’s early action have to
  be a sham. But The Inheritance is an overcomplicated hotch-potch, the obvious
  issue being that there are only likely to be one or two plausible candidates
  for the winner of each task, which leaves everyone else scrabbling for a
  purpose since there’s no weekly elimination. The players deal with this by
  reverting to their base reality-telly instincts. They build alliances, form
  cliques, then berate other people for forming cliques and building alliances
  and cry about being excluded. The main motivation for making friends is meant
  to be to ensure that if you don’t win a task, the person who does may decide
  to share some money with you. But, since you don’t know if they’ve actually
  done that, it’s all a bit hypothetical – and it’s hard to care who’s side
  anyone is on. In any case, the main showdown in each episode is about who
  should win the task, and that’s just a debate about observable reality: people
  make claims about their contribution, which others can dispute because they
  were there. There’s no equivalent to those delicious moments in The Traitors
  where players face instant death if they can’t deflect baseless conspiracy
  theories hurled at them by the mob. Nobody can brazenly bluff it. Players
  arguing about the tasks brings up another problem: we have to care about the
  tasks. You may even feel obliged to actually watch them, instead of skipping
  to the bit where everyone has a massive barney. But they’re pure reality slop,
  the tedious spectacle of fools failing at contrived projects – bottling wine
  in the opening instalment, herding farm animals in episode two – constantly
  interrupted by clips from contestants’ post-task interviews, where they
  chirpily tell us things we’ve just observed perfectly well ourselves.
  Overseeing all this are our hosts (plural, because it takes more than one
  person to try to replace the godlike Traitors presenter Claudia Winkleman).
  Officiating from moment to moment is Rob Rinder, who doesn’t have much to do
  beyond reading the rules off a sheet. He appears to be aiming for an air of
  sophisticated indifference, but just looks bored to death. The big hire is
  Elizabeth Hurley as the deceased stately homeowner, but even her camp video
  messages (“Hello, darlings! I’M DEAD!”) soon lose their lustre and become
  superfluous. The Inheritance could turn out to be playing a cunning long game,
  but there are enough reasons here to vote it off in week one. The Inheritance
  is on Channel 4 now
