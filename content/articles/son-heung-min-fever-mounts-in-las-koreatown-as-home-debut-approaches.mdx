  Sitting at the table at Baja’s Grill in Los Angeles’ Koreatown, Daniel Cho
  uses his stylus to add an outline to a new sticker. It’s two fingers in an L
  shape, framing a box with the No 7, a replication of Son Heung-min’s signature
  celebration. Nearby, fans are banging on drums, shouting “Ole ole ole ole,
  LAFC I love you. Wherever even in my dreams, I’ll follow you,” in a mixture of
  Korean and Spanish, a chant adapted from one belonging to fans of the Suwon
  Samsung Bluewings in the K-League, Korea’s top division. Growing up in
  Argentina, Cho was accustomed to soccer being the dominant focus. His friends
  all supported Boca Juniors. Cho emigrated to America at the age of 17 and
  settled in Koreatown, where Lionel Messi’s popularity piqued his interest. But
  it wasn’t until he met other Los Angeles Football Club fans at church that he
  grew to be a loyal, weekly watcher. Now, his Son Heung-min art will adorn the
  stands at BMO Field, LAFC’s home stadium where the former Tottenham Hotspur
  star will make his home debut this weekend. Son’s signing has broken many
  records: a league-record transfer fee that reportedly exceeds $26m and jersey
  sales that surpass the likes of LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo. It’s also
  brought a ripple effect into Koreatown, where the majority of Southern
  California’s 320,000 Korean Americans live. “I grew up in Argentina and I love
  Messi, but having Son represent at that kind of level is really humbling. It’s
  a really proud moment for us as Koreans,” Cho said. A moment long in the
  making In some ways, LAFC fans have been preparing for Son’s arrival for
  years. In 2018, Ben Chi got an invitation from LAFC club owners about a
  mysterious VIP guest. As a previous manager for merchandise at the club, Chi
  helped launch what was then known as a Korean supporter group, the Tigers.
  Although the group started as a dozen Korean American soccer fans, it quickly
  expanded to represent the full diversity of Koreatown residents. Disguised as
  a meeting with the executives of Riot Games, the gathering turned into a meet
  and greet with Son himself. “I just couldn’t keep it together,” Chi said of
  the meeting. Chi believes that LA itself is a big part of the reason why Son
  made his move, whether it’s due to fervent supporters, plenty of Korean
  heritage, or material comforts. “He spent a lot of time in Germany. He spent a
  lot of time in London. LA can give him a sense of home without actually being
  home,” Chi said. “He can continue his football journey without feeling like
  it’s coming to a close in Korea.” Son, of course, is more that just a
  phenomenal Asian soccer player, or one of the most famous Koreans alive. But
  there is no doubt that there is a surge in business interest related to his
  identity. LAFC have completely sold out Son’s primary black jersey online and
  at the BMO Stadium store, according to a club spokesperson. LAFC more than
  doubled their subscribers on YouTube, with 70% of the new audience joining
  from Korea. Son’s Tapping Glas” video, announcing his signing, gave the club’s
  TikTok over 12.5m views and more than 135,000 new followers. “Because he is
  Korean and there’s a lot of small and large Korean businesses, people want to
  attach their being or their entity with his likeness and with all the hype
  that’s surrounded by it right now,” said Jeremy Kim, a partner at M.Co coffee
  shop in Koreatown. While LAFC and Son have not announced any new LA-based
  sponsorships, Kim said that he has heard of “a lot of movement, a lot of
  talks” of different people showing up to the club’s offices for partnership
  meetings. “If you are a business that has millions in revenue a year, although
  you may not be named nationally, you are still trying to see if it’s possible
  to attach a bit to that.” Tourism agencies specializing in Korea-US travel are
  already seeing a spike in interest. “For us as a travel agency, this ‘Son
  Heung-min effect’ has opened up a new breakthrough, and we see it as a very
  meaningful opportunity,” said Pyoungsik Bahk, the president of US Aju Tour.
  Aju Tour has received more than 400 requests from interested tourists from
  Korea who want to see Son play and continues to sell special package tours for
  LAFC games in September and October. Not to be outdone, competitor Samho Tour
  is also developing add-ons for existing tour packages for Korean and Korean
  American out-of-state travelers, including adding LAFC home matches for West
  Coast sightseeing tours in LA and San Diego. Both agencies have had a hard
  time securing block seating because of the tenfold price increase. When Shohei
  Ohtani signed a $700m contract for 10 years with the Dodgers in 2023, his
  presence ushered in new Japanese tourism boom, with the number of tourists
  from the country doubling from 2023 to 2024, according to the LA tourism
  board. This year, Nikaido became the first Japanese shochu brand offered at
  Dodger Stadium. You can also now find Tsukiji Gindaco’s traditional takoyaki,
  or fried octopus balls at the concessions. In time, there may be a similar
  change or two at BMO Stadium as well. Intergenerational unity Su Jin Lee
  happened to be in Chicago for vacation when it became clear that Son would
  make his debut in nearby Bridgeview against the Chicago Fire. At the game, she
  said she saw a sea of Tottenham, national team, and custom Son shirts.
  “Eurosnobs said they would never watch an MLS game. All of sudden Son is here,
  and people are asking me about tickets. I’ve been preaching about this for
  seven years!” said Lee, who formerly served as a vice-president for the 3252,
  the independent supporters union for LAFC’s affiliated supporters groups and
  fans. It’s not the first time that LAFC has signed a Korean player. In 2021,
  the club signed right-back Kim Moon-hwan, who played for two seasons before he
  moved to the K-League. While Kim did bring a certain level of excitement,
  Son’s status as a global star is on another level entirely. David Dong, the
  owner of BiergartenLA, a German-Korean fusion gastropub in Koreatown, said
  that before the Chicago-LAFC match, his restaurant received a lot of calls
  from people interested in watching Son play. By half-time, the restaurant was
  full with a waitlist to get in. “The past two games, we’ve seen a lot more
  Koreans and we’ve seen families coming together. We see kids coming, we see
  parents coming. We are staffing up more than usual. We didn’t anticipate the
  reception to be this big,” Dong said. Lee has seen similar interest. “My mom
  works with older ladies at the Korean market and they’re all talking about it.
  They’re so hyped about this Korean man that they’re enamored with,” he said.
  Even the Harmonica Grannies, a group of Koreatown retirees who have played the
  US national anthem at NHL games, are excited about the prospect of playing in
  front of Son someday. Many of the retirees, born in the 1940s, still remember
  playing soccer at a young age in Korea. “Korea was very poor [when they grew
  up] and soccer was virtually the only sport, as one ball could bring together
  10 or 20 children to play. That is why the joy of scoring a goal is still
  remembered vividly throughout their bodies,” said Hyunok Lee, president of
  Koreatown Senior and Community Center. All say that in the case of Son, soccer
  provides a more intergenerational bond between family members than other
  recent Korean imports that have gained popularity in the States, like K-pop.
  “You have something to bond about, you have something to watch together,
  something that crosses those boundaries that would normally be there,” Jeremy
  Kim added. The ‘perfect bridge’ for a more unified LA Fernando Delgado
  remembers pulling up to a watch party at a local Koreatown radio station
  during the 2018 World Cup. Son had just scored a goal during the group stage
  match against Germany, effectively pushing the Germans out of World Cup
  contention and advancing Mexico into the knockout rounds. “It was insane. We
  just hear everybody shouting ‘Coreano, hermano, ya eres Mexicano [Korean,
  brother, you’re Mexican now],” Delgado said. “It was an honor, celebrating
  that win altogether.” Delgado now serves as co-president of the LAFC Tigers
  supporters group. For him, Son represents a humble leader who can empower the
  younger generation of players at the club. He described this while watching
  Son’s second match for LAFC, against the New England Revolution, and as he
  explained this dynamic, as if on cue, Son tapped the ball to his left,
  providing an assist for teammate Mathieu Choinière. “He’s not like the person
  boasting or trash-talking out of the field. He’s very respectful and
  demonstrates that respect and embodies it,” said Delgado. Lee hopes to see Son
  become the “perfect bridge” and “amazing ambassador” for the city, getting
  more involved in local charity initiatives since he is so universally loved as
  a global personality. Son has also been known for his involvement in
  philanthropic efforts, including donations for natural disasters and awareness
  campaigns related to homelessness. Recently, fans told the Guardian that they
  saw him in a video calling for more donations for food aid in Palestine on the
  UN World Food Programme social media as a Global Goodwill ambassador. “Soccer
  is all about community. All of the stuff we’ve been through the last year,
  it’s important to feel a sense of community,” Lee said. Kyeongjun Kim
