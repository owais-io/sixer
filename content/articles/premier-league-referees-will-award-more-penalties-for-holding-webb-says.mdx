  Howard Webb has warned fans they can expect to see more penalties this season
  after he instructed referees to have another go at cracking one of the most
  incorrigible problems in the Premier League: players clinging on to each other
  in the penalty area. New guidance on how to deal with holding has been shared
  with referees by Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO), with the aim of
  cutting the number of incidents where a player’s movement is impeded by an
  opponent. It follows consultation with club officials and leading players who
  all complained about the practice. “The feedback that we had is that there’s
  just a few too many examples of players clearly pulling people back, impacting
  their ability to move to the ball, or some clear extreme actions are not being
  penalised,” said Webb, the chief referee officer, before the Premier League
  season starts on Friday night. “They’re the ones I expect us to catch.
  Therefore I would expect this time next year for there to have been a few more
  penalties given for holding offences than what we’ve seen this year. But not a
  huge swing of the pendulum.” The new guidance allows space for referees to
  analyse instances of holding and assess how severe or extreme it may be. The
  criteria a referee is expected to consider include: the length of time a
  player is held for; the extent of the impact on their ability to move; the
  nature of the opponent’s efforts to impede movement; whether both arms are
  being used. A crackdown on holding has been promised before, but without any
  real impact. Webb says the key will be to approach any changes slowly and
  consistently. “This is not meant to be a six-week campaign, August and
  September, then we forget all about it,” he said. “If we went in like a steam
  train and gave every little bit of sort of contact then it would tell you it
  would be a six-week campaign. Because we would get told very quickly to ease
  off from what we’re doing. We have to take the game with us and we have to be
  credible. We have to identify those situations that do fall in line with the
  feedback that we had.” Webb cited changes to the handball law in recent
  seasons as a model to follow. It is one of the most contentious laws and PGMO
  adopted a more lenient interpretation to limit the number of gamechanging
  decisions made off the back of subjective handball calls. Research by the
  Premier League found that 78% of stakeholders said they supported the approach
  taken last season and wanted it to continue. “That’s why we want to survey the
  game,” Webb said. “Because when I listen to the game [we can] make those
  tweaks where we think we need to be better, to fall in line with those
  expectations. And I think we did that with handball pretty successfully.”
  Meanwhile, the chief executive of the Premier League, Richard Masters,
  repeated his challenges to Fifa over the international match calendar, with
  the league part of a legal action against the global governing body over a
  perceived lack of consultation on the issue and with concerns that leagues
  could be asked to downsize to incorporate more tournaments such as the Club
  World Cup. “My view is that it should be up to the Premier League shareholders
  to decide what size the league is and it shouldn’t be imposed any way from
  above,” he said. “The calendar shouldn’t be carved up in a way which
  essentially blocks out a 20-club league. I don’t believe that’s the right way
  forward and as far as I’m concerned it’s not on the cards. Obviously Fifa was
  put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international
  football and the Club World Cup is a move into club football.” This season the
  Premier League begins a new four-year domestic TV rights deal with Sky and TNT
  Sports, with more games available to view than ever. Despite a decline in the
  value of broadcast rights in most markets, the league continues to grow its
  broadcast revenues and Masters said he saw no reason for the longstanding
  relationship with Sky, especially, to change. “I don’t feel that there’s
  anything to stop further agreements of this kind continuing,” he said.
