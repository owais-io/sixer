  The Last Dinner Party pulled out of their set at Portsmouth’s Victorious
  festival at the weekend after Irish band the Mary Wallopers saw their set cut
  short after saying “free Palestine and fuck Israel”. On Friday, the Mary
  Wallopers walked onstage and unveiled a Palestinian flag alongside their
  opening remarks. Video appeared to show a crew member confronting the band
  about the flag, which was draped on the stage, and then removing it. After
  calls from the band and the crowd of “free, free Palestine”, the sound was
  cut. The band briefly retrieved the flag to cheers. A representative for the
  festival initially said that the show was cut short after the band used “a
  chant which is widely understood to have a discriminatory context”. On
  Instagram, the Mary Wallopers disputed this, posting footage of the incident.
  “The festival have released a misleading statement to the press claiming they
  cut our sound because of a discriminatory chant and not the band’s call to
  Free Palestine. Our video clearly shows a Victorious crew member coming on
  stage, interfering with our show, removing the flag from the stage and then
  the sound being cut following a chant of ‘Free Palestine’. The same crew
  member is later heard in the video saying ‘you aren’t playing until the flag
  is removed’. “We completely reject Victorious’ portrayal of today’s events and
  request that they retract their statement immediately.” Victorious put out a
  subsequent statement apologising for the situation. “We are in the business of
  putting on great shows, not cutting them off and this is the last thing we
  wanted, for the band, their fans and ourselves. We didn’t handle the
  explanation of our policies sensitively or far enough in advance to allow a
  sensible conclusion to be reached. This put the band and our own team in a
  difficult situation which never should have arisen. We would like to sincerely
  apologise to all involved. “We absolutely support the right of artists to
  freely express their views from the stage, within the law and the inclusive
  nature of the event. Our policy of not allowing flags of any kind, which has
  been in place for many years for wider event management and safety reasons, is
  not meant to compromise that right.” The organisers accepted the band’s
  version of the events and said they would be making “a substantial donation to
  humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people”. In response to the
  Mary Walloper’s set being pulled, British band the Last Dinner Party cancelled
  their scheduled Saturday performance at the festival. “We are outraged by the
  decision made to silence the Mary Wallopers yesterday at Victorious,” they
  posted on Instagram. “As a band we cannot cosign political censorship and will
  therefore be boycotting the festival today.” The decision also drew
  condemnation from US band Vampire Weekend, who went ahead with their
  performance at Victorious on Saturday night. Frontman Ezra Koenig told the
  crowd: “If someone was punished for flying a flag, that is wrong and they
  deserve an apology. The terrible suffering of the Palestinian people deserves
  all of our sympathy.” Additionally this weekend, the BBC explained that it had
  “mutually agreed” with Reading and Leeds headliner Hozier ahead of the
  festivals that it would not broadcast his set. Onstage, the Irish musician
  called for a free Palestine and a “meaningful political solution for the kind
  of violence we’ve been seeing on our TV screens over the last two years – not
  lip service, but a meaningful peace process”. • This article was amended on 25
  August 2025 to reflect the Mary Wallopers’ full remarks.
