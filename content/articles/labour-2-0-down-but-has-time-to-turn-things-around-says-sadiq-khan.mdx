  Labour would be 2-0 down were its time in government a football match, one of
  the party’s most senior figures has said, as he admitted its first year in
  office has been difficult. But Sadiq Khan stressed Labour still had plenty of
  time to win round the public. Speaking at the Edinburgh festival fringe, the
  London mayor said Labour supporters would be “delusional” if they did not
  recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024.
  “It is really important now we pick things up because I think we are 2-0
  down.” Continuing his analogy, he said only 15 or 20 minutes of the match had
  gone, adding: “The great news is we have turned it round before; we have won
  games before where we’re 2-0 down, we can do it again.” After taking Labour
  into Downing Street for the first time since 2010, the party’s popularity has
  slumped in the polls, amid criticism over issues such as changes to welfare.
  Khan said: “It hasn’t been a great first year. There have been great things
  that have happened in this first year, around the rights for renters, around
  the rights for workers, around energy security, and I could go on. But as
  first years go, it has not been a great first year.” He said his party had
  “another four years to make sure we turn this around”. Speaking at the same
  event, Khan said he would be “more than happy” to meet Donald Trump – despite
  warning that the US president could be “inadvertently radicalising people” and
  is “not a force for good”. He dismissed jibes Trump made against him on a
  recent visit to Scotland, where the president claimed the London mayor was “a
  nasty person” who has “done a terrible job”. The Labour politician said such
  remarks were “water off a duck’s back”. But he told the audience it sometimes
  felt as if he was nine years old again and “in the school playground”. Khan
  hit back at Trump, saying: “Somebody who has views like he does about black
  people, about women, about gays, about Muslims, about Mexicans, thinks I’m
  nasty. Really. He is the leader of the free world, arguably the most powerful
  man in the world, and really.” He said records showed that, from the date
  Trump started his term in January up to July, “there have never been more
  Americans applying for British citizenship and living in London. So I think
  Americans have got good taste by and large”. He added that he hoped the
  president would come to London during his state visit to the UK next month,
  with Khan stressing the diversity of the capital was a “strength, not a
  weakness” that made the city “richer not poorer”. He said: “When President
  Trump says some of the things he does, it brings from the periphery to the
  mainstream, views that are potentially dangerous”. Khan added: “He
  inadvertently – I’m not going to suggest he does it deliberately – he
  inadvertently could be radicalising people with views that could lead to them
  doing things that are dangerous.”
