  Benjamin Netanyahu has criticised massive street protests against his handling
  of the Gaza war, and failure to secure the release of remaining Israeli
  hostages, suggesting demonstrators were giving comfort to Hamas’s position in
  negotiations. The Israeli prime minister made his comments against the
  backdrop of the largest protests in almost two years of war, with estimates
  that upwards of 400,000 people joined marches across Israel on Sunday. “The
  people who are calling today for the war’s end without Hamas’s defeat are not
  only toughening Hamas’s stance and distancing our hostages’ release, they are
  also ensuring that the atrocities of October 7 will recur time and again, and
  that our sons and daughters will have to fight time and again in an endless
  war. “Therefore, in order to advance our hostages’ release and to ensure that
  Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel, we have to finish the job and defeat
  Hamas,” said Netanyahu in a statement. The Palestinian health ministry said on
  Monday that more than 62,000 Palestinians had been killed in the 22-month war
  in Gaza. At least 60 people were killed in the past 24 hours, bringing to to
  62,004 the death toll from the Israel-Hamas war that started on 7 October
  2023. A further 156,230 had been wounded, the ministry said. While the day of
  protest was called by supporters of Israeli hostage families, the scale of the
  demonstrations suggests increasingly sharp divisions in Israeli society over a
  conflict that has yet to deliver the return of hostages at a mounting
  economic, diplomatic and social cost for the country. With 50 hostages still
  held in Gaza – of whom about 20 are believed still to be alive – some of those
  attending the march carried signs referencing the death of the dual US-Israeli
  citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was killed by his captors last October along
  with five other hostages as Israeli troops approached where they were being
  held. Placards repeated a sentiment expressed by Goldberg-Polin’s father at
  his son’s funeral – “may your memory be a revolution” – adapting the familiar
  Jewish expression of condolence “may your memory be a blessing”. Responding to
  Netanyahu’s remarks, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum lambasted the
  Israeli prime minister, saying: “They have been languishing in Gaza for 22
  months, on your watch.” Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal
  court over allegations of war crimes in Gaza, was also fiercely criticised by
  the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Golan, as a man who “lies as he breathes”.
  He said: “The man who time and again refused to eliminate Hamas’s leaders
  before October 7, who funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars from Qatar to
  finance the tunnels and weapons that threaten our hostages. “This is the same
  Netanyahu who strengthened Hamas back then, and it is he who is strengthening
  Hamas now as well. Netanyahu doesn’t know how to win and doesn’t want to free
  the hostages. He needs an eternal war in order to cling to his seat and to
  escape a commission of inquiry [into the 7 October Hamas attack that triggered
  the war]. “Israel will be liberated from Hamas only once we are liberated from
  the government of Netanyahu, and [his far-right allies Bezalel] Smotrich and
  [Itamar] Ben-Gvir.” The protests follow the decision by the Israeli cabinet
  earlier this month to launch a new military operation in Gaza City despite
  warnings by security officials it would put the lives of the remaining
  hostages in peril. On Monday, Netanyahu appeared to receive the public support
  of the US president for his strategy. Donald Trump wrote on social media: “We
  will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted
  and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of
  success will be.” Amid the threat of an imminent Israeli ground offensive,
  thousands of Palestinians are leaving their homes in eastern areas of Gaza
  City, under constant Israeli bombardment, for points to the west and south of
  the shattered territory. Israel’s plan to seize control of Gaza City has
  stirred alarm abroad and at home, where tens of thousands of Israelis held
  some of the largest protests seen since the war began, urging a deal to end
  the fighting and free the remaining hostages. The planned offensive has
  spurred Egyptian and Qatari ceasefire mediators to step up efforts in what a
  source familiar with the talks with Hamas militants in Cairo said could be
  “the last-ditch attempt”. Netanyahu has described Gaza City as Hamas’s last
  big urban bastion. But, with Israel already holding 75% of Gaza, the military
  has warned that expanding the offensive could endanger hostages still alive
  and draw troops into protracted and deadly guerrilla warfare.
