  Donald Trump made his first public appearance in a week on Tuesday to announce
  that the US Space Command (Spacecom) headquarters, which is tasked with
  leading national security operations in space, would be in the Republican
  stronghold of Alabama. Flanked by Republican senators and members of Congress
  at a White House news conference, Trump said Huntsville, Alabama, would be the
  new location of the space command. The move reverses a Biden administration
  decision to put the facility at its current temporary headquarters in
  Democratic-leaning Colorado. “The US Space Command headquarters will move to
  the beautiful locale of a place called Huntsville, Alabama, forever to be
  known from this point forward as Rocket City,” Trump said. “We had a lot of
  competition but Alabama’s getting it.” The move would result in more than
  30,000 new jobs and bring hundreds of billions of dollars to Alabama, a state
  which voted for Trump “by about 47 points”, the president said. “They fought
  harder for it than anyone else,” Trump claimed, before adding that Colorado’s
  decision to allow mail-in voting was “corrupt”. “The problem I have with
  Colorado, one of the big problems, [is that] they do mail-in voting,” he said.
  “So they have automatically crooked elections and we can’t have that. When a
  state is for mail-in voting, that means they want dishonest elections. So that
  played a big factor.” Huntsville is already home to the US Army Space and
  Missile Defense Command, Nasa’s Marshall Space Flight center and the
  38,000-acre Redstone Arsenal. The city was identified by the US air force as
  its preferred site for Space Command in 2021 as it would be a cost-effective
  option. A report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) later found
  that the air force’s decision-making process had “significant shortfalls in
  its transparency and credibility”. Two years later, in 2023, Biden overturned
  those plans to relocate to Alabama. Instead, Biden chose to make the then
  temporary Colorado Springs location permanent, taking a recommendation from
  Gen James Dickinson, the former head of Space Command. Dickinson reportedly
  said relocating to Alabama could jeopardize military readiness as making the
  headquarters fully operational would take time. “For FOUR YEARS, I have fought
  to get U.S. Space Command moved to its SELECTED home at Redstone Arsenal in
  Huntsville, Alabama,” Senator Tommy Tuberville wrote alongside a video
  statement after Trump’s announcement. “Thank you, President Trump and
  Secretary [Pete] Hegseth, for reversing Joe Biden’s political cronyism and
  restoring MERIT and INTEGRITY to this process.” Tuberville lambasted Biden’s
  2023 decision to keep Spacecom in Colorado Springs in his video and said the
  former president let the “nation’s security [take] a backseat to politics” and
  “caved” to “woke politics” at the time. He then thanked Trump for “restoring
  merit and integrity” to space exploration and alleged the move would save
  taxpayers $480m. Trump’s announcement of a change of course followed days of
  fevered online speculation about his health, fueled by his absence from the
  public eye since last week. Asked if he was aware that there had been 1.3m
  social media engagements as of Saturday morning speculating on his possible
  “demise”, Trump countered that he had held several news conferences in the
  past week and pointed to some “pretty poignant” posts he had made on his Truth
  Social platform. “I did numerous news conferences, all successful. They went
  very well, like this is going very well. And then I didn’t do any for two
  days, and they said, ‘There must be something wrong with him,’” he said.
  “Biden wouldn’t do them for months, you wouldn’t see him, and nobody ever said
  there was ever anything wrong with him – and we know he wasn’t in the greatest
  of shape. It’s all fake news.” Speculation about Trump’s health has recently
  intensified. Some of the fervor has been spurred by a White House disclosure
  that he was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a condition involving
  damage to the veins in the arms and legs. There has also been viral pictures
  showing Trump with swollen ankles and bruising on his hands. Elsewhere in his
  announcement, Trump indicated that he had decided to send armed troops into
  Chicago, allegedly to fight crime. Such a move is against the will of JB
  Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, and follows the recent controversial
  deployment of national guard forces in Washington on the same purported basis.
  “We’re going in,” he said, calling Chicago and Baltimore – another
  Democratic-run city – “hellholes”. He said the deployment of national guard
  troops in Washington DC had “served as a template,” adding: “I’m very proud of
  Washington. [It’s] a safe zone.”
