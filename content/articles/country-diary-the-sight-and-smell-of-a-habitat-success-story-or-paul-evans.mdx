  A shower of rain finds Nipstone Rock. After days of oppressive heat, there’s a
  scent released from the heath: peaty earth, heather, glistening stone. Smell
  is an associative sense and, like a shared memory, we’re returned to a place
  from an earlier age that is refreshed – innocent yet fiercely “singular”, as
  Tom Wall, who was the first warden of the Stiperstones national nature reserve
  (NNR), puts it. This feeling of restoration is why we’re here. Rain dampens a
  group of conservationists at the Nipstone Rock, but not their enthusiasm to
  celebrate new additions to the Stiperstones NNR, tripling its size. Tony
  Juniper, the chair of Natural England, says the extended Stiperstones is
  number 11 of the 25 new NNRs that are being created under the “King’s series”
  banner. The series marks a change: from 70 years of traditional protection of
  remnants of wildlife habitats to a focus on the ecological restoration of
  landscapes and creating a jigsaw of places for communities and the natural
  world. This is nature restoration based on the “Lawton principles” of bigger,
  better, more and joined-up habitats, making them resilient ecological
  networks. Here, we’re celebrating in particular the inclusion of the Middle
  Marches Community Land Trust’s new sites at Minsterley Meadows – which hold
  5,000 green-winged orchids, and Norbury Hill, a crucial stepping stone between
  the upland heaths of the Stiperstones and the Long Mynd – in the Stiperstones
  NNR. A remarkable achievement for a community organisation. At Nipstone Rock
  25 years ago, I reported on a restoration scheme called “Back to Purple”.
  Then, a plantation of conifers was felled, a horse pulled a hawthorn tree to
  harrow the blanket of conifer needles, and seed was sprayed by helicopter. The
  resulting dense swathes of deep heather are wonderful, particularly for the
  fabulous emperor moth. I was as fascinated then as I am now about what it is
  we are restoring. The singularity of the Stiperstones landscape is mysterious
  and strange, qualities that persist beyond human intervention. We cannot
  restore its old mining communities; or the novels of Mary Webb, set in this
  world “betwixt and between” ours and the “world of faery”; or what DH Lawrence
  described as “the old savage England”. Our obligation now is to the
  more-than-human. They hold the magic of this place. • Under the Changing
