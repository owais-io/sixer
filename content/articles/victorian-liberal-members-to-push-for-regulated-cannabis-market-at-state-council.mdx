  Rank-and-file Victorian Liberal party members will use this month’s state
  council meeting to push for a regulated cannabis market for adult use,
  overhaul heritage and planning laws to tackle the housing crisis and introduce
  a full year of parental leave with a “daddy quota”. The motions are among 62
  on the draft agenda for the Victorian Liberal state council – the party’s
  annual general meeting – on 12-13 September. Other motions include proposals
  to scrap net zero targets, renters’ rights reforms and diversity quotas. The
  motions are non-binding on either the state or federal parliamentary parties
  but provide an insight into the policy direction of Liberal membership. Put
  forward by former Liberal staffer turned lobbyist Mark Briers, the cannabis
  motion calls on the state party to adopt a policy to establish a regulated
  retail market of licensed cannabis dispensaries. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Under the proposal, cannabis would be treated similar to alcohol, with a
  state tax on sales benchmarked to the federal government’s existing alcohol
  excise duty for beer. Of this tax, 70% would to go to reducing state debt and
  the remaining 30% to funding drug and alcohol support services. “By legalising
  the sale of products (as we already do via prescription) and charging an
  excise, just as we do with alcohol, we allow Victorian adults to exercise
  freedom of choice; remove an unnecessary regulation/barrier in requiring a
  prescription, break the business model of criminals and collect desperately
  needed tax revenue for our state to pay down Labor’s debt,” the motion reads.
  Economic modelling commissioned by the drug research and advocacy group the
  Penington Institute, published in July, showed a regulated adult-use cannabis
  market could inject $10bn into Victoria’s economy over a decade. That same
  month, the Penington Institute also released YouGov polling found that 57% of
  Victorians support allowing “adults to buy cannabis legally – similar to
  alcohol – but with stricter safety and regulatory controls”. The chief
  executive of the Pennington Institute, John Ryan, welcomed the conference
  motion, saying measures to reduce drug harm and improve community safety
  “should be above politics”. “Cannabis regulation is a common sense reform that
  all political parties should get behind,” he said. “It’s time we moved on from
  the failed prohibition and law enforcement approaches of the past.” In the
  mid-1990s, then Liberal premier Jeff Kennett was supportive of decriminalising
  the use of cannabis, but was overruled by his party. Kennett also set up a
  drug advisory council led by David Penington, for whom the Penington Institute
  is named. The Victorian Liberals’ policy forums committee – made of
  rank-and-file members – also have put forward several motions, including
  reforms to the Heritage Act to “prevent the misuse of heritage protection that
  can impede housing development”. They also call for changes to planning laws
  to create a uniform set of standardised planning controls tied to zoning
  categories. These changes would replace various local policies and overlays
  with a single standardised set of rules – a move welcomed by housing advocacy
  group Yimby Melbourne. “It’s a great signal that the Liberal party is
  beginning to recognise that there is a problem with the local opposition to
  housing we desperately need,” lead organiser Jonathan O’Brien said. “Bringing
  down red tape is traditionally a Liberal idea, right?” The policy forum
  committee will also move a motion urging the federal Liberal party to
  introduce 52 weeks of paid parental leave, with 26 weeks paid at a full wage
  and the remaining 26 at the national minimum wage. This would include a “daddy
  quota” that would give the second parent a non-transferable four-week leave
  entitlement to use within the year. Other proposals are not dissimilar to
  those put forward at recent Queensland and Western Australia conferences. They
  include a push to abandon net zero by 2025, reverse a federal ban on live
  exports, “protect sport for women and girls” and a reject gender or diversity
  quotas. A motion put forward by the Mornington-Mt Martha branch also calls on
  a future state Liberal government to scrap Labor’s rental reforms, which allow
  tenants to have pets, make minor modifications without consent and require
  electrical and gas inspections by landlords every two years. They said the
  changes had “pushed many landlords to sell their properties”. The Victorian
  Liberals’ administrative committee, including party president, will also be up
  for re-election at the state council. In a statement, a Victorian Liberal
  spokesperson said: “Motions proposed and considered at State Council are not
  binding on the State Parliamentary Party, and will be considered and responded
  to in the usual way.”
