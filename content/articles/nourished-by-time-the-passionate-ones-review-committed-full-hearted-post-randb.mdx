  Nourished By Time: The Passionate Ones review – committed, full-hearted

  Marcus Brown is a diehard romantic. His second album as Nourished By Time
  might be darker and more dystopian than his critically acclaimed debut, but at
  its core remains a bloody, beating heart. Absorbing and cinematic, The
  Passionate Ones expands Brown’s unique vision for post-R&amp;B: his aching,
  tremulous, earthy vocals swim under rolling Baltimore club breakbeats,
  flickering synths, gated reverb and uncanny looping samples. And all the
  while, he makes a plea for big feelings in the face of a numbing world.
  Blaring as if from a busted speaker, opening track Automatic Love transforms
  boyband-y platitudes – “my body won’t feel nothing until my skin touches you”
  – into lyrics with real jeopardy, sharpened by the threat of looming societal
  collapse. Max Potential, a big 80s synth-rock number, co-opts corporate
  language to marvel at the pain of heartbreak, treating it as a fluorescent
  sign of life. Often Brown sings with such wide-mouthed, full-hearted
  commitment that he could be laughing or crying, but single Baby Baby is witty
  and aloof, with casual talk-singing and a surfy guitar line as he calls for a
  global strike to “make the gravy train stop”. A tongue-in-cheek interlude
  wonders aloud if The Passionate Ones could be a cult – one dedicated to
  intensity, drive, even optimism, over any ideology. To hook you in, it’s
  followed by 9 2 5, a spirit-soaring song of the summer contender about
  artistic dreams v greasy day job monotony. Real passion is precious, Brown
  urges, shaking you by the shoulders, hoping you’ll see the light.
