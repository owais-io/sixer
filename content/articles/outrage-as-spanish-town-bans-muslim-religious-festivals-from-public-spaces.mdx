  A local authority in south-east Spain has banned Muslims from using public
  facilities such as civic centres and gyms to celebrate the religious festivals
  Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, and Eid al-Adha. The ban in
  Jumilla, in Murcia, is a first in Spain. It was introduced by the conservative
  People’s party (PP) and passed with the abstention of the far-right Vox party
  and the opposition of local leftwing parties. The proposal states “municipal
  sports facilities cannot be used for religious, cultural or social activities
  alien to our identity unless organised by the local authority”. The local Vox
  party posted on X: “Thanks to Vox the first measure to ban Islamic festivals
  in Spain’s public spaces has been passed. Spain is and will be forever the
  land of Christian people.” Mounir Benjelloun Andaloussi Azhari, president of
  the Spanish federation of Islamic organisations, told El País newspaper the
  proposal was “Islamophobic and discriminatory”. “They’re not going after other
  religions, they’re going after ours,” he said. Referring to the recent rise of
  racist rhetoric and attacks, he added: “We’re rather surprised by what’s
  happening in Spain. For the first time in 30 years I feel afraid.” Jumilla has
  a population of about 27,000, of whom 7.5% come from largely Muslim countries.
  The decision is bound to be challenged as it contravenes article 16 of the
  Spanish constitution, which states: “Freedom of ideology, religion and worship
  of individuals and communities is guaranteed, with no other restriction on
  their expression than may be necessary to maintain public order as protected
  by law”. Francisco Lucas, the socialist leader in Murcia, said on X: “The PP
  violates the constitution and puts social cohesion as risk simply in the
  pursuit of power.” Juana Guardiola, a former socialist mayor of Jumilla, said:
  “What do they mean by identity? And what about the centuries of Muslim legacy
  here?” Jumilla was part of the Roman empire, and then the Visigothic kingdom,
  until the Arab conquest in the eighth century. As Yumil-la it remained a
  principally Arab town for centuries until it was attacked by Christian troops
  led by Alfonso X of Castile in the mid-13th century. The local Arab ruler
  reached an agreement under which Alfonso could be king as long as the rights
  of the existing population were respected. However, shortly after Alfonso’s
  death Castile invaded Jumilla, ending Arab rule.
