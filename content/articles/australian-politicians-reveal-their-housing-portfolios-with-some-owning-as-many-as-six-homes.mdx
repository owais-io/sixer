  More than half the politicians in federal parliament have disclosed owning
  investment properties or multiple homes, with at least 50 receiving rental
  income as landlords. The enviable property portfolios of some of the nation’s
  most powerful parliamentarians have been revealed – including holiday homes,
  beach shacks, second houses interstate and overseas real estate – as the
  federal government considers ways to fix Australia’s housing shortage.
  Guardian Australia analysis of the parliamentary register of interests finds
  131 out of 226 federal MPs and senators have disclosed multiple properties,
  investment properties, or both. At least 92 have disclosed properties they
  have listed as investment, rental or “landlord”. Some 125 politicians – 56% of
  the parliament – have declared owning multiple properties. Another six have
  declared just a single property, which they list as an investment, disclosing
  no ownership of residential property. Michelle Ananda-Rajah, the Labor MP
  turned senator for Victoria, has the highest number, with six properties all
  listed as “residential/investment”; including three in her native Melbourne,
  one each in Brisbane and Beaumaris in coastal Tasmania, and another in rural
  Victoria’s Porepunkah. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Tony Burke, the home
  affairs minister, also has six properties listed: two residential homes in
  Sydney and Canberra, as well as four investments, with three in Tasmania and
  another in Victoria’s Port Phillip. Rising star Labor assistant minister
  Andrew Charlton has listed a portfolio of five “residential investment”
  properties, including homes in well-heeled Sydney suburbs including Bellevue
  Hill, Woollahra and the northern beaches. Anthony Albanese, who lives at the
  prime minister’s residence The Lodge in Canberra, has listed two investment
  properties. His Central Coast cliffside home is declared as an investment –
  which he notes is “joint with spouse”, fiancee Jodie Haydon – and another
  property at Marrickville is listed as “former home/investment”. The opposition
  leader, Sussan Ley, has declared four properties: a residential and two
  investment homes in Albury, and another investment property on the Gold Coast.
  The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared two private residences, one
  in Canberra and another in Queensland, as well as his own investment on the
  Gold Coast. Guardian Australia’s analysis includes only properties declared by
  the parliamentarian themselves, not their partners or children. Many
  politicians note further extensive real estate holdings from their spouses;
  the Liberal MP Ben Small, for instance, notes two residential properties in
  his own name, and another five in total held by his partner. Michelle Rowland,
  the attorney general, has listed two “residential investment” properties at
  Potts Point and Caves Beach. Additionally she declared that a trust, in which
  she owns a share, operates “real property investments in Glenwood, Randwick
  and Kingston”. The Labor senator Deborah O’Neill has listed five of her own,
  with one home at Copacabana on the New South Wales central coast – the same
  suburb as Albanese’s beachside home – and four investment properties spread
  across Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. Labor’s
  housing minister, Clare O’Neil, has listed one residential property only; her
  shadow counterpart, Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, has also only listed a
  single residential home, as has the Greens leader, Larissa Waters. The Greens
  senator Mehreen Faruqi has listed two homes at Beaconsfield, in Sydney’s inner
  south, one residential and one investment, as well as rental income derived
  from that property. Her fellow Greens senator Nick McKim, from Tasmania,
  declared four properties, including a home in Hobart, a shack and agricultural
  land at Nubeena, and a residential property in New Norfolk he notes is
  “tenanted to family member”. The independent MP Allegra Spender declared three
  properties: a home in Darling Point, a holiday house at Great Mackerel Beach,
  and a property in Woollahra listed as an “estate asset”. Sophie Scamps has
  listed a family home and a separate investment property in Avalon Beach, a
  hobby farm in Tasmania, and a “bush block – no house” at Wee Jasper outside
  Canberra. Dozens of politicians are landlords – having also declared receiving
  rental income or income from their investments, including federal ministers
  Burke, Charlton, Tim Ayres, Kristy McBain, and Catherine King; Liberals
  including Dan Tehan, Bridget McKenzie, Sarah Henderson and Michaelia Cash; and
  independents such as Faruqi, Zali Steggall and Andrew Gee. Other MPs have
  listed overseas property. The Labor MP Steve Georganas listed three
  properties, including a “block of unconstructed residential land
  (inheritance)” in Greece. He also declared ownership of “a small block of farm
  land (olive groves) in Greece”. The Labor minister Tanya Plibersek listed four
  properties, including residential homes in Sydney and Canberra, an investment
  in Sydney and a second investment in Ljubljana, Slovenia. As of Tuesday, the
  maverick Queensland MP Bob Katter is the only lower house member not to have
  lodged his register of interests.
