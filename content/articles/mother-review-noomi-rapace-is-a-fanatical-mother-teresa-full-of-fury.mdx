  The convent is a pressure cooker in this fevered, energetic account of a
  pivotal week in the life of the young Mother Teresa, which jump-starts the
  Orizzonti sidebar at this year’s Venice film festival. Macedonian
  writer-director Teona Strugar Mitevska ticks down the days from seven to one
  and wrings a performance of flayed, hard-bitten intensity from Noomi Rapace,
  who marches down the corridors with a face full of fury. Rapace is a long way
  from her breakout role in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; tonally, though,
  not so much. If Mother Teresa never goes so far as to set about the sisters
  with an axe, the sense that she might injects Mitevska’s film with a pleasing
  dose of danger. It is 1948, we’re in the broiling heart of Kolkata and Sister
  Teresa has tired of her teaching role at the Loreto Entally convent. “I’m a
  woman in a system run by men,” she complains to sympathetic Father Friedrich
  (Nikola Ristanovski), although she has also heard a call from the big man
  upstairs. Teresa applies to the Vatican for permission to set up her own
  mission, but the response takes an age, her patience wears thin and she has a
  more immediate problem. When her heir apparent, Sister Agnieszka (Sylvia
  Hoeks), admits that she is pregnant, Teresa is duly scandalised. She loves
  Sister Agnieszka but is repulsed by her, too. “I would never jeopardise my
  mission for earthly pleasures,” she declares in one of many examples of overly
  on-the-nose dialogue. Ahead of the film’s premiere, Rapace billed the film as
  a “punk-rock” reframing of the 20th-century saint, although the handling is
  arguably more Euro-metal than punk. There’s plenty of reverb guitar on the
  soundtrack, culminating in an extended headbanging session as the brides of
  Christ dance on the convent landing at night. It’s an approach that finally
  generates more heat than light and leaves Teresa exposed but not necessarily
  examined. Teresa, it’s clear, is desperate to strike her own path and tend to
  the poor and the needy. But are these motives purely altruistic? In the
  opinion of the writer Christopher Hitchens, this white saviour was not a
  friend of the poor but of poverty itself, and viewed the slums of Kolkata as a
  happy hunting ground for impressionable Catholic converts. Mother does little
  to disabuse us of that view, although its frequent God’s-eye shots of the
  action leave open the possibility that a higher power is guiding her hand and
  testing her faith. Teresa treats Agnieszka’s pregnancy as an infuriating
  distraction, another mess to be cleaned up before she can make her escape. It
  may, though, be the great moral challenge by which her mission is judged. Time
  is running short and Teresa craves an answer. So now she picks up the pace,
  steamrolling through the convent like a heaven-sent Nurse Ratched. She’s
  wiping the blood off the sisters’ wimples. She’s plucking maggots out of the
  body of a wounded beggar, who giggles and masturbates throughout the
  procedure. Her eyes are glittering; her skin looks as taut as a drum. Teresa
  is torn and the film is, too. As the clock ticks down to judgment day, Mother
  veers on and off the path of righteousness, constantly summoned back to its
  duties of presenting a faithful, fact-based account of its subject. But it’s
  at its best and most fun when it plays like a giallo horror movie: the lurid
  tale of a fanatical nun who’s confused God with Satan and herds her excitable
  flock right into the flames. • Mother screened at the Venice film festival.
