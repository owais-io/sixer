  What is the status of the US team? Six players have qualified automatically to
  represent the US in New York next month: Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele,
  JJ Spaun, Russell Henley, Harris English and Bryson DeChambeau. Keegan Bradley
  will name his half‑dozen wildcards on Wednesday. These announcements are
  ordinarily mundane; this one will be far from that. Justin Thomas and Collin
  Morikawa are certainties to be involved. Patrick Cantlay, who was central to
  so much drama in Rome two years ago, is also likely to get the nod. The
  remaining three spots realistically appear to be between four names: Cameron
  Young, Ben Griffin, Sam Burns and Bradley himself. Of those, Young and Burns
  are most hotly tipped to make the US team. Bradley added a layer of intrigue
  on Sunday by stating: “There’s probably going to be a few guys that think they
  are going to be on the team that aren’t going to be.” Why is Bradley’s
  decision so significant? There has been no playing captain in the Ryder Cup
  since 1963 and back then Arnold Palmer did not have to pick himself. Bradley
  has clearly agonised over this decision, describing it as “defining” and “the
  biggest of my life”. Bradley regards himself as one of the finest players in
  the game and there is logic behind that. He is ranked 11 in the world and
  eighth among Americans. However, the scale of duties associated with
  captaining a modern Ryder Cup team mean many regard the concept of combining
  this with playing to be nonsensical. Should Bradley play and the US fall to a
  rare home defeat, inevitably he will be criticised for being self-indulgent.
  If Bradley stays on the sidelines and the same result plays out, fans will ask
  why he did not help the team inside the ropes where he is most accustomed.
  There are subplots; Bradley was hugely upset not to receive a pick for the
  last Ryder Cup team. US players will receive $500,000 (£370,000) each for
  participation at Bethpage, $300,000 of which must be directed towards charity.
  While it is easy to say money does not matter in this context, that
  contradicts the fact those players lobbied for the payment in the first place.
  What is the case for not playing? The mood music at East Lake and the Tour
  Championship early last week suggested this would be Bradley’s decision, owing
  to a growing understanding of how much time and energy his captaincy will take
  up. However, the 39-year-old duly produced his best form in weeks, including
  rounds of 64 and 63, to tie seventh. Taken at face value, Bradley is in a
  quandary over what to do. Griffin would be a Ryder Cup rookie but posted
  top-10 finishes in two of 2025’s majors. He won twice on the PGA Tour in
  spring. Bradley can reasonably say there is sufficient depth elsewhere on the
  American side that he needn’t become the focus of attention with a dual role.
  There would also be no risk of “we told you so” as the prime criticism if the
  Ryder Cup goes wrong for the hosts. And what is the case for playing? Maybe
  the role of the Ryder Cup captain is overstated. It feels quite feasible, for
  example, that Bradley could use the Friday and Saturday mornings to make
  decisions (albeit most of them are made before a ball is struck anyway) before
  taking to the course in the afternoon sessions. His commitments would also be
  shared between a batch of vice‑captains. One of them, Jim Furyk, has
  previously captained Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup teams. Several players in
  the US team clearly want Bradley to tee up alongside them. How influential
  those voices are remains to be seen. In the past year Bradley has played some
  of the finest golf of his life, as epitomised by seeing off Tommy Fleetwood
  and Henley to win the Travelers Championship in June. This will not be
  Bradley’s concern but a playing captain, such a rarity, would add a gloriously
  intriguing storyline to Ryder Cup week. How are the European team placed in
  comparison? In a much more settled state. Rory McIlroy, Bob MacIntyre, Justin
  Rose, Tommy Fleetwood, Rasmus Højgaard and Tyrrell Hatton are automatic
  qualifiers. Fleetwood is in the form of his life and ended his wait for a win
  in the US on Sunday. Every expectation is that the captain, Luke Donald, will
  apply continuity when making his picks next Monday. Shane Lowry, Sepp Straka,
  Ludvig Åberg, Viktor Hovland, Matt Fitzpatrick and Jon Rahm are likely to get
  the nod. It will therefore be one change and a quirkish one at that from the
  team who defeated the US in Rome: Rasmus Højgaard replacing his twin brother,
  Nicolai. Alex Norén’s win at the British Masters following an injury‑disrupted
  spell did raise some eyebrows, the Swede forming part of Europe’s winning team
  in 2018. However, it will be a shock if Donald does not stick to the obvious
  names.
