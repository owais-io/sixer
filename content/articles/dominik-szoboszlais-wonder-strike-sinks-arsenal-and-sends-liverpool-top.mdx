  If Liverpool are to successfully defend their Premier League title, they will
  look back on the moment when Dominik Szoboszlai sank Arsenal with a late and
  showstopping free-kick as a foundation stone. There had been little between
  these teams, the only ones with 100% records at kick-off; pragmatism held sway
  for long spells. Or maybe it was the fear of defeat. Nobody wanted to
  countenance that, however early in the season this fixture came. Would Arsenal
  have taken a fourth Anfield draw in a row beforehand? The answer was probably
  yes and it appeared that Mikel Arteta had placed the emphasis on being
  difficult to beat, first and foremost. He loaded his lineup with physicality,
  playing Mikel Merino in the No 10 role rather than Martin Ødegaard, who was
  not fully fit. Or Eberechi Eze, the new signing, who was also among the
  substitutes. Which was a surprise. Arteta knew it would be tight; he wanted it
  to be that way – for his team to retain a puncher’s chance. Perhaps they could
  nick something from a set piece? He did not subscribe to the notion of fortune
  favouring the brave. In the end, Arteta got nothing, he and his players
  floored by what Szoboszlai produced with seven minutes of regulation time
  remaining. The free-kick was 30 yards out but the Hungary international made
  light of the distance with a stunning execution up and over the wall, the
  technique generating vicious dip and fade, leaving David Raya clutching at
  thin air. Szoboszlai brought precision to the party, too, placing the ball
  perfectly inside the goalkeeper’s right-hand post. It was the last day of
  August yet it was easy to see this as a marker from Liverpool; a declaration
  of intent. This is before they make their final moves in a blockbuster
  transfer window, in which they could still add Alexander Isak and Marc Guéhi
  and push their spending towards £500m. Arsenal were the better team in the
  first half, even if they created little. Neither team did across the piece. It
  was that kind of contest. But Liverpool rallied in the second period, the Kop
  making itself heard and if one team was going to score, it felt as though it
  would be them. Szoboszlai, who stood in at right-back for the injured Jeremie
  Frimpong, ensured it was a goal to remember. Thanks to Manchester City’s
  defeat at Brighton earlier in the day, Liverpool have a bit of daylight
  between themselves and both their principal rivals. Arsenal had to go back to
  September 2012 for their previous league win at Anfield; Arteta was a player
  for them that day as goals from Lukas Podolski and Santi Cazorla secured a 2-0
  victory. Arteta’s plan on this occasion was to be solid; to stop Liverpool
  from playing. To that end, it was a blow to lose William Saliba to an ankle
  injury in the early running. Injuries would be a theme of the day. Liverpool’s
  Ibrahima Konaté and Florian Wirtz also hobbled off. It was tense. Arsenal
  could feel their hearts thump when they tried to work their
  play-out-from‑the‑back patterns. Yet they got them to click in the initial
  exchanges; a sign of the personality that Arteta wanted to see. Martín
  Zubimendi was prominent. Arsenal’s aggressive press, meanwhile, was a feature.
  Liverpool had a few nervy moments as they attempted to build from their
  defensive third. It was possible to wonder whether a loose pass out and a
  turnover forced in a dangerous area would be decisive. The odds in the first
  half appeared to point towards Arsenal making something happen in this regard.
  Yet it was Liverpool who had the big moment on 34 minutes when Raya erred and
  Virgil van Dijk outmuscled Zubimendi. The Liverpool captain had a shooting
  opportunity only to look for Mohamed Salah and a pass that was not there. The
  creative quality was absent. Arteta’s team searched for Noni Madueke on the
  right; it was clear he had the pace to trouble Milos Kerkez. Twice in the
  first half Madueke almost got the better of his man. Kerkez, though, made
  last-ditch interventions. Madueke also worked Alisson after a corner broke for
  him. Liverpool had to free themselves from Arsenal’s headlock in the second
  half and they did so. They took higher starting positions. They brought
  greater intensity. Arne Slot was able to play Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan
  Gravenberch together in midfield for the first time this season and the latter
  came to flicker. At the back, Konaté bullied Viktor Gyökeres, giving him
  nothing. It was a mismatch; a painful one from an Arsenal point of view. Mac
  Allister fizzed a pass up to Wirtz, whose low shot Raya found too hot to
  handle. He spilled it to Cody Gakpo and then cleaned him out; an obvious
  penalty. Except that Gakpo was offside. The ball deflected in off Saliba’s
  replacement, Cristhian Mosquera, but it would not count. Arteta introduced
  Ødegaard and Eze for Merino and Gabriel Martinelli in the 70th minute and, by
  that point, the tide had turned, Liverpool pushing. Arsenal’s priority was
  their defensive shape. Declan Rice blocked a Salah shot after good work from
  Wirtz before Szoboszlai assumed centre stage.
