  Ukraine’s parliament will vote on a new law on Thursday that would restore
  independence to two anti-corruption bodies, backtracking on a law passed last
  week that curtailed their powers and led to a political crisis. Last week’s
  legal changes prompted rare wartime street protests against the president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and accusations that the presidential office was trying
  to protect powerful associates from anti-corruption investigations. Thousands
  of people took to the streets of Kyiv and other cities, while European leaders
  spoke with Zelenskyy and made it clear that funding for Kyiv could be affected
  if he was seen to be hampering anti-corruption efforts. Surprised and alarmed
  by the strength of the reaction, Zelenskyy announced late last week that he
  had listened to the criticism and would table a new law. A western diplomat
  based in Kyiv said: “It seems they really miscalculated, they completely
  underestimated the strength of the reaction.” On Wednesday evening about 2,000
  protesters came out again in rainy conditions to call on parliament to back
  the new law. The protesters, many of whom were teenagers, held handwritten
  signs with political jokes and memes. They sang the national anthem and
  chanted “Cancel the law!”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said
  the government hoped to fix the situation with the new law. “We anticipate the
  vote tomorrow. The relevant parliamentary committee has already given its
  approval. We are getting this fixed,” Sybiha said. The institutions in
  question are the national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the
  specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo. Both work independently
  of other law enforcement bodies specifically to target high-level corruption.
  Oleksandr Klymenko, the head of Sapo, told a small group of journalists in a
  briefing at his office in Kyiv on Wednesday that his office received a tipoff
  that measures were being prepared against them two weeks ago, but he had not
  expected the “blitzkrieg” assault that followed, with the law being rushed
  through parliament with little discussion. He said he hoped parliament would
  now pass the new law and that it would be ratified and enacted immediately.
  Explaining the hastily passed law last week, Zelenskyy said he feared Nabu and
  Sapo had been infiltrated by Russian agents, and also said he wanted to ensure
  closer cooperation between different law enforcement bodies. But this has been
  brushed off by many Ukrainians as excuses. Klymenko declined to blame
  Zelenskyy personally for the move against the two institutions but suggested
  it was “revenge” for taking on certain sensitive cases, and he defended the
  track record of the two bodies. “To say in 2025 that these bodies are
  ineffective is just absurd. It’s a narrative that is being spread to discredit
  us, we have information that they are looking for information to dump it in
  the media and just such a narrative that is now being spread in the media in
  order to somehow discredit us,” he said. Klymenko said Nabu and Sapo had
  opened investigations into 31 sitting MPs, and that the prospect of being
  caught meant fewer top officials risked engaging in corrupt activities. “The
  main thing about our work is the enormous preventive effect it has,” he said.
  He said last week’s law, as well as the arrest of two Nabu detectives, had
  left the agencies “confused and frightened” and could cause “lasting damage”
  even if the bill was reversed. Already, he said, government whistleblowers who
  were in communication with the agencies had gone dark, fearing their
  identities could be compromised. Several European leaders spoke with Zelenskyy
  last week about the law, urging him to find a way out of the crisis. “It was
  important for him to hear it from his peers,” said the diplomat. European
  officials have cautiously criticised the bill in public. “The dismantling of
  key safeguards protecting [anti-corruption bureau] Nabu’s independence is a
  serious step back,” the European commissioner for enlargement, Marta Kos,
  wrote on social media. She added that the two bodies were “essential” to keep
  Ukraine on the path to EU accession. A protest is planned for Kyiv on
  Wednesday evening, with the goal of “reminding MPs to do the right thing”,
  said Dmytro Koziatynskyi, a former combat medic who was the first to call
  people to protest last week. “This is not something I went to war for … and
  others on the frontline are not there so the government can do crazy stuff
  like this,” he said, explaining the source of the frustration that led him to
  demand protests. He said there was no chance of the protest turning
  revolutionary, with everyone in attendance acutely aware of the dangers of
  political destabilisation in wartime. He praised the government for being
  “ready for dialogue” and backtracking on the moves, and said the protests
  showed Ukrainian democracy was still strong even though the war had made
  elections impossible.
