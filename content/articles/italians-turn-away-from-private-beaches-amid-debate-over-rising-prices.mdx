  Italians appear to be snubbing beaches this summer, amid claims they are
  rebelling against the high prices charged by the owners of private beach
  concessions. Going to the beach and renting cabins, loungers and parasols –
  usually at the same location – has long been an ingrained habit of Italian
  summer holiday culture. But this year’s season began with a notable fall in
  beachgoer numbers after private resorts along Italy’s two long stretches of
  coastline recorded a decrease of between 15% and 25% in June and July compared
  with the same period in 2024. The problem is not so much the weekend, when
  beach resorts are often congested, especially those close to cities such as
  Rome, but during the week. Those who do go are also spending less on food and
  drink. Fabrizio Licordari, the president of Assobalneari Italia, an
  association representing beach clubs, blamed the decline on the high cost of
  living and its consequences on spending power. “Even with two salaries, many
  families struggle to reach the end of the month,” he told Ansa news agency.
  “In such circumstances, it’s natural that the first expenses to be cut are
  those for leisure, entertainment and holidays.” The drop in attendance,
  however, also coincides with increases in the cost of private beach resorts
  and the growing rebellion against their dominance of Italian shorelines, which
  has left very little space for free beaches. The cost of renting a sunlounger
  is a recurring topic of discussion, and rightly so – on average, it costs 17%
  more than it did four years ago, according to figures this week from the
  consumer group Altroconsumo. On beaches in the Lazio region, for example, it
  is difficult to rent two loungers and an umbrella for less than €30 (£26) a
  day. That rises to about €90 in the popular resort of Gallipoli in Puglia. The
  actor Alessandro Gassmann stoked the debate after sharing a photo of a beach
  with deserted loungers on his Instagram page and writing alongside it: “I read
  that the season is not going well. Maybe it’s because the prices are
  exaggerated and the country’s economic situation is forcing Italians to choose
  free beaches? Lower the prices and maybe things will get better.” Maurizio
  Rustignoli, the president of Fiba, the Italian beach resorts federation,
  argued that reports of high price rises were “misleading” and that, where they
  occurred, it was by only a small percentage. He added that people in return
  benefited from services including security and lifeguard supervision. But the
  consumers association Codacons said going to beach resorts had become “a
  drain” on people’s finances and accused the concession owners of “shedding
  crocodile tears”. The beaches might be losing custom, but areas in the
  mountains, especially the Dolomites, have had a significant rise in visitor
  numbers, with some areas fearing overtourism. According to a report this week
  in the newspaper Il Messaggero, more Italians are venturing to the mountains
  for their holidays, partly as a way to escape increasingly hot summers caused
  in part by the climate crisis.
