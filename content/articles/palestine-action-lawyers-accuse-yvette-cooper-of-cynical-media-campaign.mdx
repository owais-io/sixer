  Lawyers for a co-founder of Palestine Action have accused the home secretary
  of running a “cynical media campaign” which breaches her duty to the court in
  proceedings challenging the group’s proscription. In a letter sent to the
  government’s legal department on behalf of Huda Ammori, who has been granted
  permission for a judicial review of the decision to ban the group under the
  Terrorism Act, her lawyers say Yvette Cooper’s public statements are not
  backed by her disclosures at the high court. Birnberg Peirce write: “At the
  centre of your client’s media campaign is an attempt to persuade the public
  that Palestine Action was proscribed for reasons which she is unable to reveal
  publicly and which are centred on violence and injuries against people. “These
  claims about the reason for Proscription Review Group’s recommendation for the
  proscription of Palestine Action are misleading in light of open (public)
  disclosure. “It is clear from the open disclosure that the basis for the
  recommendation was serious damage to property caused by Palestine Action and
  not violence against people. “Indeed the central advice to your client was
  that proscribing Palestine Action would advance ‘the deterrent message of
  stating clearly that serious damage to property to advance a cause, amounts to
  terrorism regardless of the cause’.” While some of the evidence at the
  judicial review permission hearing was in closed court, meaning neither Ammori
  nor the lawyers representing her in open court have seen it, the letter states
  that “anything that your client feels able to share with the media should be
  in your client’s open case, even by way of gist”. It also highlights an
  opinion piece by Cooper in the Observer in which she referred to “disturbing
  information given to me that covered ideas and planning for future attacks [by
  Palestine Action]”. It says this has not been raised in open court nor have
  allegations made by Cooper, and also reportedly by Keir Starmer to Labour’s
  national executive committee (NEC), that Palestine Action targeted Jewish
  businesses. The letter says Cooper was “well aware” that the Jewish business
  in question was a landlord of a subsidiary of the Israeli arms manufacturer
  Elbit Systems. Additionally, it cites a report in the Times which said Home
  Office officials had briefed it that Palestine Action “may be funded by Iran”.
  A Whitehall intelligence assessment released to the high court stated that it
  was “primarily funded by donations”, including via crowdfunding, and also
  received revenue through the “sale of merchandise”. The letter states: “This
  cynical media campaign reflects a fundamental lack of respect for court
  proceedings, and either indicates an attempt by your client to influence media
  coverage through assertions which she cannot evidence, or is reflective of a
  serious breach of her duty of candour in these proceedings … “The proper place
  for your client to advance her case is in court. Your client’s approach in
  relation to briefing the media with a wholly different basis for proscription
  is entirely improper and a breach of her duty to the court. If your client has
  evidence to support her assertions, this ought to have been disclosed. As she
  has not, she must cease her misleading campaign immediately.” Last month,
  Palestine Action became the first direct action group to be proscribed,
  placing it alongside the likes of Islamic State and National Action. This
  week, Amnesty International UK and Liberty were granted permission to
  intervene in the judicial review, which is expected to be heard in November.
  The government has been approached for comment.
