  Atomic 9pm, Sky Atlantic More full-throttle action with Max (Alfie Allen) and
  JJ (Shazad Latif) as they are ordered by the cartel to transport the uranium
  through Syria. But the unlikely new partners in crime each have secrets: Max
  has been told his girlfriend’s life is at risk if he doesn’t deliver; and
  Syria holds a lot of troubling family memories for the mysterious JJ.
  Meanwhile, Samira Wiley’s CIA officer, Cassie, is hot on their tail. Hollie
  Richardson The Dog House 8pm, Channel 4 Mushy the Maltese cross, Fox the
  fluffy pomeranian and Narla the blind boxer are all looking for new owners in
  the most heartwarming animal show on telly. Who will go home with the Rev Alex
  and Carrie to fill their empty nest? HR The Hotel Inspector 8pm, Channel 5 To
  the heart of the Forest of Dean, where eccentric pub landlord Phil’s obsession
  with pies is putting a crimp on his holiday accommodation business. Bright of
  eye and floral of blouse, Alex Polizzi breezes in with simple fixes to turn
  crappy into chic. The first things to go: the large colour photographs of pies
  above every bed. Jack Seale Tonight: How to Keep Your Money Safe? 8.30pm, ITV1
  With a lack of curricular financial education and so many ways of losing money
  through bad decisions, scams and factors beyond our control, no wonder
  millions of people in the UK say they have no confidence with money. Ruth
  Dodsworth finds out how we can protect ourselves. HR Ben Fogle: New Lives in
  the Wild 9pm, Channel 5 It’s an unusually comfy billet for Fogle this week:
  former corporate exec Yidan has spent the last four years turning her patch of
  remote farmland in northern Thailand into a homely retreat. Between mucking in
  with chores and chasing chickens, he hears why the 34-year-old from China saw
  the pandemic as an opportunity to start anew. Graeme Virtue Night Coppers 9pm,
  More4 Even in apparently genteel Brighton, things get lively after dark. This
  series rides shotgun with the city’s night patrol, which in this episode
  demonstrates a combination of sensitivity and toughness. On the one hand, they
  deal carefully with a potential suicide. But there’s also a manhunt in the
  aftermath of a crowbar attack. Phil Harrison Film choice The Fisher King
  (Terry Gilliam, 1991), 3.05pm, Sky Cinema Greats Terry Gilliam’s most romantic
  drama may well be his best. After New York radio shock jock Jack (Jeff
  Bridges) inspires a mass shooting, his life falls apart. Then he meets Parry
  (Robin Williams), a mentally ill down-and-out on a quest for the holy grail –
  and the heart of the klutzy Lydia (Amanda Plummer). Because Parry’s wife was
  killed in the massacre, Jack seeks redemption by helping him with both wishes.
  Comedy and fantasy mingle delightfully, while Mercedes Ruehl is on
  Oscar-winning form as Jack’s long-suffering girlfriend. Simon Wardell Rebecca
  (Alfred Hitchcock, 1940), 4.30pm, Talking Pictures TV Joan Fontaine delivers a
  perfectly calibrated rabbit-in-the-headlights performance in Alfred
  Hitchcock’s first US film, a fervid adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s gothic
  mystery. A whirlwind romance with the brooding Maxim (Laurence Olivier)
  doesn’t prepare the second Mrs de Winter (Fontaine) for life at his Cornish
  stately pile, Manderley, where the memory of his drowned wife is sustained by
  the forbidding, fetishistic housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson). SW
  Reality (Tina Satter, 2023), 9pm, Film4 A verbatim dramatisation of an FBI
  interview doesn’t sound like a ripsnorter, but Tina Satter’s 2023
  ripped-from-the-headlines drama is genuinely gripping. National Security
  Agency linguist Reality Winner (Sydney Sweeney) comes home to be faced by
  federal agents – led by Josh Hamilton’s Garrick and Marchánt Davis’s Taylor –
  who want to talk to her about the leak of classified information about Russian
  interference in US elections. Redacted dialogue is represented imaginatively
  by characters simply vanishing, but it is Sweeney’s gradual disintegration in
  the face of the evidence that is the most compelling. SW Live sport
  International football, Kazakhstan v Wales, 2.45pm, BBC One A World Cup
  qualifier. Followed by Luxembourg v Northern Ireland at 7.30pm on BBC Three.
