  Mexico has expelled 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the US in the latest
  major deal with the Trump administration as US authorities ratchet up pressure
  on criminal networks sending drugs across the border. Authorities sent 26
  prisoners who were wanted in the US for ties to drug-trafficking groups,
  Mexico’s attorney general’s office and security ministry said in a joint
  statement on Tuesday. The transfers were carried out after a promise from the
  US justice department that prosecutors would not seek the death penalty in any
  of the cases. Those being handed over to US custody include Abigael González
  Valencia, a leader of “Los Cuinis” a group closely aligned with notorious
  Jalisco New Generation cartel or CJNG. Another person, Roberto Salazar, is
  accused of participating in the 2008 killing of a Los Angeles county sheriff’s
  deputy, the person said. It marked the second time in months Mexico had
  expelled cartel figures accused of narcotics smuggling, murder and other
  crimes amid mounting pressure from the Trump administration to curb the flow
  of drugs across the border. In February, Mexico handed over to US authorities
  29 cartel figures, including drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, who was behind
  the killing of a US DEA agent in 1985. Those transfers came days before 25%
  tariffs on Mexican imports were to take effect. Late last month, Donald Trump
  spoke with Mexico president Claudia Sheinbaum and agreed to put off threatened
  30% tariffs for another 90 days to allow for negotiations. Sheinbaum has shown
  a willingness to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically
  being more aggressive in pursuit of Mexico’s cartels. But she has drawn a
  clear line when it comes to Mexico’s sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by
  Trump and others of intervention by the US military. The Trump administration
  made dismantling dangerous drug cartels a key priority, designating CJNG and
  seven other Latin American organized crime groups foreign terrorist
  organizations. González Valencia is the brother-in-law of CJNG leader Nemesio
  Rubén “El Mencho” Oseguera Cervantes, a top target of the the US government.
  He was arrested in February 2015 in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, and had been
  fighting extradition to the US since then. Alongside his two brothers, he led
  “Los Cuinis”, which financed the the founding and growth of the CJNG, one of
  the most powerful and dangerous cartels in Mexico. CJNG traffics hundreds of
  tons of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl into the US and other countries
  and is known for extreme violence, murders, torture and corruption. One of his
  brothers, José González Valencia, was sentenced in Washington’s federal court
  in June to 30 years in a US prison after pleading guilty to international
  cocaine trafficking. Jose González Valencia was arrested in 2017 under the
  first Trump administration at a beach resort in Brazil while vacationing with
  his family under a fake name.
