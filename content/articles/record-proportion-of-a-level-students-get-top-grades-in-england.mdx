  Students in England gained record levels of top grades in this year’s A-level
  exams, driven by young men producing their strongest performances outside the
  pandemic years. Ofqual, the exam regulator for England, shrugged off any
  suggestions of grade inflation, pointing to the lower proportion of
  18-year-olds taking A-levels and saying that fewer low-achieving students had
  entered. Despite the overall improvement, regional variations remain, with
  students in the West Midlands and north-east England recording lower grades
  overall than in 2024. The north-east remains the only region of England with
  average grades below pre-pandemic levels. Among the more than 1.1m entries in
  England, 28.2% gained an A or A* grade, while 9.4% gained the top A* grade,
  both higher than in 2024 when 27.6% of entries got A and A*s and 9.3% gained
  A*s. In 2019, before the pandemic, 25.2% of entries received top grades.
  Across all students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, 28.3% of entries
  were awarded an A or A* grade, up by 0.5 percentage points on last year. Wales
  was the only country of the three to see a drop in the proportion of top
  grades awarded compared with last year, falling from 29.9% to 29.5%. Other
  than in 2020, 2021 and 2022, when awards were affected by changes to
  assessments caused by Covid-19, the proportion of top grades in England was
  higher than any year since the A* grade was introduced in 2010, and before
  that going back to 2001. Ian Bauckham, Ofqual’s chief regulator responsible
  for overseeing England’s results, said: “Standards have been maintained for
  another year, with grades determined by students’ performance in exams using
  exam boards’ strict marking and grading processes.” Bauckham noted that the
  number of entries were down compared with last year, despite the increased
  numbers of 18-year-olds in the population, and said a “smaller, smarter
  cohort” was taking A-levels this year. “We can be absolutely confident that
  the standard of work required to get any grade at A-level is the same this
  year as it was last year, and as it was in 2023,” he said after results were
  announced. “Of course different students entering for exams and undertaking
  their qualifications will mean that outcomes will vary from year to year. This
  year we see some significant cohort differences. The cohort is slightly
  smaller and slightly stronger in terms of its attainment when it started
  A-levels that it has been for the past few years. “And it’s not surprising,
  given that the grading standard stays the same, that different students,
  slightly stronger students, will achieve very fractionally higher outcomes,
  and that’s what we’re seeing playing out this year.” Young men outpaced young
  women in the proportion of entries with the two top grades, with 28.4%
  compared with 28% for women in England, reversing the positions of previous
  years. The improved performance – which belies recent complaints of boys being
  “left behind” by the school system – was more extreme among 18-year-olds,
  where 9.9% of entries by male students gained A*s compared with 9.1% for
  female students. Experts cautioned, however, that many more female students
  took A-levels than male students, with nearly 440,000 entries from the former
  this year, compared with fewer than 380,000 from the latter. Male students
  were more concentrated in subjects such as maths, physics and economics, where
  they tended to do well. Maths remained the most popular A-level this year, up
  by more than 4% to 112,000 entries. But only 37% of entries were from female
  students. Subjects such as economics, meanwhile, have overtaken academic
  mainstays such as history. The director of regulation and compliance at the
  AQA exam board, Claire Thomson, said the popularity of social media
  influencers could explain some of the increases in entries for economics and
  business studies. “They’re clearly relevant for lots of career opportunities,
  whether it’s finance, marketing or management. I also wonder if there’s a
  little bit about the social media phenomenon these days and the amount of
  influencers people see making what seems like lots of money,” she said. The
  gap between the highest- and lowest-performing regions widened further, with
  32.1% of entries in London gaining A* or A, compared with 22.9% in north-east
  England. The chief executive of the OCR examination board, Jill Duffy, said:
  “Regional inequalities are getting worse, not better. The gap at top grades
  [A* or A] has grown again. London is once again the top-performing region and
  is now 9.2 percentage points ahead of the north-east. “The north-east is the
  only region in England where the proportion of A* and A grades is down on both
  last year and 2019. The picture is slightly brighter at A*-C, with a smaller
  gap between regions. These regional inequalities need more attention.” The
  Ucas university admissions administrator said record numbers of 18-year-olds
  in the UK got a place at university or college for this autumn. The A-level,
  BTec and T-level results showed 255,130 had been accepted, compared to 243,650
  in 2024, a rise of 4.7%.
