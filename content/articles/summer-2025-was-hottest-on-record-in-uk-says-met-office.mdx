  The UK has had its hottest summer on record, the Met Office has said, after
  the country faced four heatwaves in a single season. The mean temperature for
  meteorological summer, which encompasses the months of June, July and August,
  was 16.1C (60.98F), which is significantly above the current record of 15.76C
  set in 2018. All five of the hottest summers on record have now occurred since
  2000 – a clear signal of the global heating that scientists say is resulting
  from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The Met
  Office said it had conducted a rapid analysis that found the record-breaking
  summer temperatures had been made about 70 times more likely because of
  human-induced climate change. Dr Mark McCarthy, the agency’s head of climate
  attribution, said: “In a natural climate, we could expect to see a summer like
  2025 with an approximate return period of around 340 years, while in the
  current climate we could expect to see these sorts of summers roughly one in
  every five years. “Our analysis suggests that while 2025 has set a new record,
  we could plausibly experience much hotter summers in our current and
  near-future climate and shows how what would have been seen as extremes in the
  past are becoming more common in our changing climate.” The latest record
  beats the last by a wide margin. This year’s average temperature was just over
  a third of a degree hotter than 2018’s previous record, while temperatures for
  the other four of the five hottest summers on record differed by just
  hundredths of a degree. Overall the mean temperature was 1.51C above the
  long-term meteorological average. June and July had hot weather, with four
  heatwaves including days above 30C. There has been very little rain across
  much of the country, with England experiencing what the government has called
  “nationally significant” water shortfalls. Much of England is under a hosepipe
  ban as reservoirs, rivers and groundwater run dry. Although the summer has
  been consistently warm, there has not been extreme heat. The highest
  temperature recorded to date for 2025 was 35.8C in Faversham, Kent, on 1 July,
  well short of the UK’s all-time high of 40.3C, set in July 2022. But in June
  alone there were two heatwaves, making it the hottest June on record for
  England and the second hottest for the UK overall. A third heatwave in July
  and a fourth in August pushed the overall average temperature for the summer
  into record-breaking territory. Towards the end of June, scientists calculated
  that the heat endured by people in the south-east of England had been made 100
  times more likely by the climate crisis. Meteorologists have said this year’s
  consistent warmth was driven by dry ground from spring, high-pressure systems,
  and unusually warm seas around the UK, and minimum temperatures had been
  exceptionally above average. The Met Office scientist Dr Emily Carlisle said:
  “These conditions have created an environment where heat builds quickly and
  lingers, with both maximum and minimum temperatures considerably above
  average,.”
