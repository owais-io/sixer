  Two Palestinian Australian men say they were subjected to racist abuse on a
  Sydney train on the same day anti-immigration marches took place across
  Australian cities. Film-makers Shamikh and Majed Badra told Guardian Australia
  they were verbally abused on a train on Sunday afternoon, allegedly because
  Majed was wearing a keffiyeh. The brothers, who have had family killed in the
  war in Gaza and whose surviving family members in the occupied territory
  remain under bombardment, had attended a rally for Palestine in Sydney’s CBD,
  before boarding a train at Town Hall for Stanmore station. The pair sat
  together on the lower deck of the train: Majed Badra wore a black-and-white
  keffiyeh, a garment not unique to, but strongly associated with, the
  Palestinian cause. Within minutes, the pair claim they were subjected to
  unprompted verbal abuse from men on the train. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  “They were behind us, so we didn’t see them to begin with,” Shamikh Badra
  alleged. “But they just started abusing Majed, telling him to ‘take off your
  scarf’.” Video of the incident shows the altercation and abuse escalating: “If
  you want to fight for Palestine, go back there.” “Get the fuck out of here. We
  don’t want you in our country.” “We don’t want you here. Fuck off.” “You want
  to get free money, you fucking loser cunt.” The footage shows several of the
  men verbally lashing out in a threatening manner. At one point, an
  unidentified person off-screen shouts what sounds like a racial slur at one of
  the brothers: “Look at you, you monkey.” Shamikh, a PhD student, said he
  initially tried to de-escalate the situation, urging the assailants to “sit
  down and we can talk”. But the tirade of abuse and threats continued, he said.
  “I tried to stop this escalation, I tried to protect Majed but they kept
  trying to attack Majed and attack me physically – we tried to protect
  ourselves as best I can.” Shamikh said they felt forced from their seats to
  the train station doors. In the video he responds shouting “racists” at the
  men and free Palestine. Shamikh told Guardian Australia he understood the
  risks of speaking out about the attack but that he would not be cowed in the
  face of racism. “They were so hostile towards us,” he said. “I looked at them
  and I couldn’t understand: why are they so aggressive? Why are they so angry?
  I have never seen these people before in my life – why do they hate us like
  that? “This was an attack on our identity. Everyone has the right to be proud
  about their identity, their family, their history. We didn’t do anything. “No
  one should feel unsafe because of who they are. And we should not be silent
  about this.” The train was halted at Macdonaldtown station and all passengers
  ordered off. The Badra brothers reported the incident to police, providing
  video footage of the abuse. A NSW police spokesperson said that
  “investigations into the incident are continuing”. A Sydney Trains
  spokesperson said: “NSW police are investigating the matter and Sydney Trains
  security will assist that investigation”. It’s not known if the alleged
  abusers on board the train had attended the anti-immigration rally which also
  marched in Sydney on Sunday afternoon. ‘March for Australia’ protests Police
  estimated 15,000 people joined the so-called March for Australia: protesters
  chanted “send them back”, while members of the neo-Nazi National Socialist
  Network handed out leaflets saying “white Australia must organise” and led
  chants of “heil Australia”. “If you go to a rally and the Nazis turn up, it’s
  not one you should be at,” the New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said on
  Monday, “and no one can deny that they were there. No one can deny that racist
  language was used.” Twelve people were arrested following Victoria’s
  anti-immigration march, attended by about 5,000 people. An Indigenous camp in
  the Kings Domain was also stormed by neo-Nazis. On Tuesday morning, the
  self-proclaimed neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell crashed a press conference held by the
  Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, yelling “you’re a coward and we’re going to
  take this country back”. Allan later responded she would not be intimidated by
  Nazi “goons”. Shamikh and Majed are Palestinian Australian film-makers who
  produced a documentary, Gaza Nippers, about a surf lifesaving program for
  children in Gaza, supported by Australian surf clubs. The Gaza surf club has
  been forced to suspend its operations. At least seven nippers and club
  supporters have been killed in the the current war.
