  Over 11km of coast from Grange to West beach, teams from the City of Charles
  Sturt fill bags with dead fish and animals that will end up as compost,
  collecting between 40kg and 200kg in a single day. They arrive before dawn and
  the daily walkers and their dogs, working to make the afflicted beaches more
  pleasant. Sometimes, community members make life easier in turn by taking it
  upon themselves to sort the carcasses into neat piles for them to collect. “We
  started doing it because we felt we needed to just get it off the beach,”
  coordinator of parks and biodiversity, Tyron Bennetts, says. As the scale of
  the bloom became clear, they started cataloguing and weighing what they picked
  up each day. SA’s algal bloom probably started in January, and, over months,
  has grown to more than 4,500 sq km. By March, surfers complained of a
  mysterious sea foam, along with irritated eyes and hacking coughs. The algae
  species responsible was identified as Karenia mikimotoi. By July it had hit
  metropolitan beaches: suddenly many more people were witnessing the foam, the
  piles of seaweed as kelp died off, and the animal deaths. Karenia mikimotoi is
  not toxic to humans, although it can cause eye, nose and throat irritation.
  But it has proved catastrophic for fish and marine animals. The iNaturalist
  site has logged about 34,000 dead animals from about 480 different species.
  “We don’t see it stopping anytime soon,” Bennetts says. Satellite imagery has
  shown the bloom continuing to “pulsate”, dashing hopes that winter would see
  it off. Charles Sturt and other local councils will share in funding clean-up
  operations through a joint state and federal $28m package. Bennetts’ team
  rotates clean-up duty to give people a break from the grim pickings. “It would
  be a bit much to keep collecting the dead marine life,” he says. “It’s been a
  difficult time for everyone – particularly the community – but the team have
  handled themselves extremely well given the circumstances. “There has been
  some pretty distraught community members. We’ve encouraged the team to have
  the conversation with them, see how they’re feeling.” The death toll may be
  limited to marine life, but the human mental health toll is building. Dr
  Brianna Le Busque, an environmental science and psychology researcher from the
  University of South Australia, has surveyed about 650 people to study the
  “ecoanxiety” caused by the bloom. She and fellow researcher professor Carla
  Litchfield are still analysing the data. But she says they have witnessed
  people’s extreme anxiety about “seeing the fish wash up on their beloved
  beaches”. “One person in particular said it was like seeing the death of a
  loved one,” she says. And there’s a double whammy. “A lot of people go
  surfing, go for a walk, go diving or fishing as a way of minimising distress,”
  Le Busque says – but now, the beach is the thing that distresses them. A
  parliamentary inquiry into the algal bloom, its causes, impacts and
  management, is due to report in October. In its submission, the Australian Red
  Cross notes that the bloom is “not easy or simple to categorise in ‘disaster’
  terminology”. “It has elements of a protracted or slow-onset disaster (no
  defined start or end, uncertainty around scale, scope, response, declaration
  and impact),” its submission says. “It has elements of a collective trauma
  event (public witnessing of death and harm, high horror element, media
  exposure).” The Red Cross notes the climate-induced event “bears some
  resemblance to an agricultural disaster or disease outbreak”. It says if the
  psychosocial effects go unaddressed, that could amplify and prolong the harm,
  and recommends necessary investment to “facilitate a fast and just recovery”.
  The science says the bloom was caused by an ongoing marine heatwave, a
  phenomenon likely to become more common with global heating, as well as
  nutrients in the water from the 2022-23 Murray-Darling Basin floods and an
  “upwelling” of colder water towards the surface. But there are still many
  unknowns. John Hulmes, part of the council’s beach maintenance crew, talks
  about the bloom’s unpredictability, of not knowing what will wash up, how
  much, and where. “When we first started, doing weekend work, we were pretty
  much only getting Port Jackson sharks and rays,” Hulmes says. “Then you
  started getting smaller fish …” The philosophy of the council workers is, “If
  you know the information, give the information,” says beach, biodiversity and
  mowing group leader, Evan Woods. “If you don’t know the information, say you
  don’t know … but we can endeavour to find out.” One silver lining in the
  crisis, Le Brusque says, is the community response in the face of “practical
  anxiety”. Ecologist Faith Coleman, who has become a leading voice on the
  bloom, agrees. Her submission to the inquiry says while state and governments
  have been slow to respond, the community has given her hope. “The
  socioeconomic impacts of this bloom have been extensive; however, the
  community’s response to this bloom has been heartening,” she says. “Individual
  and community concern regarding the impacts on our precious marine ecosystems,
  along with our community’s willingness to learn and change in an attempt to
  protect this key aspect of SA’s identity and sense of self, has given me hope
  that there is the political will and willingness to address the twin [crises]
  of climate change and biodiversity loss, at a state and national level.” Amid
  the cold, foam and gathering clouds, Grange local Jackson Miller is one of the
  few braving the water. He and friend Charlton Gunn are sanguine, both about
  the bloom and the temperature. “It’s just beautiful to start the day with
  something challenging,” Miller says.
