webTitle: ' Obesity has a serious impact on health – it shortened my mum’s life | Letter'

  With reference to the letters on Rose Stokes’ article (I thought we’d entered
  the age of body positivity. Then came ‘shrinking girl summer’ – is everyone
  getting smaller except me?, 10 August), I would like to add a personal view.
  My lovely mom was overweight all of her adult life – between 17 stone and 18
  stone. She could never run around and play with us children. In her 40s she
  developed diabetes and high blood pressure. Many DVTs and pulmonary embolisms
  followed. She died of a coronary aged 62. We should all live without fear of
  stigma and ridicule. This doesn’t mean that we should make choices that
  shorten our lives or encourage others to do so. Being overweight brings health
  risks. Blaming the patriarchy, fatphobia or big pharma doesn’t reduce those
  risks. My lovely dad – who was never overweight – died at the age of 93. In my
  mind, I lost a third of the time I might have had with my mom, a loss I put
  squarely down to obesity. I worry increasingly for our young people – men and
  women – where being overweight is becoming normalised. Sadly, in my small town
  in south-west England, the idea that “everyone is getting smaller” is
  demonstrably untrue. Frances Knight Devon
