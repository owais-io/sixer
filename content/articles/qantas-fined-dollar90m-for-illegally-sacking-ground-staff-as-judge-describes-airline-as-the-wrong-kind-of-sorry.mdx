  Qantas has been fined a record $90m for illegally firing 1,820 baggage
  handlers and other ground staff in 2020, taking the cost of its controversial
  outsourcing decision to more than $200m. Justice Michael Lee on Monday handed
  down his decision on the penalty, nine months after Qantas and the Transport
  Workers’ Union agreed the airline would pay $120m in compensation to the
  sacked workers. Reading his judgment in the federal court in Sydney, Lee said
  the $90m penalty was “slightly less than 75% of the maximum penalty”, and that
  $50m of the penalty would go to the TWU. Lee said allocating a significant
  proportion of the fine would incentivise unions to pursue potential breaches
  of the enhance the Fair Work Act when the federal ombudsman failed to act, as
  he said it had in the case of Qantas. “It will send a message to Qantas and
  other well-resourced employers that not only will they face potentially
  significant penalties for the breach of the act, but those penalties will be
  provided to trade unions to resource [them] to fulfil their statutory roles as
  enforcers of the act,” he said. Lee reserved his decision on who should
  receive the other $40m. He described the lengthy legal battle between the TWU
  and Qantas as “no ordinary case” and said he had “hesitation in reaching a
  conclusion” as to whether Qantas was “truly contrite or rather engaging in
  performative remorse”. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I do think persons of
  responsibility within Qantas do now have some genuine regrets but this more
  likely reflects the damage this case has done to the company, rather than a
  remorse for the damage done to the affected workers,” Lee said. Lee said he
  felt a “sense of disquiet and uncertainty as to precisely what went on within
  the upper echelons of Qantas leading up to the outsourcing decision” and
  described the airline as “the wrong kind of sorry”. Among the reasons Lee gave
  for imposing the record penalty was the airline’s attempts to obscure the
  decision-making process behind the outsourcing and the role the then chief
  executive officer, Alan Joyce, had played. Lee was also critical of the way
  Qantas handled the legal process, saying its public relations department had
  rushed to send out press releases “spinning” court decisions in the airline’s
  favour. He criticised the decision not to have Vanessa Hudson, the airline’s
  former chief financial officer and now chief executive, testify in court. Lee
  said her evidence would have helped him assess whether the airline’s
  “expressions of contrition” and its promises of cultural change were genuine.
  After the decision, Hudson said the outsourcing decision had “caused genuine
  hardship” for the affected people. “We sincerely apologise to each and every
  one of the 1,820 ground handling employees and to their families who suffered
  as a result,” she said. “Over the past 18 months we’ve worked hard to change
  the way we operate … This remains our highest priority as we work to earn back
  the trust we lost.” The $90m penalty will be paid in accordance with the
  orders of the court. Qantas has also paid $120m into the compensation fund for
  all affected former employees, which is being administered by Maurice
  Blackburn. The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said the union had won a
  “David and Goliath” battle and secured “the most significant industrial
  outcome in Australia’s history”. Addressing the media, Kaine would not be
  drawn on how the TWU would spend its $50m windfall other than to suggest it
  would be used for other industrial campaigns representing its members. “We
  will keep fighting our industrial fights,” he said. Kaine said the TWU would
  submit to the court that the unallocated $40m of the $90m fine should go
  towards additional support for the affected workers. Sacked workers still
  struggling Anne Guirguis, who cleaned international aircraft for Qantas until
  the airline sacked her in 2020, told journalists she felt “relief” over the
  penalty decision. But she said she and many of her former colleagues had not
  been able to find new jobs. “All over the age of 50, it is impossible,” she
  said. Standing beside her, Don Dixon, who had been a Qantas baggage handler,
  said he hoped the airline would learn from this and change the way it treated
  its staff. “It is difficult getting a job at our age now, most people are 60
  or above,” he said. “To be retrained at this time in your life and go to an
  employer and say ‘I was 20 years plus working for formerly the greatest
  company in this country … I service an aircraft, do you happen to have a
  plane?’” The TWU had sought the maximum penalty of $121m, while Qantas had
  urged Lee to impose a “mid-range” penalty of between $40m and $80m. Josh
  Bornstein, the Maurice Blackburn principal lawyer who represented the TWU in
  court, described Qantas as the country’s “fiercest legal opponent” and said
  the $90m penalty was the largest in Australia’s corporate history. “It is also
  perhaps the darkest day in Qantas’s 105-year history,” he said. The penalty
  decision comes about nine months after Qantas and the TWU agreed on a $120m
  payout for the sacked workers. While the true cost of the illegal outsourcing
  has far eclipsed the $70m Qantas had previously budgeted to cover it, the saga
  does not appear to have put a serious dent in the carrier’s profits. Qantas,
  which is due to release its financial results for the past year on 28 August,
  in February reported a bumper $1.39b in pre-tax profit for the six months
  between July and December last year. In 2024, Qantas posted a $2.1b annual
  underlying profit. In 2023, the airline delivered a record $2.47b profit as it
  emerged from the pandemic era. In 2019, the year before it illegally sacked
  1,820 staff, the airline made $1.30b in pre-tax profit. The penalty decision
  wraps up a five-year legal battle that began when the TWU took the airline to
  court, arguing that the outsourcing was unlawful and motivated by the fact
  that many of the affected workers were union members with stronger bargaining
  power. The federal court ruled in favour of the TWU and found the outsourcing
  contravened the Fair Work Act. Qantas appealed against the decision to the
  full bench of the federal court and later the high court – both of which were
  unsuccessful. After the appeal, the two parties spent more than a year in
  mediation and remedy hearings to determine how much Qantas would have to pay
  the outsourced workers for economic losses linked to lost wages. ‘A ruthless,
  calculated act’ The New South Wales Labor senator Tony Sheldon, a former TWU
  national secretary and longtime Qantas adversary, said the $90m penalty
  against the airline confirmed workers had been “sacked in a ruthless,
  calculated act of corporate cost-cutting”. Qantas said it accepted the federal
  court’s decision and would pay the $90m penalty according to the court’s
  orders. Last year Qantas agreed to a civil penalty of $100m and $20m in
  compensation for allegedly selling tens of thousands of tickets on flights
  that had already been cancelled. • This article was amended on 18 August 2025.
  Justice Michael Lee referred to the $90m penalty as being “slightly less than
  75% of the maximum penalty”, not “slightly less than 75% off the maximum
  penalty” as an earlier version said.
