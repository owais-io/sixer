  Cancer cases are projected to surge in England by 2040, with a person
  diagnosed every two minutes, up from one every four minutes in the 1970s. More
  than 6 million new cases of the disease are predicted to be diagnosed over the
  next 15 years, with the NHS at risk of being unable to cope unless action is
  taken to prevent more cases and diagnose the disease earlier, when it is more
  treatable. One Cancer Voice, the coalition of 60 cancer charities that
  published the projections on Tuesday, called on ministers to set early
  diagnosis targets and introduce strong prevention policies to save lives and
  transform cancer outcomes. The projected increase in cases is likely to be due
  to a range of factors, including a rapidly expanding and ageing population,
  improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk
  factors for the disease. There have been 5.5 million cases in the last 15
  years, the analysis says. There will be a 14.2% increase in the next 15 years,
  with 6.3 million cancer cases expected by 2040. Regionally, the south-east
  could have the biggest rise in diagnoses, with more than 1 million cases
  between now and 2040, the study suggests. This is followed by the north-west,
  with 865,000 cases, the east of England and the south-west with 722,000, and
  London with 714,000. The analysis also found that cases of common cancers are
  expected to reach record highs. Between now and 2040, there will be 1,050,000
  cases of prostate cancer diagnosed, as well as 906,000 cases of breast cancer
  and 821,000 cases of lung cancer, according to the coalition. Despite progress
  in survival – which has doubled since the 1970s – the surge in cases threatens
  to pile pressure on an already overstretched NHS. Without decisive action,
  England risks falling behind comparable countries in cancer outcomes, the
  analysis warns. The projections come after the Department of Health and Social
  Care launched a call in February for evidence to help shape a national cancer
  plan. Michelle Mitchell, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK and a One
  Cancer Voice representative, said: “Nearly one in two of us will be diagnosed
  with cancer in our lifetime – everyone will be impacted by the disease,
  whether they receive a diagnosis themselves, or have a friend, family member
  or loved one who does. “The national cancer plan for England could be a
  defining moment. If the UK government delivers an ambitious, fully funded
  strategy, we could save more lives and transform cancer outcomes, propelling
  England from world-lagging to among world-leading when it comes to tackling
  this disease. “We’ve seen progress before – now is the time to act again and
  make a difference for cancer patients.” The coalition is calling on ministers
  to meet six “tests” to make England a world-leader in cancer care. They are: A
  pledge to meet all cancer waiting times by the end of parliament in 2029. A
  new earlier diagnosis target, with improved screening programmes. The
  introduction of strong cancer prevention policies. Addressing inequalities in
  patient care. Improving access to clinical trials for cancer patients. Better
  support for people to live well with and beyond cancer. A Department of Health
  and Social Care spokesperson said: “This government is prioritising cancer
  care as we turn around more than a decade of neglect of our NHS. “We’re
  already making an impact, with 95,000 more people having cancer diagnosed or
  ruled out within 28 days between July 2024 and May 2025, compared to the same
  period the previous year. This will soon be supported by our new national
  cancer plan, setting out how cancer care will improve over the coming years.
  “We’re also making it easier for people to get tests, checks and scans with
  DIY screening kits for cervical cancer, new radiotherapy machines in every
  region, and by creating the first smoke-free generation.”
