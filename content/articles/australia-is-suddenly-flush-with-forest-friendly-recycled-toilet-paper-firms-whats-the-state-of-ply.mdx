  The Australian brand Who Gives a Crap (WGAC) has recently launched its toilet
  paper products in the UK supermarket chain Tesco. Having begun as a home
  delivery service, its recycled and “sustainable” products are now stocked in
  Woolworths, Aldi and independent supermarkets such as IGA in Australia.
  Despite the growing presence of WGAC and other brands offering recycled
  products, the supermarket shelves remain dominated by plush, virgin-pulp
  toilet paper. So what are the prospects for further changes in the market? And
  what are the ethical and environmental options for consumers? Is recycled
  toilet paper better for the environment? Most mainstream toilet paper is made
  from virgin pulp – wood fibre sourced from hardwood tree plantations. “They’re
  grown for single-use products, without any environmental benefit,” says
  Jennifer Macklin, a senior research fellow at Monash University’s Sustainable
  Development Institute. “Recycled paper uses less energy and water to produce
  than virgin or bamboo products,” Macklin says. The head of sustainability at
  WGAC, Elissa Foster, says globally more than 1m trees are cut down each day to
  produce traditional toilet paper, citing 2022 research from Edge Environment,
  commissioned by the organisation. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Planting
  trees for low-value products such as toilet paper in place of old-growth
  forests contributes to the loss of habitat for species such as the
  yellow-tailed black-cockatoo, says Estelle Van Hoeydonck, a conservation
  campaigner at Zoos Victoria, which runs the Wipe for Wildlife campaign.
  “Opting for recycled toilet paper is one tangible action Australians can take
  to support wildlife,” she says. Recycled toilet paper is made from
  post-consumer waste paper, diverting material from landfill, reducing demand
  for virgin pulp and supporting a circular economy, Foster says. Encore Tissue,
  an Australian company that produces the icare brand, was featured on Dr Karl’s
  How Things Work earlier this year. It estimates its recycling operations save
  138,000 trees, 185 gigawatt hours of electricity and 128,000 litres of water a
  year. But Macklin says it is just one part of the wider picture. “Recycled
  toilet paper is a positive option when feasible – but we don’t want people to
  feel guilty. Choices like reducing food waste have far greater environmental
  value than switching toilet paper brands.” What about bamboo – how sustainable
  is that? Bamboo is often marketed as an eco-friendly alternative – including
  by WGAC – because it grows rapidly, reaching maturity in three to five years
  compared with 10 to 40 years for other trees commonly harvested, Foster says.
  She says it is “a great alternative to wood-based paper”, but agrees with
  independent experts that recycled paper is the more sustainable option.
  “Bamboo is a substitution strategy,” Macklin says, “less preferable than
  reusing existing materials.” Nevertheless, Macklin says she chooses bamboo for
  my household. “After testing several options, that was the compromise that
  worked for us.” One reason is that recycled toilet paper is still not as soft
  as virgin or bamboo. It may also disintegrate less effectively, affecting
  plumbing. The consumer advocacy group Choice warned in its 2025 toilet paper
  review that some recycled brands did not break down quickly enough. Is demand
  for recycled products growing? Yes – for both online and in-store brands. WGAC
  reported a 21% year-on-year growth in Woolworths over the past 12 months, with
  rising interest beyond early adopters. The icare products, which are sold
  exclusively through supermarkets, have also consistently increased sales over
  the past few years. Experts agree that the more consumers embrace recycled
  options, the more likely it is supermarkets will expand their ranges. But
  availability is still patchy. Woolworths carries several recycled brands,
  including from WGAC, icare, Naturale and Emotions (online only). Coles lists
  just one icare product. Aldi does not stock recycled toilet paper year-round
  but has sold limited editions of WGAC products. Foster says WGAC has helped
  raise awareness and meet demand for recycled toilet paper in a more convenient
  way. “We witnessed this demand rise in 2020 due to #toiletpapergate [the panic
  buying spree when Covid hit].” An icare spokesperson said WGAC’s rise had not
  negatively affected its shelf presence. “We try to match pack sizes, quality
  and prices with non-sustainable brands like Quilton or Kleenex.” Other
  home-delivery startups like Yarn’n, Oo Bamboo, About a Dog and Emotions, have
  followed similar models, often linking each purchase to a 50% charitable
  donation.
