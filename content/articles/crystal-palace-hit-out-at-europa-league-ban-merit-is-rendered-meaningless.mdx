  Crystal Palace have called on Uefa to scrap its rules on multi-club ownership
  (MCO) and questioned whether they received a fair hearing at the court of
  arbitration of sport after their appeal against demotion from the Europa
  League was rejected. Cas confirmed on Monday it had upheld Uefa’s decision to
  demote the FA Cup winners to the Conference League after it decided John
  Textor held shares and had a decisive influence in Palace and Lyon, who also
  qualified for the Europa League. Textor has since sold his 44.9% stake in the
  club to another US businessman, Woody Johnson. Palace, who are expected to
  miss out on up to £20m in extra revenue as a result, confirmed in a strongly
  worded statement they would take their place in the Conference League – in
  which they will face Norway’s Fredrikstad or Midtjylland of Denmark in a
  playoff this month – as they continue to take legal advice on whether to make
  a claim against Uefa for compensation. Palace described the decision to punish
  them as evidence that “sporting merit is rendered meaningless” and claimed
  that “certain clubs, organisations and individuals have a unique privilege and
  power”. “This growing and unhealthy influence has shattered the hopes and
  dreams of Crystal Palace supporters and does not bode well for aspirational
  teams all over Europe competing to progress when rules and sanctions are
  unevenly applied in the most flagrant way,” Palace said. “Multi-club
  structures hide behind the charade of a ‘blind trust’ while clubs such as
  ours, who have no connection to another club whatsoever, are prevented from
  playing in the same competition. “To compound the injustice, clubs that appear
  to have huge informal arrangements with each other are also allowed to
  participate and even possibly play against each other.” Several clubs who are
  part of MCOs have been able to place their ownership in blind trusts to
  circumvent Uefa’s regulations, although Palace missed the original 1 March
  deadline to do so. They are believed to have presented evidence to Cas that
  only members of the European Club Association (ECA) were informed the deadline
  could be extended until 31 May. That argument was rejected by the Cas panel,
  which said that Uefa’s regulations were clear “and do not provide flexibility
  to clubs that are noncompliant on the assessment date”. The regulations were
  updated last year to allow clubs who are part of MCOs to compete in different
  Uefa competitions, but Palace believe further changes are needed from European
  football’s governing body. “A combination of poorly conceived regulations and
  their unequal application means our brilliant fans will be deprived of the
  chance to watch this team compete in the Europa League for the first time in
  our history,” they said. “This should be a turning point for football. Uefa
  must fulfil its mandate to pass coherent rules which are properly communicated
  and applied, with reasonable cure periods to resolve uncertainty and
  consistent sanctions, treating all clubs equally with a proper appeal process.
  “The European court of justice has made it clear that rulings similar to this
  will be under greater scrutiny from national courts in future. Only then will
  fairness and due process be granted to every team.” Palace were also critical
  of their treatment at Cas, with frustration understood to stem from its
  refusal to consider what they believe was crucial evidence of correspondence
  between the ECA and some of its clubs over the extended deadline. “While we
  respect the Cas tribunal members, the process is designed to severely restrict
  and, in our case, make it almost impossible to receive a fair hearing. “The
  denial of all disclosure requests to obtain correspondence between the
  relevant parties, the refusal to allow witness testimony from those involved
  and the general lack of formality and respect for law mean decisions cannot be
  properly challenged, leading to pre-determined outcomes.” Cas said: “Cas rules
  are longstanding and designed to ensure fairness in the sporting world. In
  line with this practice, all parties on 8 August 2025 were given a formal
  opportunity to raise any concern about the running of the process. No
  objections were raised to state that the right to a fair hearing was not
  respected.” Uefa declined to comment.
