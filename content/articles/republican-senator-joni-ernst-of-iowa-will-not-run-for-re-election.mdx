  The US Republican senator Joni Ernst of Iowa is not expected to seek
  re-election next year, according to multiple news reports, a move that could
  open a competitive seat in the high-stakes battle to control the chamber. CBS
  News was the first to report that Ernst had told confidantes that she intends
  to announce her decision not to seek re-election next week. Ernst’s office and
  campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Ernst, 55,
  became the first woman to represent Iowa in the US Senate when she was elected
  in 2014. Her decision follows an announcement by the Iowa governor, Republican
  Kim Reynolds, to not seek re-election. Earlier this week, a Democrat prevailed
  in a special election for a state senate seat in an Iowa district that voted
  heavily for Donald Trump in 2024. The victory raised Democrats’ hopes in a
  state that has drifted away from them over the past decade and where they
  haven’t won a statewide Senate race since 2008. Republicans currently control
  the US Senate by a 53-to-47 margin. Despite Trump’s low approval ratings,
  growing economic uncertainty and historical patterns that show the president’s
  party losing ground in the midterm elections, nonpartisan election analysts
  say Republicans are favored to keep control of the Senate. Ernst would be the
  second Republican senator to not seek re-election, after Thom Tillis, a
  two-term incumbent from North Carolina, announced his retirement a day after
  voting against Trump’s signature domestic policy bill. Of the 22 Republican
  seats up for election next year, only the North Carolina race is rated a
  toss-up, according to the Cook Political Report. It had ranked Ernst’s seat
  “likely” to remain in the Republican column. Earlier this summer, Ernst drew
  fierce backlash when she appeared to dismiss voter fears that Medicaid cuts in
  the Republican immigration and tax package would put lives at risk, telling a
  town hall audience: “We all are going to die.” Rather than backtrack or
  apologize, Ernst doubled down in a video. “I made an incorrect assumption that
  everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish
  from this earth,” she said. “So I apologize, and I’m really, really glad that
  I did not have to bring up the subject of the tooth fairy as well.” Ernst had
  also faced sharp criticism from the president’s supporters when she expressed
  reservations with Pete Hegseth, then Trump’s nominee to head the Department of
  Defense who faced allegations of sexual assault – which he denied – and
  repeatedly expressed opposition to women in combat roles. Facing threats of a
  rightwing primary challenge, Ernst, a survivor of sexual assault who had
  become a champion of issues related to women in the military, caved to the
  pressure and ultimately voted to confirm Hegseth. Democrats celebrated Ernst’s
  prospective retirement. At least five Democratic candidates have announced
  they will run for the seat. “Joni Ernst is retiring because she knows that
  Iowans are furious at her and Washington Republicans for threatening our
  healthcare and spiking costs for families,” said Rita Hart, chair of the Iowa
  Democratic party. “Iowans continue to show that they are ready for change, and
  we will be working overtime to elect a Democrat to represent us in the Senate
  in 2026.”
