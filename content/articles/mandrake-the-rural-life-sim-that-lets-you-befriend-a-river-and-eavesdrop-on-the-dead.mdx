  Mandrake – the rural life sim that lets you befriend a river and eavesdrop on
  the dead

  With dulcet Welsh tones, an actor bearing an uncanny aural resemblance to
  Michael Sheen introduces players to the world of Mandrake. The village of
  Chandley is “small” and “complicated”, he says warmly. “Everyone’s got their
  own story.” The action cuts between cosy, wooden cottages and a moss-covered
  forest filled with folkloric creatures. We see the protagonist, a
  horticulturist wizard “steeped in the green and growing arts”, returning home
  and tending to an abundance of vegetables. Some you’ll find in your local
  supermarket; others are of a decidedly more magical variety. As a rural life
  simulation, Mandrake is odder and more beguiling than most. It possesses the
  same undeniable allure as classics such as Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley,
  inviting players to slip into the seasonal flow of crop cultivation,
  countryside exploration and conversations with suspiciously cheerful
  townsfolk. But there’s more going on here: lush, painterly visuals to start.
  And should you tire of tilling the soil, you might wander off the beaten path
  of this mythical, Brythonic-inspired land, perhaps eavesdropping on the dead
  or even befriending a river. Weirdness is to be expected in a new release from
  Failbetter, the boutique UK studio behind acclaimed titles Fallen London and
  Sunless Sea. Set in a shared fictional universe, that narrative RPG and moody
  survival experience, respectively, were masterclasses in evocative prose and
  captivating world-building. London became “Fallen”, submerged in a darkened
  underworld called the Neath, newly situated on the coast of a vast, black
  ocean – the so-called Unterzee. These games, horrifying and hilarious in
  nearly equal measure, were rooted in a deft sense of place. Mandrake
  foregrounds location in a friendlier, more accessible way. The beauty of the
  rural life sim, as game director Adam Myers sees it, is that “you’re able to
  zoom in on one community over time”. Across days, nights and seasons, the
  player bears witness to a changing place and its people. You go from a sense
  of total unfamiliarity, says Myers, to having developed a deep knowledge of
  the environment. But Mandrake aims to eschew the genre’s grindier tendencies –
  cultivating acres of wheat and making multiple daily meals. “It isn’t optimal
  to grow your crops in large rectangular monocultures,” says Myers. “And you’re
  not doing the thing where you click 30 times and carry a banquet’s worth of
  ratatouille around in your inventory at all times.” Gift-giving, the typical
  way players ingratiate themselves with their NPC neighbours in this genre,
  arrives with a wrinkle. Players cannot just hand out presents randomly
  (“That’s a little awkward,” laughs Myers). Instead, they must declare why they
  are handing out their offerings. This forms the start of a relationship based
  on obligation. The aim is to not just replicate the pattern seen in other
  rural life sims, but “complicate” it, both through thoughtful mechanics and an
  unusual set of influences. Myers talks enthusiastically of anthropology,
  British folklore and esoteric traditions such as Renaissance alchemy. The
  world is filled with quirky and mysterious lore: it is inhabited by
  “quasi-monastic organisations” and despite the Welsh influences in the
  landscape, there is an eerie absence of sheep. The comforting rituals of the
  rural life sim seem to function as a Trojan horse for Failbetter’s peculiar
  and offbeat tendencies. “One of the error patterns we’ve fallen into in the
  past is going too weird, too fast, too soon,” admits Myers. “We need to give
  players more stable ground to stand on so they can make sense of everything –
  put the pieces together to properly appreciate what’s unusual and strange.”
  Ominous creatures undoubtedly lurk in these ancient woods; villagers are
  likely to conceal many portentous secrets. It’s reasonable to assume that
  Myers’s and his colleagues’ taste for the macabre surfaces in some manner. But
  there’s a crucial difference, a concession, perhaps, to maintaining what he
  hopes is a welcoming and “emotionally gentle” tone: unlike some of
  Failbetter’s other games, death doesn’t lurk quite so close to your shoulder.
  Or as Myers puts it, “you probably won’t be able to get yourself eaten in this
  one”. • Mandrake is in development for PC with console support planned.
