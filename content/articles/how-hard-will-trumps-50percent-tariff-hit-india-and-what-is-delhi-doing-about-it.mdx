  Donald Trump’s tariffs of 50% have come into force on most US imports from
  India. The US president followed through on his threat to punish one of the
  world’s largest economies for its purchases of discounted Russian oil. What
  might the impact be on India’s economy? Washington added an extra 25% duty on
  top of the 25% imposed earlier this month, citing India’s refusal to stop
  buying Russian crude and defence hardware. The duties, which are 16 percentage
  points higher than China, 31 points higher than most south-east Asian
  countries and 35 points above South Korea, have pushed US tariffs on Indian
  goods to levels that the investment house Nomura likened to a “trade embargo”.
  The US is India’s largest export market, worth $86.5bn (£64.1bn) a year.
  Around two-thirds of shipments are covered by the 50% tariff, threatening jobs
  and growth across sectors reliant on US demand. “No Indian product can stand
  any competitive edge under such heavy import taxes,” said Garima Kapoor of
  Elara Securities. Economists say the tariffs could erase up to one percentage
  point from India’s GDP growth this fiscal year. Unemployment is a worry.
  India’s overall jobless rate stood at 5.6% in June, rising to 7.1% in cities.
  A major drop in US exports could hit millions of workers, economists say.
  Where will the biggest impact be felt? India’s giant generic pharmaceuticals
  sector and its electronics and petroleum products are exempt from the tariffs.
  Aluminium, steel and copper remain at 25%, but job-heavy sectors such as
  textiles, jewellery, seafood and leather are squarely in the line of fire.
  Exports from affected sectors could plunge 70%, from $60.2bn to $18.6bn, while
  overall shipments to the US could fall by 43%, said Ajay Srivastava, a former
  Indian trade official and founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative,
  Delhi-based thinktank . Companies rushed shipments ahead of the 27 August
  cut-off. With the tariff wall now up, exporters must either swallow costs,
  which will be impossible for many, or cede market share to countries such as
  Vietnam, Bangladesh and Mexico. India’s $179bn textiles industry includes
  $37.7bn in exports, with the US buying nearly $10.3bn. Mithileshwar Thakur, of
  the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said Indian exporters now faced a
  30% cost disadvantage compared with Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia. “This is
  an earthquake,” said Kirit Bhansali, chair of the Gems and Jewellery Export
  Promotion Council. Even if tariffs are lowered later, competitors may have
  already locked in US market share. “Competitors like China, Vietnam, Mexico,
  Turkey, and even Pakistan, Nepal, Guatemala and Kenya stand to gain,
  potentially locking India out of key markets even after tariffs are rolled
  back,” Srivastava said. Can India wean itself off Russian oil? India, the
  world’s third-largest oil consumer and top buyer of Russian seaborne crude,
  could wean itself off Russian oil over time. But right now it views Russia as
  an all-weather friend – a vital defence and energy ally amid the trade turmoil
  that Trump has unleashed. Russia supplies about 40% of India’s oil needs, up
  from less than 1% before the Ukraine war. Even though discounts on Russian
  crude have narrowed from $20–$25 below benchmark Brent crude in 2022 to about
  $2.50 a barrel now, India continues buying because it secures energy reliably
  and relatively cheaply. A sudden reduction could also leave India vulnerable
  to global price swings. It will continue buying oil from wherever it gets the
  best deal and take measures to protect its national interest from US tariffs,
  India’s ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, told TASS onsaid at the weekend. He
  also said India was able to pay for Russian oil in rupees, which meant it
  didn’t have to use its US currency reserves. “Now, we have a working system of
  trade settlement in national currencies. There is no problem now in payment
  for oil imports,” he said. Indian firms are calculated to have saved $17bn by
  buying cheaper Russian oil since the start of the war in Ukraine, but that
  could be dwarfed by the impact of tariffs on exporters, which could cut
  India’s US exports by nearly $37bn this financial year, said Srivastava. What
  is India doing to mitigate the impact? Narendra Modi’s government has urged
  Indians to buy domestically made goods. “I appeal to the citizens of our
  country to prioritise purchasing goods that are made in India,” the prime
  minister said this week. The government also plans to shake up the nationwide
  goods and services tax, cutting most rates to 5% or 18% to boost spending.
  Essentials such as food, textiles and cement will become cheaper, while luxury
  goods remain pricey. The government is reportedly assembling a
  multibillion-dollar package to free up cash for exporters. India has been
  seeking to diversify its markets and recently signed a free trade deal with
  the UK. But exporters say much more is needed. The Federation of Indian Export
  Organisations (FIEO) has called for a state-supported one-year moratorium on
  repaying the principal and interest on loans to free up cash for diversifying
  markets. “We are staring at a crisis which will force shutdowns and cause
  unemployment,” said the FIEO’s president, SC Ralha. The AEPC has appealed for
  interest relief to counter high borrowing costs of between 8% and 12%,
  compared with 3% in China and Malaysia. India is also cautiously warming up to
  Chinese investment as part of a strategic pivot in response to escalating US
  tariffs. Modi is making his first visit to China since relations went into a
  deep freeze following a brutal clash along their disputed border in 2020 to
  attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. He said this week the
  world was living through an era of “economic selfishness” in which countries
  pursue their own interests first. “No matter how high the pressure, India will
  continue to build its strength to withstand it,” he added. “India is ready to
  pay a very heavy price to protect its interests.”
