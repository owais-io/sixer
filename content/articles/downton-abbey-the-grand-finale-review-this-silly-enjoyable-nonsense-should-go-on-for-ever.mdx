  Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale review – this silly, enjoyable nonsense should
  go on for ever
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-09-03T20:00:32Z'
bodyText: >-
  Grand finale? Oh please. Let’s get real; there is no reason why this
  particular brand of gibbering, wittering, blithering and surreally enjoyable
  nonsense shouldn’t go on for ever, like Frank Sinatra’s farewell tour or
  shortbread manufacture in the Scottish Highlands. Both of the previous Downton
  films had a sentimental last-hurrah message that didn’t preclude another one
  dropping off the production line. We could make the next film Downton Abbey:
  The Royal Finale and the one after that Downton Abbey: The Imperial Finale.
  The last but one film finished on a funereal drone shot of Downton Abbey at
  sunset and the one after that was subtitled “A New Era” – but this one, it
  seems, has taken us back to the very end of the old era, inviting us to swoon
  loyally at the passing of something special and yet also at the same time doff
  our caps at the bluebloods’ insouciant gift for survival. There is something
  entertainingly outrageous in the pure tongue-in-cheek craziness of this new
  film’s opening sequence; it could almost count as a dadaist dream sequence. I
  don’t think anything in the TV show or the movies had anything as
  mickey-takingly bizarre. The scene is London in 1930 and Lady Mary (Michelle
  Dockery) is at a grand society occasion with her parents, the Earl of Grantham
  (Hugh Bonneville) and the Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), when the
  rumour runs round the assembled company that – gasp! – Lady Mary is
  technically a divorced woman and so has to be expelled from the party before
  the royals turn up. The shock of Lady Mary being divorced is presented with
  impeccable seriousness, like news of a terrorist bomb. Julian Fellowes is, of
  course, sporting with us, and yet you can’t help smiling along. Fellowes also
  once again cheekily recycles an idea from his country-house screenplay Gosford
  Park from 2001, directed by Robert Altman; in that film he had Ivor Novello
  turning up as a guest, now it’s Noël Coward (Arty Froushan), whose celebrity
  presence at Downton convinces all the local nobility to accept Lady Mary’s
  status as a divorcee. Life at Downton is as eventful as ever, with Lord G
  brooding on whether to accept Lady Mary’s succession as the mistress of the
  house, and graciously retreat with his wife to the “Dower House” occupied by
  his late mother. A rather gruesome Hammer horror portrait of the late Maggie
  Smith now dominates the building. Lady Grantham’s sheepish American brother
  Harold (Paul Giamatti) comes to stay with his smoothie financial adviser Gus
  Sambrook (Alessandro Nivola); the latter gives Lady Mary the eye. And below
  stairs, housekeeper Elsie Hughes (Phyllis Logan) calms the premarital nerves
  of Mrs Patmore (Lesley Nicol), assuring her that conjugal responsibilities are
  in fact “terrific fun!” (The film should get an 18 certificate for this line
  alone.) The film is very silly and always watchable in its weird way, with
  those eccentrically emphasised shots of characters thanking each other for
  their thoughtfulness. The next Downton Abbey film will surely have to make
  these characters absorb the rise of fascism and the stormclouds of war. It
  promises to be a diverting spectacle. • Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale is out
  on 11 September in Australia, and on 12 September in the UK and US.
