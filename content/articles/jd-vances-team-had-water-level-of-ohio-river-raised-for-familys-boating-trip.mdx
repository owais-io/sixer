  JD Vance’s team had the army corps of engineers take the unusual step of
  changing the outflow of a lake in Ohio to accommodate a recent boating
  excursion on a family holiday, the Guardian has learned. The request from the
  US Secret Service was made to “support safe navigation” of the US
  vice-president’s security detail for an August outing on the Little Miami
  River, according to a statement by the US army corps of engineers (USACE).
  Vance was spotted in the south-western Ohio area on 2 August, his 41st
  birthday, according to social media posts that noted he was seen canoeing on
  the river, a tributary that Caesar Creek Lake feeds into. One source with
  knowledge of the matter who communicated with the Guardian anonymously alleged
  that the outflow request for the Caesar Creek Lake was not just to support the
  vice-president’s Secret Service detail, but also to create “ideal kayaking
  conditions”. The Guardian could not independently confirm this specific claim.
  The news raises questions about whether Vance’s office was potentially
  exploiting public infrastructure resources for his personal recreation at a
  time when the Trump administration has cut billions of dollars in foreign aid,
  scientific research and government jobs as part of its “efficiency” drive. The
  vice-president’s office did not respond to a request for comment. The Guardian
  first approached the USACE in Louisville for a comment about the change on
  Tuesday. Publicly available data on the US Geological Survey (USGS) shows a
  sudden increase in the river level and corresponding drop in lake elevation
  during the early August days when Vance was vacationing. The request was
  forwarded to the USACE headquarters. In a statement emailed to the Guardian on
  Wednesday, spokesperson Gene Pawlik said the USACE Louisville had received “a
  request to temporarily increase outflows from Caesar Creek Lake to support
  safe navigation of US Secret Service personnel”. In a statement, the Secret
  Service said it had closely coordinated with the Ohio department of natural
  resources and USACE to conduct planning to ensure motorized watercraft and
  emergency personnel could operate safely during a recent visit. It said it
  could not discuss specifics of its operational planning. It is not
  unprecedented for the USACE to modify outflows to accommodate public use – for
  example, for use in community river events and training for emergency
  responders. In one instance, Caesar Creek Lake’s USACE, Louisville district
  Facebook page announced a “special release” as requested by the Ohio
  department of natural resources last year on 22 August but later publicly
  announced that the special release had been cancelled. No such public
  announcement was made before 1 August. According to the Guardian’s anonymous
  source with knowledge of the matter, “special releases” are generally not done
  for individuals or by individual request. The Guardian also sought information
  about whether the request was appropriately documented. USACE regulations
  regarding requests for so-called “deviations” – or any changes to normal
  practices – require approval and documentation that demonstrates why the
  deviation is justified. This process also ensures that risks associated with
  any deviation – including a flood risk or other environmental impact – is
  detailed. Pawlik said the Secret Service request “met the operational criteria
  outlined in the Water Control Manual for Caesar Creek Lake and did not require
  a deviation from normal procedures”. He added: “It was determined that the
  operations would not adversely affect downstream or upstream water levels.
  Downstream stakeholders were notified in advance of the slight outflow
  increase, which occurred August 1, 2025.” While there is no allegation that
  Vance’s office did anything illegal, the ethics lawyer Richard Painter, who
  served in the George W Bush administration, said it seemed hypocritical and
  “pretty outrageous” for Vance to be receiving these particular accommodations
  for his family holiday when the administration’s cuts have led to drastic cuts
  in the National Park Service (NPS). The National Parks Conservation
  Association has estimated that the NPS has lost about a quarter of its staff
  since January, which in turn has led to sections of some parks to be closed
  and hours to be changed due to staffing issues. “Those cuts are directly
  impacting middle-class families’ vacations,” Painter said. “Whether they are
  doing it for the Secret Service or for him I think is splitting hairs. What he
  ought to be doing is choosing another place.” Norm Eisen, a former White House
  special counsel for ethics and government reform, said: “When I was President
  Obama’s ethics czar in the White House I got a lot of unusual requests, but I
  never got one to increase the outflow of a waterway as part of a government
  official going kayaking. “My nickname was ‘Mr No’ and I certainly would have
  lived up to it in this situation. I never would have permitted this kind of a
  thing because whether it technically violates the rules or not, it creates the
  appearance that the vice-president of the United States is getting special
  treatment that’s not available to the average person who wants to utilise that
  body of water for recreational purposes. “While there may well be
  security-related explanations or justifications that come into the analysis,
  my reaction is: I don’t care. We shouldn’t be utilising government resources
  in this way. I never would have allowed it.” Additional reporting by Kira
