  When a team lose the aura of champions, it can go absolutely. Opponents
  suddenly look at them and wonder what on earth once seemed so intimidating,
  how on earth a bunch of players in these shirts, even with this manager, could
  seem so unbeatable. At half-time Manchester City led, and seemed comfortable
  in their lead against opponents who had never got going. But by the time
  Brajan Gruda calmly rounded James Trafford and dumped Rayan Aït-Nouri on his
  backside before rolling into an empty net, a Brighton winner had come to seem
  almost overdue. Seconds earlier Trafford had made a remarkable save,
  stretching back and to his left to claw away a deflected Jan Paul van Hecke
  shot. But there had been opportunities before that as well; the Brighton surge
  had become relentless. Fabian Hürzeler, the Brighton manager, must take credit
  for a quadruple substitution on the hour that transformed the game, but just
  as striking was how vulnerable City became to balls played in behind their
  defensive line, particularly after the substitution of Bernardo Silva on 72
  minutes. The structure that once gave City a stifling control has vanished
  almost entirely, the optimism of that opening romp against Wolves long since
  departed. Give them space and they will still take advantage, but put them
  under pressure and the fissures and flaws are evident. Almost every recent
  opponent – Crystal Palace, Al Hilal, Tottenham, even Wolves in the opening
  minutes – has shown how the space between back four and keeper can be
  exploited. The sense for Brighton until now had been of performances having
  been rather better than results. Although they conceded a stoppage‑time
  equaliser at home against Fulham and then lost at Everton, where they missed a
  penalty and twice hit the woodwork, they had won the xG convincingly in both
  games. But they began poorly, undermined by a lack of precision and
  decisiveness, a laxity that created a mood of frustration; a pass completion
  rate of under 75% before half‑time told its own story. City weren’t at
  anything like their fluent best, which is perhaps no real surprise given the
  number of players they are trying to integrate and the disruption to their
  pre-season caused by participation in the Club World Cup. Even the return of
  Rodri for his first Premier League start since he damaged a knee against
  Arsenal last September could not generate the old sense of calm. Although
  there were some signs of at least some of the familiar City rhythm returning,
  this remains a team more dependent on individuals for attacking penetration
  than the stereotype of a Pep Guardiola side. Erling Haaland, as ever, was the
  major threat, although these days even he misfires more than he scores. After
  scuffing one early chance, he had dragged another effort just wide and then
  headed straight at Bart Verbruggen from close range when, presented with an
  opportunity following Omar Marmoush’s run, he dinked the ball neatly over the
  goalkeeper. Brighton, perhaps, will feel they should have cleared, Marmoush
  somehow bundling through a challenge from Van Hecke before dabbing a pass
  between Lewis Dunk’s legs. Perhaps because of that individualism, though, City
  are vulnerable to counterattacks, in the way that Guardiola sides playing
  below their best often are. It is a long time since they really controlled a
  midfield as they did so often in the treble season. Long before Gruda’s
  winner, Trafford had had to make a good saves to keep out Kauro Mitoma and
  Yakuba Minteh, while Diego Gómez squandered a similar opportunity by
  manhandling Abdukodir Khusanov. Minteh’s chance, in particular, seemed to
  unsettle City and it was soon after that, after the needless concession of a
  free-kick on the right by Khusanov, that Dunk’s volley smacked into Matheus
  Nunes’s upraised arm. James Milner, six years after he last scored, converted
  against his former club to become the second oldest (behind Teddy Sheringham),
  as well as the second youngest (behind James Vaughan), scorer in Premier
  League history. What was notable then was just how incapable City seemed of
  stopping the Brighton flow. Trafford made save after save before, in the 89th
  minute, another turnover led to a four-on-three break. Mitoma picked his pass
  with typical composure and Gruda, presented with yet another one-on-one,
  almost casually converted. City, somehow, had lost a game they seemed to have
  under control with half an hour to go. But worse than that, they no longer
  have the demeanour of champions. It may return, but for now other Premier
  League sides will look at them and see opportunity.
