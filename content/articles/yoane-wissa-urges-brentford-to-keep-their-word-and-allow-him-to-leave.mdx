  Yoane Wissa has accused Brentford of reneging on promises to allow him to
  leave west London this summer as Newcastle waited for Liverpool to bid again
  for Alexander Isak. Should either Wissa’s final attempt to force a move to St
  James’ Park prove effective or Wolves agree to sell their Norway striker
  Jorgen Strand Larsen to Newcastle, it is building to a frantic final hours
  before the window’s closure on Monday night. The arrival of Wissa, Strand
  Larsen, or another forward on Tyneside would almost certainly trigger Isak’s
  long mooted transfer to Merseyside, quite possibly for a sum close to the
  £110m offer Liverpool have on the table. If, however, Brentford and Wolves
  keep their strikers, the transfer picture becomes more complicated. Although
  Newcastle have signed Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart for £70m their manager,
  Eddie Howe, views the Germany forward as more a No 10 than a nine and still
  wants a centre forward to replace Isak. Howe said the 6ft 6in Woltemade has
  all the attributes his side has lacked in the Swede’s absence so far this
  season. “Everything that we were probably lacking today, I think he can bring.
  There will be a period where he has to adapt. It’s always very difficult to
  come straight into the league. I’ve got really high hopes for him. I just
  don’t want to add to the pressure that he’s going to be under. But I think he
  can be a difference-maker.” Howe has indicated that the Sweden international’s
  continued refusal to train or play has made the situation untenable and a sale
  might be best for all parties, but Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners may yet
  demand at least £130m. Should Woltemade prove their sole striker arrival, they
  would be under no real financial pressure to sell Isak. Given that £130m may
  prove too high, Isak’s future has become a game of who blinks first. Much may
  hinge on Brentford and Wissa. Like Isak, the striker used Instagram to
  pressure his club into selling him. “With just hours remaining of the transfer
  window I feel compelled to make it clear that I want to leave Brentford, “
  wrote Wissa, who scored 19 Premier League goals last season but has not played
  for Keith Andrews’s side this season. “I believe the club are unduly standing
  in my way despite a series of fair offers throughout the summer.” Newcastle
  recently saw a bid worth up to £40m rejected for Wissa. Brentford are now
  understood to be demanding £65m for a forward who turns 29 in September.
  Following Saturday’s 2-1 defeat at Sunderland, Andrews said he expected the
  absent striker to still be part of his squad on Tuesday. “Earlier this summer
  I held open discussions with the club’s senior management including key
  directors and the new head coach,” added Wissa. “I made clear my intention to
  explore a new challenge. During those conversations it was confirmed to me and
  my representatives that the club would not stand in my way if a reasonable
  offer was received. That was also put in writing. “Yet as the window comes to
  an end the club has now significantly changed its position. The commitment
  that I could leave this summer has not been fulfilled. I must insist that
  Brentford keep their word to let me join a new club at a fair price.” Wissa’s
  hopes of departing for Tyneside appeared to be damaged on Friday when
  Brentford’s £45m offer for Borussia Dortmund’s Maximilian Beier was rejected.
  Newcastle, meanwhile, have also seen two bids for Strand Larsen, the second
  worth £55m, knocked back by Wolves. The now unsettled Norway striker missed
  his side’s 3-2 defeat to Everton on Saturday with a “minor injury”. Afterwards
  the Wolves manager, Vitor Pereira said: “The information I have is he will
  stay with us.” After watching Newcastle draw 0-0 at Leeds on Saturday evening
  Howe responded to reports in Sweden claiming Isak had already bid farewell to
  his St James’ teammates. “He hasn’t said goodbye to me, I’ve had no
  communication with him,” said Newcastle’s manager. “I’ve no knowledge that it
  didn’t happen but I certainly can’t say it did because that’s the first I’ve
  heard of it.”
