  Southern Europe is experiencing deadly heat of up to 44C with scientists
  warning of a “molotov cocktail” of climatic conditions that is fuelling vast
  wildfires across the Mediterranean. In Spain, nearly 6,000 people have been
  evacuated due to wildfires continuing to burn. In Italy, a four-year-old boy
  died of heatstroke and in France, more than half the country was under
  heatwave warnings on Monday. Extreme heat can pose serious health risks,
  especially for babies, children, pregnant women and elderly people. We’d like
  to know what it’s like where you live. How are you coping and what steps are
  you taking to deal with high temperatures? What is your home and working
  environment like? How does it compare with previous summers? What are your
  plans for the coming months and what are your concerns? If you’re having
