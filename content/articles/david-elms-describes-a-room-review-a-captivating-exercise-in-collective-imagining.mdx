  David Elms Describes a Room review – a captivating exercise in collective
  imagining

  ‘Shall we give ourselves a night off from being funny?” There are unassuming
  performance styles, then there’s David Elms. At a festival that teems with
  ingratiating theatrics, it’s quite the gearshift to watch Elms deliver this
  hour of improv with no mic, props, a set or anything else prepared. We have to
  lean in, which is useful for a show that relies on the audience’s suggestions
  to crank things up. Some may find David Elms Describes a Room underpowered.
  But it’s right up the street of those of us who love improv when it’s not
  beholden to the gag, and given space to breathe. This solo offering, from an
  act better known as sidekick to Nick (Mr Swallow) Mohammed, is built around an
  improv exercise in which a performer invites the audience to dream up and
  describe the room he’s occupying. There’s a stag’s head on the wall, someone
  proposes. There’s a window overlooking a mountain. With nudges from Elms, and
  just a little fun backchat, a picture takes shape of every nook and corner of
  this room – some kind of hunting lodge tonight, with “between five and 18”
  Russian men in a sauna just beyond the door. It feels like, and indeed
  literally is, scene-setting, in anticipation of a scene to come. One soon
  wonders, such is the detail Elms goes into and his unhurried style, whether
  any such scene will eventuate – or whether the describing is an end in itself.
  Were that so, this would remain an unshowy delight of a fringe venture, with
  Elms the softly spoken foreman of a construction site of the mind, located
  somewhere between the audience’s ideas and his own. We do finally see him
  occupy the space we’ve built, interacting wordlessly with each mimed item,
  suggesting, with an almost vanishing subtlety, narrative connections between
  this feature and that. As the audience laughs to see each proposal recalled,
  it’s an object(less) lesson in the transcendent power of collective imagining,
  and in how little is needed to bring a story and performance to life. It’s
  also a lovely, skilful and understated hour of extempore comedy. • At
  Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival
