  Scientists have developed a simple blood test to spot ovarian cancer early
  that could “significantly improve” outcomes for women with the disease. More
  than 300,000 women, mostly over the age of 50, are diagnosed worldwide each
  year, according to the World Cancer Research Fund. Ovarian cancer is often
  diagnosed late, which makes treating the condition more difficult. The test
  trialled by UK and US researchers looks for two different types of blood
  markers in those showing symptoms of the disease, which include pelvic pain
  and a bloated tummy. It then uses machine learning to recognise patterns that
  would be difficult for humans to detect. Currently, the disease is usually
  diagnosed using a mix of scans and biopsies, such as an ultrasound scan, a CT
  scan, a needle biopsy, a laparoscopy or surgery to remove tissue or possibly
  the ovaries. It is often detected late because symptoms such as bloating,
  feeling full quickly after eating or having to pee frequently are not always
  obvious potential signs of cancer. The blood test looks for what ovarian
  cancer sheds into the bloodstream, even in its early stages. Cancer cells
  release fragments into the blood that carry tiny, fat-like molecules known as
  lipids, along with certain proteins. This combination of lipids and proteins
  are like a biological fingerprint for ovarian cancer, according to AOA Dx,
  which developed the test. It also uses an algorithm that has been trained on
  thousands of patient samples to recognise subtle patterns across these lipids
  and proteins that signal ovarian cancer. The test can detect the disease “at
  early stages and with greater accuracy than current tools”, according to Alex
  Fisher, the chief operating officer and co-founder of AOA Dx. Dr Abigail
  McElhinny, the chief science officer at AOA Dx, added: “By using machine
  learning to combine multiple biomarker types, we’ve developed a diagnostic
  tool that detects ovarian cancer across the molecular complexity of the
  disease in sub-types and stages. “This platform offers a great opportunity to
  improve the early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, potentially resulting in better
  patient outcomes and lower costs to the healthcare system.” A study, led by
  the universities of Manchester and Colorado and published in the American
  Association of Cancer Research journal Cancer Research Communications, tested
  832 samples using the AOA Dx platform. In samples from the University of
  Colorado, the test was able to accurately detect ovarian cancer across all
  stages of the disease 93% of the time, and 91% in the early stages. In samples
  from the University of Manchester, the test showed 92% accuracy at all stages
  and 88% accuracy in early stages. Emma Crosbie, a professor at the University
  of Manchester and an honorary consultant in gynaecological oncology at
  Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, said: “AOA Dx’s platform has the
  potential to significantly improve patient care and outcomes for women
  diagnosed with ovarian cancer. “We are eager to continue advancing this
  important research through additional prospective trials to further validate
  and expand our understanding of how this could be integrated into existing
  healthcare systems.”
