  Morning everyone. As police begin a fourth day searching for Porepunkah
  fugitive Dezi Freeman, a former neighbour has claimed that he spied on her
  family with drones, forcing her to take out a court order against him. Council
  workers in Adelaide are collecting hundreds of kilos of dead fish from the
  city’s algae-hit beaches, New South Wales hospitals are struggling to cope
  with a spike in winter illness, and our guns investigation looks into
  “permission to shoot” letters. Australia ‘Slow-onset disaster’ | Council
  workers in South Australia are combing Adelaide’s beaches every day and
  collecting up to 200kg of dead marine creatures killed by the state’s algal
  boom as experts warn the disaster could take a mental toll on the community.
  Porepunkah hunt | A former neighbour of the suspected Porepunkah gunman says
  he used to hunt for deer nearby, had an intimate knowledge of Mount Buffalo
  and used to spy on her, including with drones. As police face severe weather
  in the search, officers are still working on the theory that Dezi Freeman, who
  knows the terrain well and is said to have good bushcraft skills, remains in
  the local area. Legal drama | Six years after Brittany Higgins alleged she was
  raped in Linda Reynolds’s office in Parliament House, the legal fallout
  rumbles on with the former senator winning a defamation case her ex-staffer
  this week. Is that the end of the matter or is there more legal drama still to
  come? Hospital overcrowding | The New South Wales health minister has
  encouraged people to call the health hotline instead of going to emergency
  departments as a spike in winter illnesses has doctors saying overcrowding is
  the “worst they have ever seen”. Here come the Suns | Gold Coast sports fans
  hope that the Suns’ achievement in making the finals for the first time will
  help the city make its mark on the sporting landscape. World Current event |
  The collapse of a critical Atlantic current can no longer be considered a
  low-likelihood event, a study has concluded, making deep cuts to fossil fuel
  emissions even more urgent to avoid the catastrophic impact. Health crisis | A
  standoff over the firing of the Susan Monarez, the director of the US Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention, has deepened, with Monarez’s lawyers
  claiming she will not depart unless Donald Trump himself removes her. Robert
  Kennedy Jr faces calls to quit as health secretary after the firing of Monarez
  and the resignation of key staff. The Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, has
  filed a lawsuit claiming the US president has no authority to fire her. Kyiv
  bombing | The UK Foreign Office has summoned the Russian ambassador after
  missile strikes on Kyiv killed at least 18 people – including four children –
  and damaged the city’s British Council office. Kyiv residents remain
  fatalistic but defiant amid the onslaught. Misinformation trap | Police
  Scotland have warned the public not to share misinformation about an incident
  in Dundee involving a 12-year-old girl after online speculation was amplified
  by Elon Musk and Tommy Robinson. Fake porn anger | A pornographic website that
  posted doctored photos of a host of high-profile Italian women including the
  prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and the opposition leader, Elly Schlein, has
  sparked outrage in Italy. Full Story Back to Back Barries: can the Coalition
  find a circuit breaker? Barrie Cassidy and Tony Barry discuss the expulsion of
  Australia’s Iranian ambassador and Anthony Albanese’s plan to help first home
  buyers. They also examine what the Coalition could do to get out of its
  post-election slump. In-depth There are more than 200,000 category A hunting
  licences in NSW, but official figures reckon that only 11,000 people take part
  in recreational hunting each year. This startling discrepancy encapsulates
  concern among gun control advocates who say people are exploiting lax
  regulation of “permission-to-shoot” letters to obtain guns. Sarah Martin and
  Christopher Knaus have this special report. Not the news Marathon running has
  never been so popular. In the five years before Covid, the Sydney marathon
  averaged 4,000 finishers. It has now transformed itself into a so-called
  marathon major and this Sunday it expects 35,000 runners. Other city marathons
  have entered the race for runners in recent years such as Ballarat and
  Wollongong, and Geelong is ready to fire the start’s pistol next year. Elise
  Beacom tries to keep up with the pace. Sport Cycling | Australia’s Jay Vine
  launched a solo attack off a breakaway group in the final 20km to win stage
  six of the Vuelta a España overnight. Four-time Tour de France champion Chris
  Froome is in a stable condition after a crash during training near Toulon
  which left him with a collapsed lung, broken back and broken ribs. Tennis |
  Iga Świątek has beaten Suzan Lamens in straight sets and Jannik Sinner and
  Naomi Osaka are also in action at Flushing Meadows. Follow it live. Football |
  Liverpool will play Real Madrid in one of the standout ties in the Champions
  League draw, while the opponents for holders PSG include Barcelona and
  Newcastle. Some Manchester United insiders think Ruben Amorim could quit as
  coach after his team’s disastrous loss at Grimsby. Media roundup The opening
  of a Viking exhibition at Melbourne Museum is being overshadowed by funding
  and jobs cuts, the Age claims. The heartbroken parents of the girl killed in a
  bus crash have told the Geelong Advertiser that their “worst fears” have come
  true. The Telegraph says commuters are furious with the council for failing to
  provide enough car parking spaces at Kellyville Metro in Sydney. What’s
