  Ireland’s World Cup squad have offered their support to their teammate Shannon
  Ikahihifo after she revealed her breast cancer diagnosis. The Trailfinders
  second-row Ikahihifo, who has three Irish caps, was part of the pre-tournament
  training group but did not make the final squad. On Friday the 30-year-old
  posted news of her condition on Instagram, writing: “Crazy to think that one
  day you can be running around on the rugby pitch feeling completely fine, then
  five days later you’re sitting in a hospital room being told you have cancer.
  “ Still a little in shock if I’m honest, but I’m so blessed to have the most
  amazing husband, family and friends that always carry when things start to
  feel a bit heavy. Fair to say she’s been a pretty tough few weeks. But lucky
  we’re tougher.” Ireland’s co-captain Edel McMahon, speaking before her side’s
  opening match against Japan on Sunday, praised Ikahihifo’s honesty as she
  shared the team’s backing. “We found out as a group a little bit earlier than
  everyone else heard, but we respected Shannon’s space that she wanted to deal
  with this herself and even get to terms with what the news is,” she said. “A
  credit to her to be so brave to come out. It would be very easy to fall into
  the background and not say anything and not raise awareness herself. The full
  group are here to support her and we’re all thinking of her.” Scotland’s
  meeting with Wales on Saturday afternoon has the hallmarks of one of the
  tournament’s most important pool games. Canada are likely to win Pool B,
  meaning the Celtic clash in Salford may effectivelyin effect constitute a
  knockout game less than 24 hours after the tournament has kicksed off. The
  stakes are high, as is motivation for Scotland on multiple fronts. They will
  be fuelled by a desire to erase the painful memory of the last World Cup, in
  2022, when a first appearance in 12 years featured narrow losses to Australia
  and Wales and an exit at the pool stage. Hopes are high they can go at least
  one step further this time. That defeat by the Welsh came via a dramatic
  86th-minute penalty from Keira Bevan. Revenge is on the mind for Scotland.
  “There’s definitely still a sour taste in my mouth,” said Rachel Malcolm,
  Scotland’s captain, this week. “I think we probably underestimated how much
  relief we felt to just be there. I think this World Cup is different. We’ve
  gone back to back for the first time in a very long time in terms of
  qualifications.” But the buildup has been turbulent to say the least. Bryan
  Easson, the head coach, confirmed last month he would leave after the
  tournament, and there has been a public dispute between Scottish Rugby and its
  players over contracts. The Scotland wing Rhona Lloyd said recently that “more
  than half” of the 32-strong squad do not have a deal after the World Cup.
  Women’s rugby in Wales has endured similar problems in its early steps of
  professionalism but there is tentative optimism for this tournament after
  consecutive wooden spoons in the Six Nations. Sean Lynn’s arrival this year
  has brought renewed confidence that Wales are on the right lines, as did the
  drawn two-Test series against the Wallaroos in Australia. “We’re on the right
  track. I set targets after the Six Nations to the players. They went away and
  have come back in better shape,” Lynn said. “The big emphasis is making sure
  that we can play with the intensity that I want.” The game in Salford is part
  of the first double-header of the tournament on an opening weekend when all 16
  teams are in action. SaturThe day begins with the second game in Pool A as
  Australia begin their bid to reach a first Women’s Rugby World Cup final. They
  take on Samoa at 12pm. Later on Saturday two of the pre-tournament favourites,
  Canada and France, open their campaigns against Fiji and Italy respectively.
  Brazil make their tournament debut on Sunday against South Africa. The
  defending champions, New Zealand, will close out the opening weekend in a
  5.30pm kick-off against Spain in York.
