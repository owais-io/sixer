  October – as it happened

  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! The EU has announced it will launch the
  rollout of its new entry system involving fingerprinting and facial
  recognition instead of passport wet stamping on 12 October (12:41). Multiple
  leaders from EU countries lined up to warn about the consequences of the EU-US
  tariff deal agreed on the weekend, stressing that even thought it’s better
  than no deal, it would likely still hit the bloc’s economies, including France
  (14:41), Germany (14:05), and Italy (16:15). Italy has summoned the Russian
  ambassador to Rome after comments by the country’s president and two ministers
  were listed on the Russian government’s website as an example of Russophobic
  behaviour (12:26), with prime minister Giorgia Meloni expressing her
  solidarity and criticising Moscow for “yet another propaganda operation”
  (15:56). Ukraine’s parliament will vote on a new law on Thursday that would
  restore independence to two anti-corruption bodies, backtracking on a
  controversial law passed last week that curtailed their powers and led to a
  political crisis (17:28). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If
  you have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at
  jakub.krupa@theguardian.com. I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social
  and on X at @jakubkrupa. in Kyiv Ukraine’s parliament will vote on a new law
  on Thursday that would restore independence to two anti-corruption bodies,
  backtracking on a controversial law passed last week that curtailed their
  powers and led to a political crisis. Last week’s legal changes prompted rare
  wartime street protests against the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and
  accusations that the presidential office was trying to protect powerful
  associates from anti-corruption investigations. Thousands of people took to
  the streets of Kyiv and other cities, while European leaders spoke with
  Zelenskyy and made it clear that funding for Kyiv could be affected if he was
  seen to be hampering anti-corruption efforts. Surprised and alarmed by the
  strength of the reaction, Zelenskyy announced late last week that he had
  listened to the criticism and would table a new law. “It seems they really
  miscalculated, they completely underestimated the strength of the reaction,”
  said a western diplomat based in Kyiv. Several European leaders spoke last
  week with Zelenskyy about the law, urging him to find a way out of the crisis.
  “It was important for him to hear it from his peers,” said the diplomat.
  European officials have also cautiously criticised the bill in public. Over
  the past few week or so, we covered the controversial Ukrainian law changing
  the way the country’s anti-corruption agencies work, and the later U-turn from
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, proposing a new bill to address some of the issues that
  attracted widespread criticism across Europe. So, let’s go to Shaun Walker in
  Kyiv for the latest. Separately, hundreds of hikers and tourists were
  evacuated and dozens of trails closed after a series of rockfalls on the
  slopes of Cima Falkner in the Brenta Dolomites in the north of Italy, as
  experts warned of a sharp rise in landslides in the area linked to thawing
  permafrost. In recent days, visitors reported hearing loud booms followed by
  rockfalls and thick clouds of dust rising from Monte Pelmo in the Val di Zoldo
  after rocky pinnacles broke away and crashed down into the valley below in the
  municipality of Selva di Cadore in Italy’s Belluno province. Another collapse
  was recorded on Cima Falkner, where experts say the entire area is undergoing
  a process of erosion linked to rising temperatures and the wider climate
  emergency. Rockfalls have always occurred in the Dolomites, but experts this
  year warned of a striking rise in the number of collapses, driven by extreme
  heat and weather events intensified by the climate crisis. The German double
  Olympic biathlon champion Laura Dahlmeier has died after a mountaineering
  accident in Pakistan, her management confirmed on Wednesday. The accident
  occurred at around noon on Monday, at an altitude of approximately 5,700
  metres at Laila Peak, the Alpine Club of Pakistan said on Tuesday. Dahlmeier
  was climbing with her mountaineering partner when she was struck by a sudden
  rockfall in the Hushe Valley, part of the northern Gilgit-Baltistan region.
  “Laura Dahlmeier died on 28 July in a mountain accident on Laila Peak (6,069
  metres) in Pakistan’s Karakoram range,” her representatives told Germany’s Die
  Welt newspaper. “A recovery operation was launched but ultimately called off
  on the evening of 29 July.” Dahlmeier’s representatives added that she most
  likely died instantly, while her mountaineering partner was unharmed and
  remained at the site. Poor weather conditions have prevented a rescue
  helicopter from reaching the location. Italian economy minister Giancarlo
  Giorgetti is the latest senior EU minister warning that the US tariffs under
  the new EU-US deal will have a significant impact on the economy. The EU-US
  deal on tariffs agreed last weekend would have a cumulative, negative impact
  on Italian GDP of a maximum 0.5% next year, he added, in comments reported by
  Reuters. First industry estimates, quoted by the Italian media, indicated a
  €3bn-4bn damage to the Italian economy, with agri-food and wine believed to be
  among most affected. Separately, a survey of 150 Italian companies conducted
  by Promos Italia, quoted by Corriere della Sera, showed that 71% companies
  said they would face difficulties exporting to the US, and 77% were
  dissatisfied with the way the negotiations were handled. 46% expected to
  change their commercial relations with the US as a result. Italian prime
  minister Giorgia Meloni has backed the country’s president Sergio Mattarella
  and two government ministers after they were criticised by Russia for making
  allegedly “Russophobic” comments (12:26). In a statement on the government’s
  website, Meloni said: “The publication by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a
  list of alleged ‘Russophobes’ accused of ‘inciting hatred’ against Russia is
  nothing more than yet another propaganda operation, aimed at diverting
  attention from Moscow’s grave responsibility, well known to the international
  community and which the international community has condemned from the
  outset.” She added that Italy “has firmly chosen to stand alongside Ukraine in
  the face of the brutal war of aggression unleashed by Russia three years ago,
  and continues to guarantee its support to the Ukrainian people in their heroic
  resistance.” French president Emmanuel Macron reportedly told ministers that
  the EU-US deal reached at the weekend showed the bloc had not managed to be
  “feared” by US president Donald Trump. “To be free, you need to be feared. We
  were not feared enough,” he was quoted as telling ministers. Macron also
  reportedly said that “this is not the end of the story, and we will not stop
  there – this is a first step in a negotiation process that will continue,”
  according to comments relayed to journalists by French officials and reported
  by BFMTV, Le Figaro and AFP. Separately, French government spokesperson Sophie
  Primas told journalists that the government welcomed the stability arising
  from the new EU-US trade deal reached over the weekend, but offered an equally
  mixed response to the agreement. She said that the government was pleased with
  the fact that some of the “red lines” on agricultural products, health and
  safety standards, VAT, and digital services were respected throughout the
  negotiations. But she also repeated the ministerial criticism that the
  agreement was “unbalanced” and pointed out that there remained some
  uncertainty about the finer details of the deal, which needed to be negotiated
  to get “sector by sector” clarity of the final terms of the agreement. French
  prime minister François Bayrou previously said the EU had capitulated to
  Donald Trump’s threats of ever-increasing tariffs, as he labelled the
  framework deal struck in Scotland on Sunday as a “dark day” for the EU. Primas
  repeatedly declined to say what the president’s view of the deal was, but
  revealed that French president Emmanuel Macron made it clear to ministers that
  Europe needs to double down on its efforts to improve its competitiveness,
  sovereignty and reduce its dependence on foreign services. Speaking of the
  EU-US trade deal, German finance minister Lars Klingbeil joined the growing
  list of national leaders expressing their dissatisfaction with the agreement
  today, saying he feared it would hit the German economy. “I have no illusions
  about it, it is rather growth-weakening,” Klingbeil said in the presentation
  of the 2026 draft budget as per Reuters, lamenting that the EU was “too weak”
  in the negotiations. “I would have wished for a different outcome,” he said,
  before adding: “Still, all in all, it is good that there is an agreement with
  the US, that there are no further escalations.“ Meanwhile, US president Donald
  Trump has offered a reminder that his self-imposed deadline for trade deals is
  coming up on Friday, posting on Truth Social: THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE
  AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE — IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG DAY
  FOR AMERICA!!! He then added, with the same, erm, characteristic sense of
  urgency: AUGUST FIRST, A GREAT DAY FOR AMERICA!!! As explained earlier, the EU
  is working out the finer details of the EU-US deal to progress with its
  implementation (11:37). Back to Ukraine, Russia has claimed it developed some
  immunity to sanctions because it had lived under a huge number of them for a
  long time, Reuters reported. The latest response from the Kremlin comes as
  Russia continues to assess the recent declaration by US president Donald Trump
  signalling a 10-day deadline for reaching a ceasefire in Ukraine under the
  threat of economic sanctions against Moscow. in Brussels The EU has announced
  it will launch the rollout of its new entry system involving fingerprinting
  and facial recognition instead of passport wet stamping on 12 October. The EU
  entry exit system (EES) system is being introduced ahead of the midterm break
  on schools and will impact any tourists or business travellers who are not EU
  citizens, including Britons. “From 12 October onwards, member states will
  start introducing the EES gradually over a period of six months. Border
  authorities will progressively register the data of third country nationals
  crossing the borders. At the end of this period, the EES will be fully
  deployed at all border crossing points,” the EU said in a statement. The plan
  to capture biometrics is part of the EU’s wider “smart border” programme which
  will allow the EU to speed up the entry of pre-approved frequent non-EU
  travellers while at the same time fighting against irregular migration.
  Fingerprinting machines are already visible at the Eurostar terminal in London
  with kiosks being built for car, bus and truck passengers in Dover. Passengers
  will be required to have their fingerprints or facial image verified but not
  both after passing through a border for the first time. Once up and running
  fully it will be British tourists and other non-EU visitors will no longer
  have their passports stamped. It will also enable the EU to see, at a glance,
  whether the passenger is overstaying. “The is an advanced technological system
  that will digitally record the entries and exits of non-EU nationals
  travelling to 29 European countries, including Schengen Associated ones, for
  short stays. It will capture biometric data, such as fingerprints, facial
  image, and other travel information, gradually replacing the current system of
  passport stamping,” the European Commission said. Road transport operators
  including the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel had hoped an app would be ready for
  the launch of the EES, but it has been delayed as each member state works to
  integrate it into their own immigration system, which are of national, rather
  than EU, competency. The rollout will take place over six months. The EES
  requirements do not apply to all non-EU citizens with exclusions, for
  instance, for those with residence permits and passport holders from Iceland,
  Liechtenstein, Norway, or Switzerland or their family members. The Italian
  foreign ministry has summoned the Russian ambassador to Rome, Alexei
  Paramonov, after comments by the country’s president, foreign and defence
  ministers were listed on the Russian government’s website as “examples of
  Russophobia.” The lengthy list, published last week, includes quotes from
  politicians from Bulgaria, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic,
  Cyprus, the EU, France, Germany, Greece, Nato, the Netherlands, Luxembourg,
  Poland, and the US. For Italy, the list includes the country’s president
  Sergio Mattarella, foreign minister Antonio Tajani and defence minister Guido
  Crosetto. In a much-covered speech in Marseille (Europe Live on 6 February),
  Mattarella made a reference comparing the sentiments behind the Russian
  invasion of Ukraine to the rise of Nazi Germany. The Italian foreign
  ministry’s press release said that Tajani “considered the inclusion of the
  head of state on this list a provocation to the Republic and the Italian
  people.” in Brussels The European Commission held phone calls with officials
  in Washington yesterday with intense work under way to finesse the precise
  list of goods on the zero-for-zero tariff list. This is expected to be
  completed before a joint statement is made giving the detail to the headlines
  agreed at Donald Trump’s golf course on Sunday. The US is expected to
  implement its part of the deal by executive orders by Donald Trump before
  Friday with the EU still determining what legal instrument it will use to give
  legal effect to the deal, a move that is unlikely to happen this week. The EU
  will seek to copper-fasten the deal legally to guard against any attempts at
  changes by the US. Yesterday Howard Lutnick gave the impression that it may
  yet seek guarantees from the EU that there is no tech tax. The EU declined to
  comment on his remarks on CNBC in which he described the deal as “sensational”
  but insisted it retained the sovereign right to legislation however it saw
  fit. It is not clear what the timeline on giving the deal legal effect on the
  EU side is but nothing is expected before Friday. Tariff changes on the EU
  side involving an elimination of import duties are not as transformative to
  the trade relations with the US, said EU officials as more than 90% of goods
  the US sells into the EU attract either a zero tariff, or what an official
  described as a “nuisance tariff” or negligible tariff. Elsewhere, I am also
  keeping an eye on wildfires in Spain and Portugal as southern Europe continues
  to experience extreme temperatures this summer. Two wildfires broke out
  earlier this week in Cuevas del Valle in Castilla y León and in Las Hurdes in
  Extremadura regions of Spain, with firefighters still battling them on
  Wednesday morning with some residents having to evacuate their homes. The
  latest dramatic footage shared by the local authorities showed the contuining
  blaze captured from drones. Over in Portugal, while fires remain active in
  three areas if the country, they are reportedly closer to being under control.
  In Ponte de Lima, there is a six-kilometer active front, Diario de Noticias
  reported, with firefighters suffering from shortage of resources to fight the
  fire. Some parts of the country are set to be hit by another day of 40 degree
  heat today, with medium and high fire alert in multiple regions and most
  concern in the north of the country. The EU’s Copernicus programme captured
  the impact of the wildfires in Arouca and Ponte de Barca in a satellite
  picture posted on its Instagram page. One other topic to watch is the European
  reaction to France and the UK’s calls to recognise a Palestinian state. On
  Tuesday night, the foreign ministers of 15 countries issued a joint statement
  backing such move. France’s foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on X that
  the group “invite those who have not yet done so to join us,” with AFP noting
  that Paris is trying to “build a momentum around the formal recognition of a
  Palestinian state.” The group of 15 countries also include Andorra, Finland,
  Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Slovenia
  and Spain, as well as countries outside Europe such as Australia, Canada and
  New Zealand. Elsewhere, we are getting the latest economic figures from
  Germany and Italy with both reporting -0.1% GDP growth in the second quarter.
  Our business blog has more on the figures and their significance for the rate
  of growth in the eurozone. “The Russians want to continue the war. This war
  can only be stopped through force,” Andriy Yermak, the most senior aide to
  Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned this morning after another
  night of Russian attacks. A missile strike on a Ukrainian training unit killed
  three and injured 18, following a pattern of similar attacks on Ukrainian
  training centres in recent months. US president Donald Trump said last night
  he would give Russia ten days to cease fire – so that’s until 8 August – or
  face crippling economic sanctions. On his way back to the US from Scotland, he
  said the clock was ticking with 10 days to go. And since that was technically
  yesterday, we’re on D-9 today. The key question is what Trump will actually do
  when the clock runs down to zero, and this is exactly what Yermak’s comments
  this morning are about. Expect more of that language from various European
  leaders, joining Ukraine in the effort to push Trump into taking meaningful
  actions. Elsewhere, we are obviously following the tsunami warnings issued
  across the Pacific region after a major 8.8 magnitude earthquake in far east
  of Russia with all live updates here … … but on Europe live we will be looking
  also at the French government’s consultations with industries affected by the
  new EU-US deal, the wildfires in Portugal, and much more. I will bring you all
  key updates from across Europe here. It’s Wednesday, 30 July 2025, it’s Jakub
  Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.

France’s foreign minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on X that the group “invite those who have not yet done so to join us,” with AFP noting that Paris is trying to “build a momentum around the formal recognition of a Palestinian state.” The group of 15 countries also include Andorra, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Portugal, San Marino, Slovenia and Spain, as well as countries outside Europe such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Elsewhere, we are getting the latest economic figures from Germany and Italy with both reporting -0.1% GDP growth in the second quarter. Our business blog has more on the figures and their significance for the rate of growth in the eurozone. “The Russians want to continue the war. This war can only be stopped through force,” Andriy Yermak, the most senior aide to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, warned this morning after another night of Russian attacks. A missile strike on a Ukrainian training unit killed three and injured 18, following a pattern of similar attacks on Ukrainian training centres in recent months. US president Donald Trump said last night he would give Russia ten days to cease fire – so that’s until 8 August – or face crippling economic sanctions. On his way back to the US from Scotland, he said the clock was ticking with 10 days to go. And since that was technically yesterday, we’re on D-9 today. The key question is what Trump will actually do when the clock runs down to zero, and this is exactly what Yermak’s comments this morning are about. Expect more of that language from various European leaders, joining Ukraine in the effort to push Trump into taking meaningful actions. Elsewhere, we are obviously following the tsunami warnings issued across the Pacific region after a major 8.8 magnitude earthquake in far east of Russia with all live updates here … … but on Europe live we will be looking also at the French government’s consultations with industries affected by the new EU-US deal, the wildfires in Portugal, and much more. I will bring you all key updates from across Europe here. It’s Wednesday, 30 July 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
