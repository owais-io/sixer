  Meeting somewhere between post-punk and techno, electronic body music (EBM)
  emerged in early 1980s Europe as a darker, sweatier alternative to the more
  melodic synth music of the time. Made up of militant chants and muscular
  rhythms perforated with ominous clangs, the genre mostly thrived in goth bars
  and clubs, except for the odd chart entry from key players such as Front 242.
  Even 40 years on, EBM still lurks on the fringes of dance music. Irish
  producer Autumns is one name championing the industrial club sound through his
  stormy yet pumping hardware tracks and raucous live sets, which are all
  flailing limbs and swishing hair behind a tangle of wires. Since starting the
  project in 2013, he has put out a formidable 88 releases, including 13 albums;
  Basic Face is his latest. The bulk of the record follows the classic EBM
  formula: chugging loops strewn with sinister vocals and metallic sounds; in
  fact, White Walls sounds like an instrumental hit by scene legends Nitzer Ebb.
  The rhythms are beefy and catchy, elevated further by surprising elements such
  as the mutant-disco-style cowbells and angular post-punk riffs in A Grand Time
  to Witness Culture, or the sirens in Your Favourite Cowboy. Repetitive rather
  than progressive, the tracks are seemingly made for DJs and live sets, rather
  than home listening, which is strange given the cassette release. But this
  doesn’t feel like a fault of Autumns: they are intense and unrelenting, as any
  good EBM track should be. Only twice do we hear something less functional, and
  these moments work as good scene-setters, though not stand-alone tracks. On
  the intro No Gimmicks No Gigs, a disjointed vocal sample is interspersed with
  thrashes and fizzes that sound straight out of a forge. Your Tattoo is Shite,
  placed about halfway through the album, is a blistering, glitching whir of
  feedback – a disorienting experience, but one that only amplifies the punchy
  material around it. Also out this month Newport-based multi-instrumentalist
  and producer Memotone has built a reputation among DIY circles for his quietly
  cinematic electro-acoustic compositions. His latest album Smallest Things
  (released on World of Echo) is another lovely, evocative listen, full of
  sparse arrangements that are sometimes soaring, sometimes jittery. On Sound
  Bath (Dark Entries), Coatshek presents a dreamy, dimly lit collection of
  tracks inspired by an imaginary queer bath house. Expect ambient techno
  pitched low and slow – specifically at 107bpm, which the San Francisco
  producer deems the “optimal speed for sauna sex”. With every warm pad or deep,
  reverb-cloaked whisper, the record slowly builds tension, climaxing in the
  blissed-out 10-minute closer Eternal Lovers. Gush (Nettwerk), the latest
  record from Los Angles-based composer Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, is similarly
  intimate: an exploration of those warm, heady feelings that come with
  incipient romance, when, in her words, “the senses melt together”. Channelled
  through hushed vocals and bubbling electronica, it is suitably woozy: sensual
  and sometimes ecstatic.
