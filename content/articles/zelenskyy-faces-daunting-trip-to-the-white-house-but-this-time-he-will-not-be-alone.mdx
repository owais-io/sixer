  Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make his second visit to the White House on Monday
  with the daunting task of reversing the damage done to Ukraine’s security
  prospects by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. Zelenskyy will not,
  however, be alone as he was on his first trip to the White House in February
  when he was ambushed and humiliated by Donald Trump and the vice-president, JD
  Vance, who sought to bully him into capitulation to Moscow’s demands. This
  time the Ukrainian leader comes to Washington flanked by a dream team of
  European leaders, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Germany’s Friedrich Merz
  and France’s Emmanuel Macron, who combine economic and military clout with
  proven rapport with Trump. Their mission will be to use their individual and
  combined influence to coax the president out of the pro-Russian positions he
  adopted after just a couple of hours under Putin’s sway in the sub-Arctic on
  Friday. To do that, they will have to project a more convincing sense of
  resolve and common purpose than they have managed hitherto, argued Ben Rhodes,
  a former adviser to Barack Obama. “My advice would be to not capitulate to
  Trump,” Rhodes said. “He has grown all too accustomed to people he perceives
  as weaker bending to his will, which is something that Putin does not do …
  Zelenskyy cannot be expected to do this alone, as that’s what got him into
  that last mess in the Oval Office. Zelenskyy needs Europe. And the Europeans
  need to show a strength to stand up to Trump which they have not really shown
  yet.” Macron and Merz will accompany Zelenskyy on Monday as embodiments of the
  two pillars of Europe, the French-German axis that is at the core of the EU.
  Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, will be a reminder of
  Europe’s combined importance as an economic juggernaut. Trump struck a EU-US
  trade deal with her just three weeks ago in Scotland, and hailed the
  relationship as “the biggest trading partnership in the world”. Brett Bruen, a
  former White House director of global engagement, said the European leaders
  should focus on economics and use the White House meeting “as a chance to
  remind Trump how small Russia’s economy is vis-a-vis the EU and the UK and
  other western partners”. Italy’s prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, will be a
  useful bridge: a European far-rightwinger who Trump counts as a friend but who
  also supports Ukrainian sovereignty. The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb,
  represents a small European state but he is on Team Zelenskyy because he
  managed to establish an unexpectedly warm relationship with Trump. The Finn
  cultivated his access to the president by hastily polishing up his rusty
  golfing skills for an impromptu trip to Florida in March for a round with
  Trump, on the recommendation of the Republican senator Lindsey Graham. Stubb
  used the occasion to offer the perspective of Russia’s closest European
  neighbour, urging Trump not to trust Vladimir Putin. Starmer combines national
  clout and personal rapport in some measure. Trump has gone out of his way to
  emphasise their good relations, despite Starmer’s “liberal” outlook, and the
  president arguably has an incentive not to sour relations ahead of a state
  visit to the UK next month, an extravaganza in which Trump sets high store.
  Mark Rutte also brings the influence of high office, as Nato secretary
  general, with a proven track record of corralling Trump with honeyed words, at
  one point appointing him the “daddy” among world leaders, helping avoid any
  disastrous outbursts at the Nato summit in June. “A lot of people have learned
  the lessons of Trump, in terms of how you handle him,” said Kim Darroch, who
  was the UK ambassador to Washington in Trump’s first term. “There will be a
  lot of flattery. It’s tiresome but it’s necessary: it gets you to first base.
  You tell him how well he’s doing, how glad everyone is that he is leading the
  west to find a solution to the war. But then you get on to the substance.” The
  fact that all these leaders have cleared their diaries to fly to Washington at
  short notice is a measure of how alarmed they were by Friday’s Trump-Putin
  summit in Anchorage. The Russian president, wanted by the international
  criminal court for war crimes after his unprovoked full invasion of Ukraine,
  was feted with a red carpet and a personal round of applause from Trump, who
  allowed him to speak first after the truncated meeting and abruptly dropped
  his previous insistence on a ceasefire. Instead, the US president uncritically
  accepted Putin’s preference to move straight to a comprehensive peace deal,
  putting the onus on Ukraine to make territorial concessions. One diplomatic
  observer likened the prospect of Monday’s White House showdown to a football
  team coming out for a second half trailing 0-3 but with a raft of
  super-substitutes on the field. The first challenge will be staying together
  and sticking to the same talking points. “Put up a united front and speak from
  one set of points,” advised Ivo Daalder, a former US ambassador to Nato. “The
  goal is to get Trump to agree and side with them. But the message must be that
  their position is real, won’t change, and if Trump doesn’t agree they will
  pursue their path on their own.” “Trump won’t have the patience to listen to
  the same pitch a dozen times,” Darroch said. “So for the initial round they
  probably need to select a couple of European speakers alongside Zelenskyy:
  perhaps Rutte as secretary general of Nato and Macron as the senior European
  national leader. “My advice to Starmer would be to wait and see how the
  conversation goes,” Darroch added. “If it goes badly off-track, or gets a bit
  spiky, he can intervene to pull it back on course, or calm it down, or just
  try to build some bridges. Because the risk is that if Trump thinks that the
  whole exercise is basically about telling him he’s got it wrong, he could
  react badly or just close the discussion down.” On the way into the White
  House, Zelenskyy and his European backers can steel themselves with knowledge
  that not all is lost. The worst fear was that Trump would strike a deal with
  Putin in Alaska that would be presented as a fait accompli to Kyiv. That did
  not happen. Furthermore, they have potential allies inside the Trump
  administration. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, is a traditional
  Republican whose instincts towards Russia are hawkish, although he has a
  record of going along with the flow of the president’s impulses. On Sunday,
  Rubio gave the arriving delegation some hope, insisting to NBC that a
  ceasefire is “not off the table” and confirming that the US is interested in
  contributing to western security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a peace
  deal, acknowledging “it’s one of their fundamental demands is that if this war
  were to end, they have to make sure this never happens again”. The arrival of
  so many European luminaries in Washington is a sign of panic, in part, but
  also of united resolve. Arguably the only way the delegation could be
  strengthened would be with the inclusion of a Norwegian. Last week, Trump is
  reported to have cold-called the Norwegian finance minister (and former Nato
  secretary general) Jens Stoltenberg, catching him by surprise on his mobile
  while he was out on the street. The president is said to have pressed
  Stoltenberg on his obsession with winning a Nobel peace prize, an award
  decided by a Norwegian parliamentary-appointed committee. One of the cards
  Trump’s visitors will have in their hands on Monday is a reminder that cosying
  up to Putin is unlikely to get him the Nobel he craves. “Second-term Trump has
  his eye on his place in the history books,” Darroch said. “This is a point
  which needs to be put across delicately, but history will be kind to him if he
  delivers a fair peace in Ukraine; less so if he presses for a capitulation.”
