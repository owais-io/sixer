  Corey Bellemore doesn’t enjoy the same name recognition as Michael Phelps or
  Usain Bolt. He hasn’t amassed the earnings or brand endorsements of LeBron
  James or Lionel Messi. Yet over the past five years, this unassuming
  30-year-old Canadian has put together an extraordinary level of dominance that
  may be unprecedented in world sport, his achievements surpassing anything that
  his better known peers have achieved. Bellemore’s sport of choice is the beer
  mile, which involves downing four beers while running a mile really fast. He
  has won the Beer Mile World Classic, an international event which brings
  together the best of the best at drinking beer while also running a mile, for
  the past five years in a row, a staggering success in a hotly contested event.
  The rules of the beer mile are simple. Athletes must drink a beer, then run a
  lap of a 400m track. The competitors then drink another beer, and so on, until
  a mile is completed. The beer must be at least 355ml (12oz) in volume and no
  less than 5% ABV, with contestants choosing their own beer and whether to use
  cans or bottles. Vomiting is punished by running an extra lap. It’s a sport
  that is “equal parts gastric challenge and athletic endeavor”, Beermile.com
  says, and Bellemore is the best of the best. “From a young age – and this is
  not beer related – if I had to consume a bunch of liquid after running
  practice, I could finish the entire water bottle in a very short time.
  Electrolyte mix, Gatorade, whatever it was, I could down it as quick as I
  needed to get it in,” Bellemore said. “So I knew I could chug from a young
  age.” And chug he has, at Beer Mile events around the world, sending records
  toppling as he goes. At the Beer Mile World Classic in Portugal, in late July,
  Bellemore broke his own world record for the beer mile, setting a time of four
  minutes 27.1 seconds. For reference, the fastest ever mile time is 3:43.13,
  set by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco in 1999. El Guerrouj did not drink four
  beers during his run. Despite his success, Bellemore was not always destined
  to be the titan of the beer mile. He was a competitive runner at university,
  specializing in the 800m and 1500m, and has represented Canada in
  international athletics events, but only discovered the beer mile when he was
  21 years old. It’s a remarkable feat in an era when many sportspeople begin
  training for their sports as children. “I didn’t go searching for it. It kind
  of found me,” Bellemore said. He tried the beer mile in 2016 just for a bit of
  fun, with his twin brother monitoring his times and beer consumption and a
  friend filming the endeavor. In Bellemore’s first attempt he beat the world
  record – albeit unofficially – and after the footage was uploaded to YouTube,
  Bellemore’s journey began. “I woke up the next morning to a message from an
  account called Beer Mile World Classic,” Bellemore said. “They just happened
  to be hosting a competition in London, England, that weekend. They said:
  ‘We’ll pay for your flight. We’ll pay for your trip. Do you think you can get
  on a flight tonight and come here for this weekend?’” He could. Jet-lagged and
  with only one beer mile experience behind him, Bellemore won the Beer Mile
  World Classic, beating England’s Dale King Clutterbuck by 15 seconds.
  Bellemore did not compete in the 2017 race, but he returned in 2018, when he
  lost to Clutterbuck in heartbreaking fashion, as Bellemore was judged not to
  have drunk all of his beer. He won again in 2019 before missing the race in
  2020, but has won every year since then – five in a row. Undisputedly the
  world’s best at running a mile while drinking beer, Bellemore holds the
  overall world record as well as the record for using canned beer and also has
  the best time in the non-alcoholic beer mile. The world classic in 2023
  provided exceptional sporting drama, when Bellemore’s shoe came off in the
  first few yards of the race. With fans on the edge of their seats, Bellemore
  stormed into the lead anyway, wearing just one shoe as he rocketed around the
  track to claim another title. Despite his unparalleled success, Bellemore has
  eschewed the limelight. He doesn’t want to be known as just a beer drinker: he
  focuses his training almost exclusively on the running aspect of the beer mile
  and remains a talented athlete – later this year he will begin competing
  professionally in the triathlon. “It took me a long time to kind of
  acknowledge and I sort of just own that I do these things,” he said. “I think
  a lot of people get a misrepresentation of who I am, of what I’m about, what I
  do. I think a lot of people think maybe I’m a booze bag, maybe a bad influence
  because I’m doing these races. “Obviously, it’s probably not the best for your
  body if you’re doing these continuously. But I only do these once or twice a
  year, and with the opportunities it brings, it’s a no-brainer for me. I’ve met
  some phenomenal people and been to some amazing places. That’s why I do it.”
