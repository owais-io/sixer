  About 5% of common Australian wild birds including kookaburras and lorikeets
  could have undergone a “sex reversal” where their genetic sex does not match
  their reproductive organs, according to a new study. The study is thought to
  be the first to find widespread sex reversal across multiple wild bird
  species, but the cause of the phenomenon is not yet known. The results suggest
  sex reversal is more common in wild birds than previously thought, and have
  raised concerns about the potential impact of chemicals that can disrupt
  hormones in animals. Researchers tested 480 birds across five common species
  that had died after being admitted to wildlife hospitals in south-east
  Queensland. Researchers first used a DNA test to determine a bird’s genetic
  sex; in birds, males have a pair of Z chromosomes and females have one Z and
  one W. But after dissecting the birds, they found a mismatch between the DNA
  test and the reproductive organs of 24 of the birds. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email Associate Prof Dominique Potvin, a co-author of the research at the
  University of the Sunshine Coast, said the team were deeply sceptical when the
  results first came in. “I was thinking, is this right?” she said. “So we
  rechecked, and rechecked and rechecked. And then we were thinking, ‘Oh my
  God’.” Potvin said she had revealed the results to ornithologist friends.
  “They were mind-blown,” she said. Concern sex reversal may skew data Almost
  all of the “sex discordant” birds were genetically female but had male
  reproductive organs, found the research, published in the Royal Society
  journal Biology Letters. In one case, a kookaburra that was genetically male
  had a stretched oviduct – the passageway for an egg – that suggested “recent
  egg production”, Potvin said. Two genetically female crested pigeons had both
  testicular and ovarian reproductive structures, the research found. Other
  birds tested were rainbow lorikeets, scaly-breasted lorikeets and Australian
  magpies. The lowest levels of sex reversal was 3%, found in Australian
  magpies, and the highest was 6.3% in crested pigeons. Dr Clancy Hall, the lead
  author of the research, also at the University of the Sunshine Coast, said
  sex-reversed birds could affect reproductive success that should raise
  concerns about the impact on threatened species. She said: “This can lead to
  skewed sex ratios, reduced population sizes, altered mate preferences, and
  even population decline. “The ability to unequivocally identify the sex and
  reproductive status of individuals is crucial across many fields of study.”
  Experts say chemicals may be to blame The causes of the sex reversals were
  unclear, but one factor could be contact with chemicals in the environment.
  Sex reversal is known to occur in some molluscs, fish, amphibians and reptiles
  and can occur naturally or be influenced by chemicals that can affect an
  animal’s hormones – known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Prof Kate
  Buchanan, who studies the evolutionary biology of wild birds at Deakin
  University but was not involved in the study, said because the default sex of
  birds was female, it was not surprising that most of the sex reversal affects
  were in the direction of female to male. She said: “The most likely
  explanation of the masculinisation is some environmental stimulation, probably
  anthropogenic chemicals.” Buchanan has been part of research that has found
  EDCs in insects that develop in sewage treatment works and are food for some
  birds, as well as a study that found male European starlings exposed to the
  chemicals developed longer and more complex songs, but had a damaged immune
  system. She said even if the masculinisation of affected birds was reversible
  in their lifetime, “it would probably knock them out of being reproductive”.
  Dr Clare Holleley is the head of vertebrate collections at the Australian
  government science agency the CSIRO and has studied sex reversal in lizards.
  “What’s doing this is now the big question,” she said. While a cause could be
  natural (for example, sex reversal in lizards can be triggered by temperature
  changes), Holleley said it was likely “something else is going on”. “If sex
  determination gets disrupted then something has to push you off track. The
  most likely [cause] is endocrine-disrupting chemicals.” Dr Golo Maurer, the
  director of conservation strategy at BirdLife Australia, said the research was
  likely to cause a stir in the ornithological field. He said the presence of
  EDCs and the potential impacts was a “huge concern” given the other crises
  facing birds, from climate change to habitat clearance and plastic pollution.
  Some experts were cautious about extrapolating the results to the wider
  population of wild birds, because the birds were not a random sample but had
  been admitted to hospitals.
