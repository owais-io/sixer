  The director James Cameron has warned that the use of artificial intelligence
  in a global arms race could lead to the kind of dystopia fictionalised in his
  Terminator franchise. Speaking to Rolling Stone to promote the publication of
  Ghosts of Hiroshima, an account of the first atomic bombing by bestselling
  author Charles Pellegrino which Cameron intends to adapt for the big screen,
  the film-maker behind three of the four highest-grossing films of all time
  (Titanic and the first two Avatar films), said that although he relies on AI
  professionally, he remains concerned about what might happen if it was
  leveraged with nihilistic intent. “I do think there’s still a danger of a
  Terminator-style apocalypse where you put AI together with weapons systems,
  even up to the level of nuclear weapon systems, nuclear defence counterstrike,
  all that stuff,” Cameron said. “Because the theatre of operations is so rapid,
  the decision windows are so fast, it would take a super-intelligence to be
  able to process it, and maybe we’ll be smart and keep a human in the loop.
  “But humans are fallible, and there have been a lot of mistakes made that have
  put us right on the brink of international incidents that could have led to
  nuclear war. So I don’t know.” He added: “I feel like we’re at this cusp in
  human development where you’ve got the three existential threats: climate and
  our overall degradation of the natural world, nuclear weapons, and
  super-intelligence. They’re all sort of manifesting and peaking at the same
  time. Maybe the super-intelligence is the answer.” Cameron’s original 1984
  Terminator film starring Arnold Schwarzenegger is set in a world in which
  humanity is ruled by an artificially intelligent defence network called
  Skynet. Cameron’s films, Avatar in particular, are actively engaged with AI in
  their execution, and the director has been positive about how the technology
  could help reduce production costs. Last September, he joined the board of
  directors of Stability AI and earlier this year said the future of blockbuster
  film-making hinges on being able to “cut the cost of [VFX] in half”. He
  clarified that he hoped such cost-cutting would come not from human layoffs
  but speed acceleration. However, Cameron has also expressed scepticism about
  the capacity of AI to replace screenwriters. In 2023, he said: “I just don’t
  personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what
  other embodied minds have said – about the life that they’ve had, about love,
  about lying, about fear, about mortality – and just put it all together into a
  word salad and then regurgitate it … I don’t believe that’s ever going to have
  something that’s going to move an audience. You have to be human to write
  that.”
