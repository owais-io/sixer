  crisis

  Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has announced a 10-point plan to
  prepare the country for the climate emergency, warning: “If we don’t want to
  bequeath our children a Spain that’s grey from fire and flames, or a Spain
  that’s brown from floods, then we need a Spain that’s greener.” Sánchez said
  August’s heatwave-fuelled wildfires – which killed four people, burned through
  an area six times the size of Ibiza and required “the biggest human and
  technical deployment” ever seen in Spain – showed that immediate action must
  be taken to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis. He said waiting any
  longer would be dangerous and expensive, and he criticised those who deny the
  realities of global heating in Spain. Over the past five years, he said, the
  climate emergency had caused more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse
  €32bn (£28bn) in material losses. “We need to mobilise as a society against
  climate change, which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies,” he said.
  “Climate change kills. It kills. And that’s why we have to be aware of
  everything it represents in terms of insecurity and in terms of the risks it
  poses to our lives. “The climate change denial that’s coming from an important
  part [of society] – and which is growing as a result of the lies spread on
  social networks by some members of our political class – is as
  incomprehensible as it is worrying.” He proposed a series of initiatives
  including a state civil protection agency to coordinate crisis responses, a
  network of climate refuges across the country and a rethink of forest
  management and land use. Only by acting now, he said, could the country hope
  to avert similar disasters or reduce their impacts. “The biggest opportunity
  we have right now is to avoid this tragedy – and to do that, we need to do as
  a US president once advised when he said that the moment to fix your roof is
  when the sun’s shining and not when it’s raining,” he said. “I think he was
  right because these sixth-generation fires that have burned through more than
  300,000 hectares in our country aren’t put out in summer; they’re put out in
  winter and in autumn. They’re put out by working all year.” Other measures in
  the socialist-led government’s “state pact to address the climate emergency”
  include funds to prepare for, and rebuild after, climate-related disasters,
  improvements to firefighting capacity, a plan to increase water resilience in
  the face of floods and droughts, and initiatives to fight rural depopulation
  and thus help keep the land clear of combustible material. Sánchez said
  farming would also play an important role in fighting the climate crisis,
  pointing to the benefits of extensive agriculture, careful grazing and
  efficient irrigation. The final two measures are promoting a “civic culture of
  prevention and reaction” and accelerating the green transition. The plan will
  be approved in cabinet on Tuesday and put out for public consultation.
