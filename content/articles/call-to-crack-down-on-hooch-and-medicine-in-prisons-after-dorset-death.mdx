  Ministers should draw up a specific policy to reduce inmate access to
  illicitly brewed alcohol and medication, a coroner has said, after the death
  of a vulnerable prisoner. An inquest jury found last month that Sheldon Jeans,
  who was discovered dead in his cell at HMP Guys Marsh in November 2022, had
  died as a result of consuming illegal alcohol and four different medications
  that had not been prescribed to him, recording death by misadventure. Rachael
  Griffin, the senior Dorset coroner, issued a prevention of future deaths (PFD)
  report in response to findings at the inquest, highlighting national policy
  and guidance relating to the handling of hooch and medication in prisons as
  areas for concern. “In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could
  occur unless action is taken … There is a lack of national policy, and local
  guidance at HMP Guys Marsh, to inform staff working in prisons of the dangers
  of illicitly brewed alcohol, also known as hooch,” she wrote. The report has
  been sent to the Department of Health and Social Care, HM Prison and Probation
  Service, HMP Guys Marsh, and Oxleas NHS foundation trust, requesting a
  response by 19 September 2025 detailing actions to be taken and a timetable
  for that action. Jeans, 32, from Portsmouth, had a history of mental health
  issues and was anxious about the impending outcome of a parole hearing, a jury
  at Dorset coroner’s court in Bournemouth heard. In the report, the coroner
  drew attention to evidence given about the continual problem in prison of
  hooch, which is illicitly brewed from substances legitimately available to
  prisoners. In September 2022, shortly before Jeans’s death, 215.5 litres of it
  was seized at HMP Guys Marsh. Hooch was described during the inquest as a
  dangerous substance, and has sedative effects which can be increased when
  consumed alongside certain medications. The coroner said that while policies
  were in place concerning the possession and use of illicit substances in
  prisons, these focused on drugs or medication and “remain silent in relation
  to alcohol”. The coroner also raised concerns about prisoners having access to
  prescription medication that was not prescribed to them. Jeans had taken four
  different types of medication, none of which had been prescribed to him,
  alongside consuming hooch. At the inquest, the jury concluded that the
  substances in isolation would not have been fatal, but taken together caused a
  sedative effect which, combined with Jeans’s body posture, led to respiratory
  depression. At the inquest, it was heard that prescription medication at HMP
  Guys Marsh can either be taken under supervision, or a prisoner is provided
  with the medication for them to keep and take in their cells. While it is not
  known how Jeans accessed the medication he consumed, evidence was provided at
  the inquest about how prisoners are able to access each other’s cells during
  states of unlock – such as during meal collection times. Medication was shown
  to be left around cells and in unsecured plastic containers, despite lockable
  cupboards being available. After the inquest, the jury concluded that Jeans’s
  death had been by misadventure, and that while he had deliberately taken the
  substances, he had not intended to end his life. A Ministry of Justice
  spokesperson said: “We will carefully consider the coroner’s findings and will
  respond to the report in due course.” Jeans was found to have taken
  pregabalin, used to treat epilepsy and anxiety, and the antidepressant
  mirtazapine. Jeans also took the opioid painkiller dihydrocodeine and
  quetiapine, which is used to treat mental health conditions. Benjamin Burrows,
  a partner with the law firm Leigh Day, who represents Jeans’s family, said:
  “Our hope is that steps are taken in prisons across the country, not just HMP
  Guys Marsh, to address these issues and to safeguard against this kind of
  tragic death occurring again.”
