  In wartime, demonstrations in Ukraine can never be more than a peaceful
  protest

  Once a decade, Ukraine has a moment in which street protests redefine the
  country’s political direction. The Orange revolution of 2004; the Maidan
  revolution of 2014; and now, over the past 10 days, the first major wave of
  protest since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion. A series of
  unexpectedly boisterous and well-attended demonstrations forced Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy to execute a swift U-turn on his decision to scrap the independence
  of two anti-corruption bodies. On Thursday, MPs reversed the contentious
  changes they had adopted a week previously. Outside the parliament building,
  crowds whooped and cheered as the result of the vote was announced. The size,
  scope and demands of this latest protest movement have been much more modest
  than those of its revolutionary predecessors, but the spectacle has been no
  less remarkable, given the context of full-scale war in which it has taken
  place. The final, celebratory gathering came only hours after the latest
  massive Russian airstrike had hit Kyiv, killing at least 31 people including
  five children. Hardly anyone had managed a good night’s sleep before arriving
  at parliament armed with banners and high spirits. This wartime context to a
  large extent inspired the protests: a common sentiment that when people are
  laying down their lives for the country on the frontline, the government has
  to live up to a certain set of values. But it also limited their scope. There
  was none of the revolutionary enthusiasm of Maidan present here; instead,
  there was a sober acknowledgement that all-out political unrest would only
  play into Russia’s hands. “There were some people chanting for impeachment and
  the vast majority of others said, ‘Shut up, we do not undermine the legitimacy
  of the president, what happened is that the legitimate president made a
  mistake,’” said Inna Sovsun, an MP from the opposition Holos party who
  attended several protests. Dmytro Koziatynskyi, whose post on social media
  provided the initial spark for the protest, dismissed any comparisons to
  Maidan for exactly this reason. “Even if they don’t pass the law, this will
  never become anything other than a peaceful protest,” he said, in an interview
  before the parliamentary vote. Koziatynskyi was a masters student in the Czech
  Republic before returning to Ukraine after the full-scale invasion in 2022 and
  signing up to become a combat medic. After three years on various parts of the
  frontline, he left the army in May and now works for an NGO. When he saw the
  news last week that parliament had rushed through a law curtailing the
  independence of two bodies specially designed to go after high-level
  corruption, he found it “insulting”, he said. “People are not fighting so that
  our government can do some crazy stuff, that destroys all our achievements
  since 2014,” he said. He penned an angry post on social media calling on
  people to protest against the new law. He expected “maximum 100 people, mostly
  friends and acquaintances” to join the protest. By the second night there were
  about 10,000 people outside the Ivan Franko theatre, the nearest point to the
  presidential office that is accessible to the public. Most of those who came
  out were young – this has been a protest wave dominated by gen Z, with friends
  competing for the wittiest slogan or meme reference on their handwritten
  placards. On Wednesday evening, a man leading the singing of the Ukrainian
  national anthem through a loudspeaker was holding a sign that bore a single
  word: “Cringe”. Suddenly, the fate of two relatively small institutions – the
  national anti-corruption bureau, known as Nabu, and the specialised
  anti-corruption prosecutor’s office, Sapo – had become the issue of the day
  among Ukrainian teenagers. Nabu and Sapo were established after the Maidan
  revolution as part of a drive against the long-running scourge of corruption
  in Ukraine, financed partly with US money. Some western observers agree that
  there are problems with Nabu and Sapo: too many cases opened and not enough of
  them brought to a conclusion, for one. In theory, some streamlining would make
  sense; in practice, Zelenskyy’s move looked a lot like bringing independent
  investigators under political control. With the Trump administration no longer
  pushing an anti-corruption agenda, and Europe on summer holidays, Zelenskyy’s
  team appears to have felt they could push the bill through quickly, without
  anyone paying much attention. That might have been the case were it not for
  the protests. But the images of thousands of young people demanding the law’s
  repeal forced European politicians to take a stand, and several leaders spoke
  privately to Zelenskyy to tell him he needed to find a way out of the
  self-inflicted mess. “This became a major breach of trust. It’s problematic
  both from an EU accession point of view and in that it makes it much harder
  for friends of Ukraine to continue making the case that the country needs
  support,” said one diplomatic source in Kyiv. Zelenskyy’s response was swift
  and decisive, even if somewhat embarrassing for the MPs of his Servant of the
  People party, who were instructed to vote against the very thing they had been
  ordered to vote for the previous week. Now that the status quo has been
  re-established, there are two very different readings of the whole episode.
  One sees a leader using wartime powers to try to stifle independent
  institutions, too out of touch to predict the obvious backlash. Another
  reflects on how, even in wartime, Ukrainian society is still capable of
  expressing democratic sentiment, and its leaders still able to react swiftly
  to it. Koziatynskyi, whose post started off the protest wave, leans towards
  the second view. “The protests showed that Ukrainian democracy is as strong as
  possible in times of a full-scale war, and our society is mature enough to
  have a dialogue with the government, and the government is able to listen,” he
  said. Zelenskyy’s five-year presidential term should have ended last year, but
  almost all Ukrainians, including his fiercest opponents, agree that elections
  are both legally and technically impossible during wartime. With Russia’s
  nightly attacks continuing, and a hope that Donald Trump might finally start
  getting tougher on Russia, that consensus has not changed. Nobody wants
  upheaval, but the outburst of protest may yet change the political atmosphere.
  “Legally, everything will go back to how it was; politically, it’s more
  complicated,” said Sovsun. “It’s unpredictable what this might have done to
  Ukrainian society. We have basically lifted the unspoken rule that we don’t
  protest during martial law.”
