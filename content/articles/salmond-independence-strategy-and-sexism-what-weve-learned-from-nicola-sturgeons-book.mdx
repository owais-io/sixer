  Nicola Sturgeon’s much-anticipated political memoir Frankly is now on sale
  after a cascade of hype and teasing interviews. The once stratospherically
  popular Scottish Nationalist leader, who led her party to repeated electoral
  success before becoming by her own admission a polarising force in Scottish
  politics, reflects on her working-class upbringing and the “burning sense of
  destiny” that drove her. As Scotland’s first female first minister, she
  participated in some of the most significant moments of modern political
  history – the independence referendum, the Brexit vote and its aftermath, and
  the Covid pandemic. But her revelations have already inflamed many of the
  divisions she discusses in the book. So what have we learned? Her relationship
  with Alex Salmond Sturgeon’s political partnership with her predecessor as
  first minister, Alex Salmond, dominates the memoir far more than any of her
  romantic relationships. She describes tensions that existed between them long
  before their catastrophic falling out over her government’s handling of sexual
  harassment complaints against him. Salmond later stood trial and was cleared
  of all 13 charges, although a pattern of bullying and inappropriate behaviour
  towards younger female staff emerged in court. Asked directly in
  pre-publication interviews if she had known about Salmond’s alleged behaviour,
  she insisted she had not, telling Sam Baker on The Shift podcast: “I have
  searched my own soul over this so many times.” The memoir includes a forensic
  deconstruction of the conspiracy theory espoused by Salmond before his death
  last autumn that the allegations were confected by Sturgeon’s inner circle –
  “he was determined to destroy me,” she writes – and she includes the startling
  suggestion that Salmond himself may have leaked the initial story to the Daily
  Record. Her treatment of Salmond has drawn immediate fire from his allies. The
  former SNP MP Joanna Cherry accused Sturgeon of “impugning a dead man who
  cannot defend himself” while others have demanded a retraction and an apology
  to his widow, Moira. David Clegg, the journalist who broke the story after
  receiving an anonymous envelope containing details of the harassment
  investigation, described Sturgeon’s allegation as “a conspiracy theory too
  far”. He told the BBC: “It shows the level of suspicion and the deep rift that
  had formed between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon prior to his death.”
  Gender recognition Writing about the bruising parliamentary passage of her
  flagship gender recognition measures, aimed at making it easier for a trans
  person to change their legal sex, Sturgeon uses far more ameliorative language
  than she has done before. She admits she should have considered pausing the
  legislation as the debate around it became increasingly toxic, although she
  says she still “fervently believes” that the rights of women and the interests
  of trans people are not irreconcilable. She writes how she was “blindsided”
  when the case of the double rapist Adam Graham, who was initially sent to a
  female prison after self-identifying as a woman called Isla Bryson, came to
  light and “gave a human face to fears that until then had been abstract for
  most people”. She accepts she “lost the dressing room” when she was unable to
  answer directly whether Bryson was a woman. In interviews now she remains
  evasive on that question, saying someone who commits a crime of such gravity
  “forfeits their right” to change gender, and explains that “anything I say
  about Isla Bryson will immediately be taken and transferred to every trans
  person”. The campaign group For Women Scotland, which opposed the measures,
  has accused Sturgeon of belatedly displaying “retro reasonableness … in order
  to promote her book”. Operation Branchform Sturgeon is legally constrained in
  what she can write about Operation Branchform, the Police Scotland
  investigation into the SNP’s finances, while her husband, Peter Murrell, a
  former party chief executive from whom she is now separated, awaits trial for
  embezzlement. But she describes feeling as if she had “fallen into the plot of
  a dystopian novel” when the police knocked on her door to arrest Murrell in
  April 2023 and she was arrested herself a few months later. “I was devastated,
  mortified, confused and terrified,” she says. And although she insists she
  knew nothing of the alleged embezzlement, she writes of the shame she felt at
  how others would interpret events. “‘No smoke without fire’ is a strong human
  instinct,” she writes. Independence In another striking moment of candour,
  Sturgeon describes having a panic attack “on the floor of my home office,
  crying and struggling to breathe” as she struggled to edit the Scottish
  government’s white paper on independence. The 2014 campaign was “like trying
  to push a boulder up hill”, she writes, and she is particularly critical of
  what she describes as biased and London-centric media coverage. She assesses
  her later strategy critically and accepts she was “probably wrong” to try to
  cast the 2024 general election as a de facto independence referendum – but
  predicts that “within 20 years … the UK in its current form will no longer
  exist”. Personal relationships In a line pored over by interviewers, she
  writes: “I have never considered sexuality, my own included, to be binary.”
  Pressed on what she meant by this, Sturgeon – who has been the subject of
  prurient and often lesbophobic speculation in the past – said she was not
  intending “some big revelation” and that she hoped in future her relationships
  would remain private matters. On the breakup of her marriage, she writes that
  the strain of the police investigation was “impossible to bear”. She also
  writes with graphic honesty about the gruelling miscarriage she went through
  aged 40, and shares the name she had chosen for the baby, whom she believed
  would be a girl, Isla. Toll of Covid The title of the memoir, Frankly, raised
  some eyebrows when it was announced considering the repeated criticisms of
  Sturgeon’s government for its lack of transparency, in particular during the
  Covid pandemic. Evidence to the UK Covid inquiry revealed mass deletions of
  WhatsApp messages by senior Scottish government figures and unminuted crisis
  meetings. Sturgeon reveals she sought counselling for the first time in her
  life when she came “perilously close to a breakdown” after giving evidence to
  the inquiry – where she was confronted with a “devastating” accusation that
  she had been self-serving and politically motivated. Sexism and self-criticism
  Sturgeon writes of the misogyny and sexism she faced – “so endemic that I
  didn’t always recognise it as such” – and the pressures she put on herself.
  “Living up to the honour of being the first female incumbent of my office
  became almost an obsession,” she says. She sets out how a male MSP bullied her
  during her first term at Holyrood, spreading a “horrible” rumour that she had
  injured a boyfriend during oral sex and giving her the nickname “gnasher”. She
  also writes about how she was accompanied by almost crippling self-doubt, but
  she told Baker on The Shift that she believed her lack of confidence became
  her “superpower” as it fuelled her ferocious work ethic and determination to
  succeed. London calling? Sturgeon says at the conclusion of her memoir that
  she is more content and more resilient than she has ever been, and that the
  process of writing has been “a form of therapy in action … amidst a constant
  cacophony of voices claiming to know me better than I do myself”. She has
  hinted she may leave Scotland for a time, telling a BBC News podcast: “This
  may shock many people to hear, but I love London.” Frankly by Nicola Sturgeon
  (Pan Macmillan, £28). To order a copy for £23.80 go to guardianbookshop.com.
