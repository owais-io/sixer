  Survivors of stalking, campaigners for women’s safety and heads of law
  enforcement have raised concerns over continuing failings by police in England
  and Wales to tackle perpetrators and protect victims. They warn that while
  some forces are doing innovative work on stalking, others are not improving
  quickly enough, leading to a “patchwork” service and victims facing a
  “postcode lottery”. The concerns come as courts deal with two high-profile
  stalking cases. This week a 71-year-old man from Berkshire, Phil Appleton, was
  ordered not to contact the actor Anna Friel or go to the area where she lives
  after admitting to stalking her. Next week a 39-year-old man from West Sussex,
  Rob Keating, will be sentenced for stalking after threatening to kidnap an
  American travel influencer and travelling to her home in Bali with rope in his
  suitcase. In September 2024, after an investigation led by the Independent
  Office for Police Conduct, 15 recommendations over stalking were made to heads
  of police. Almost a year on, a report by the National Police Chiefs’ Council
  (NPCC) highlights good practice by some forces, such as “stalking clinics”
  established by West Midlands police in which officers can seek advice and
  guidance about stalking investigations, and sessions run by Sussex police in
  which potential victims can have their phone “swept” for malicious
  applications or malware used by stalkers. But the report also reveals a string
  of problems and concludes that victims receive a different level of support
  depending on what part of England and Wales they live in. Rhianon Bragg, who
  was stalked and held hostage at gunpoint by her ex-partner Gareth Wyn Jones,
  said there were “massive and unacceptable gaps”. She said: “Tackling stalking
  needs to be invested in, targeted, by the government, by police and crime
  commissioners and by the chief constables. “If you’d experienced what I have
  as a victim of near-fatal stalking – super-high anxiety, psychological trauma,
  deep and long-lasting damage caused to my family and me by a stalker – then
  you would feel passionate about these recommendations being fully implemented
  by all police forces, supported by government.” The NPCC report concludes that
  some forces’ record management systems still do not allow them to effectively
  note cases of stalking when a more serious crime such as rape or murder has
  also been committed. In some instances, interim solutions have been developed
  but not all forces have taken them up. The report says there has been
  “progress” in training on stalking but “gaps” still exist. According to the
  latest figures available, 89,000 of the 149,000 officers in England and Wales
  have completed the College of Policing e-learning packages on stalking. Some
  forces have incorporated stalking training into existing domestic abuse
  training, despite the National Stalking Helpline recording almost half of its
  callers as being targeted by someone who was not a current or ex-partner.
  Several forces have admitted to a lack of work on understanding demographic or
  cultural factors at play that could lead to an increased risk of stalking in
  certain areas. The report says dedicated coordinator roles are being carried
  out by officers and staff in addition to their day-to-day roles and highlights
  that police are struggling to “keep pace with new criminal applications of
  technology”. Suky Bhaker, the CEO of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which made the
  super-complaint that led to the IOPC-led investigation, said: “While we
  appreciate the strain on police budgets, we are concerned that the allocation
  of existing resources continues to deprioritise stalking, despite the NPCC’s
  own strategic risk assessment stating that stalking and harassment accounts
  for 43% of all violence against women and girls recorded by police.” In its
  response to the NPCC report, the trust added: “From crime-recording data and
  training delivery to risk assessments and problem profiles, major
  inconsistencies across forces will only deepen the existing patchwork of
  service provision for stalking victims across England and Wales.” Paladin
  National Stalking Advocacy Service, which assists high-risk victims of
  stalking, said there had been positive steps from some forces and it had
  received requests for help in training. But a spokesperson for the charity
  said: “The response for stalking victims is still a postcode lottery. A
  barrier in some instances is resources and funding and Paladin is still
  calling for more resources and funding nationally to support and resource
  stalking cases.” The Alice Ruggles Trust said there had been progress but
  added: “We would like to see a consistent approach across all force areas.”
  The campaign group Women Against Rape said: “Stalking most often occurs when
  men, often ex-partners, want a sexual relationship and won’t take no for an
  answer. “As with domestic violence, women’s reports of stalking are not taken
  seriously enough. Over 1,000 police officers have been accused of domestic
  violence in the last three years – but just 69 constables were sacked or quit.
  Can we expect such police to arrest stalkers and other abusive men?” The
  victims’ commissioner, Helen Newlove, said: “Stalking ruins lives, and while
  improvements are being made, the response victims receive still depends far
  too much on where they live. Meanwhile, the support services victims rely on
  to cope and recover are facing a crisis, as funding is reduced. “It is
  important that all victims feel safe – they also need access to dedicated
  frontline support wherever they live. Only then will perpetrators be stopped,
  and victims have the safety and support they deserve.”
