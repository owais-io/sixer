  A former cabinet minister has said the UK government is “digging itself into a
  hole” over Palestine Action and fellow Labour peers and MPs were regretting
  voting to ban the group. The warning by Peter Hain, who opposed proscription,
  came as a Labour backbencher who supported it said the issue would arise again
  when parliament returned in September. Lord Hain, who was a leader of the
  anti-apartheid movement and the Anti-Nazi League in Britain during the 1970s
  and 1980s, was lacerating about the response to recent protests in support of
  Palestine Action. “It will end in tears for the government,” he said. “We are
  seeing retired magistrates, retired and serving doctors and all sorts of
  people being arrested and now effectively being equated with terrorists such
  as al-Qaida, which is absolutely wrong.” He said if a legal challenge to the
  proscription was successful, it “would be a mercy to all concerned, including
  the government”. The peer was one of three Labour members of the Lords to vote
  against banning the group in July. Lord John Hendy, the barrister and
  employment law expert, and Frances O’Grady, the former TUC general secretary,
  also opposed the move, as did 10 Labour MPs. “It’s going to get worse [for the
  government] because I don’t see people from that ‘middle Britain’ background
  who have joined these protests in such large numbers to suddenly decide that
  all is OK,” he said. “In fact, I think more are going to come out and face
  arrest because the approach to Palestine Action is contrary to every form of
  peaceful protest in British history, whether that’s the chartists and
  suffragettes or anti-apartheid and anti-fascist protesters.” The government
  has come under pressure to justify the detention of 532 people arrested over
  the weekend under the Terrorism Act – half of whom were 60 or older – on
  suspicion of showing support for Palestine Action. He cited his experience as
  a secretary of state for Northern Ireland and cabinet minister to challenge
  the equation of the group with terrorists. “There is a battery of other crimes
  that could be applied to Palestine Action but terrorism is not one of them,
  while you also devalue the charge of terrorism by equating it with the
  protests we have seen,” Hain said. “I … worked with the intelligence services
  and others to stop dissident IRA groups from killing. I have signed warrants
  to stop other real terrorists, Islamist terrorists, bombing London. So I am
  not soft on terrorism. But I am a strong believer that you have to know what
  it looks like.” Hain said that a lot of Labour MPs and peers were now having
  “second thoughts” about proscribing Palestine Action. On Monday, a Downing
  Street spokesperson said the group was “a violent organisation that has
  committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage”. The home
  secretary, Yvette Cooper, told the BBC that Palestine Action “is not a
  non-violent organisation” and claimed that court restrictions meant people
  “don’t know the full nature of this organisation”. Labour backbencher Stella
  Creasy said in a video posted on Instagram on Tuesday that MPs who had voted
  for proscription “need to be clearer about the basis for that”. But she said
  this was more complicated than it should be because the evidence presented to
  MPs about the alleged use of violence was part and parcel of court cases and
  could not be used in parliamentary debates. “The presence of violence in our
  politics can’t be ignored and it needs legislation that can balance the danger
  this presents with defending debate for all concerned so clear we need to work
  on this further when parliament returns,” she said. Creasy also called for
  more “consistency” about tackling violence and intimidation, which she said
  was on the rise and should cause the government to consider extending bans to
  some far-right groups seeking to exploit protests against hotels housing
  asylum seekers.
