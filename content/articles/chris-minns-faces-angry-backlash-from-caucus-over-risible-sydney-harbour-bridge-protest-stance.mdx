  The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, faces an angry backlash from within
  his Labor caucus when it meets on Tuesday over his stance on the pro-Palestine
  march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Members are planning to move a motion
  in caucus condemning the conditions in Gaza and endorsing the right to
  protest. The march for Palestine went ahead on Sunday after the NSW supreme
  court overturned a decision by police to refuse a permit to march on the
  bridge on public safety grounds. NSW police said initial estimates put the
  crowd at 90,000, while rally organisers Palestine Action Group estimated the
  figure was closer to 300,000. Several Labor state MPs, including the energy
  minister, Penny Sharpe, and fellow frontbencher Jihad Dib joined the protest.
  Several other NSW Labor MPs, including Stephen Lawrence, Lynda Voltz and Sarah
  Kaine were at the front of the march, along with the former NSW premier Bob
  Carr. Minns’ stance on protests has drawn sharp criticism from members of his
  own right faction as well as from the soft left, who are increasingly dismayed
  that Minns appears to be more attuned to the News Corp media and talkback
  radio than his own party. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “There’s a sense
  that our policy positions are at the most conservative end of the spectrum.
  The audience of 2GB are never, ever going to vote for us,” a member of the
  right faction told Guardian Australia, on the condition anonymity. “I would
  just like a bit more Labor in my life,” they said. Until now, parliamentary
  MPs from the hard left faction who backed Minns into the leadership have been
  largely silent over his clampdown on protests and other law and order issues,
  such as changes to bail laws and children. The divergent approaches within the
  factions are causing tensions within Minns’ team. “They’ve been completely
  missing in action,” said one right faction member talking about the left.
  Another right faction MP said: “They haven’t come out on any progressive
  issues. It’s been us – the right – and some of the soft left that have been
  raising it, and now the base is really unhappy.” Mark Morey, the secretary of
  Unions NSW, said: “When there’s a strong public hunger to protest against
  violence and humanitarian crises, the government’s role should be to
  facilitate peaceful expression, not obstruct it.” “Yesterday’s massive turnout
  shows that working people across Sydney are deeply concerned about Gaza, and
  political leaders should listen rather than look for ways to silence them,” he
  said. “The premier’s attempt to block this peaceful demonstration was a
  concerning overreach that the supreme court rightly rejected.” Speaking on
  Monday, Minns said he did not regret his opposition to the protest march and
  it was his job to “be on the side of public safety”. “I accept that there’s a
  huge groundswell. It’s a difficult one for the government. We have to balance
  public safety and the public’s right to protest … alongside running a big city
  like Sydney. Ultimately, my job is to be on the side of public safety,” he
  said. The characterisation of his role drew a sharp response from Lawrence.
  “This protest was inevitable. The only way to protect public safety was to
  accept that and facilitate it,” the Labor upper house member said. “The idea
  of suppressing a mass protest in the name of public safety is just risible.”
  Lawrence said the protest organisers had offered to delay it until 24 August,
  but this had been rejected by a political-level refusal to accept the offer,
  which forced the NSW police into last-minute organisation to manage the huge
  crowd. Minns on Monday foreshadowed that the government may still appeal
  against the ruling by justice Belinda Rigg on Saturday morning, allowing the
  protest to proceed. He did not rule out legislation to restrict future
  protests on the bridge, although he said he would not rush any legislation.
  “No one should believe that it’s open season on the bridge,” he said. Minns
  pointed out that in the past two years, the police had facilitated a hundred
  protests with the Palestine Action Group, as well as scores of other
  demonstrations. The Greens MLC Sue Higginson said Minns was facing strong
  internal dissent over his stance and should start listening. “Labor premier
  Chris Minns is acting strangely and is not listening. He has lost authority
  over his own caucus and on matters too significant to ignore,” she said.
  “There are no current plans to march across the Harbour Bridge again, the
  moment has happened, it was yesterday, and the question now really has to be:
  where was the premier? What was more important for the premier, that he could
  not attend the march for humanity? There may be good reasons he did not
  attend, but the people do deserve to know. “The premier also needs to
  understand that he has absolutely no legal power to block protests, as the
  courts have confirmed, and nor should he.”
