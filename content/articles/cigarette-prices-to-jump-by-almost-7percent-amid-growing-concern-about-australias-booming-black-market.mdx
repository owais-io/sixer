  Cigarette prices to jump by almost 7% amid growing concern about Australia’s
  booming black market

  A scheduled rise in the tobacco excise means cigarette prices in Australia,
  already the highest in the developed world, will jump by nearly 7% on Monday.
  The increase comes amid growing criticisms of the price-led anti-smoking
  policy, which has triggered an explosion in black market tobacco sales and an
  associated jump in violent crime. With the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)
  estimating that one-fifth of tobacco sales are now illegal, some experts warn
  Australia has adopted a “prohibition-style” approach to tobacco control that
  is doomed to fail, and that the excise should be slashed to erode the
  incentives for illegal trade. Excise will rise by 6.8% on 1 September: for a
  pack of 20 cigarettes it will rise from $28.06 to $29.97, or about $1.50 per
  cigarette. The increase is a mix of a standard twice-yearly indexation that
  matches growth in earnings, alongside the third of three special annual 5%
  rises. Becky Freeman, a health professor at the University of Sydney and a
  leading expert of smoking control, said while there could be a case for
  freezing the excise, the focus should be on cracking down on illegal sales.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email She pointed towards New South Wales and
  Victoria introducing tough new laws to combat the widespread sale of illegal
  smokes and vapes, but said more needed to be done and quickly to address what
  she called a “public health emergency”. The South Australian government has
  created a special tobacco enforcement squad with powers to search premises
  without a warrant, seize illegal tobacco or vapes and shut the store for three
  months. The Australian Border Force recently boasted it had intercepted a
  near-record haul of 2,091 tonnes of illicit tobacco products in the year to 30
  June – more than three times the volume in 2019-20 and before the black market
  took off. The ABF also seized 6m illicit vapes. Economists and tax experts
  have pointed to the collapse in revenue from the excise as evidence that the
  price-led strategy is not achieving its goals. A near doubling in the smoking
  tax rate over the five years has coincided with a halving in revenue from the
  tax, from $14.3bn in 2020-21 to an expected $7.1bn this financial year. Chris
  Richardson, an independent economist, was critical of the decision to continue
  lifting the excise rate. “Making a bad policy worse sounds very much like the
  definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting
  a different result,” Richardson said. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has joined
  Victoria’s minister for casino, gaming and liquor regulation in blaming high
  tobacco prices for a spike in violent crime related to the illicit trade.
  Minns has previously called for a cut in the excise rate – a step that has
  been dismissed by Jim Chalmers. A spokesperson for the treasurer said “we want
  to see tobacco excise revenue fall because more people are giving up smoking,
  not because of illegal trade”. “That’s why we’ve invested hundreds of millions
  of dollars in our last two budgets on enforcement and compliance measures to
  crack down on illicit tobacco.”
