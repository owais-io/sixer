  Sixteen states are suing the Trump administration to defend transgender youth
  healthcare access, which has rapidly eroded across the US due to threats from
  the federal government. The Democratic attorneys general of California, New
  York, Massachusetts, Illinois and Connecticut are leading the lawsuit,
  announced on Friday, which challenges the president’s efforts to eradicate
  vital medical treatments for trans youth. The complaint targets one of the
  president’s first executive orders issued in January, which described puberty
  blockers and hormone therapy as “chemical and surgical mutilation”, called for
  federal funds to be withheld from hospitals that provide the treatments and
  suggested the US Department of Justice could investigate doctors. Those
  gender-affirming treatments, which are accessed by a small fraction of youth
  in the US, have for years been the standard of care endorsed by major US
  medical associations. Under intensifying threats that hospitals could lose
  federal funding, and growing fears that providers could be criminally
  prosecuted, a number of major institutions have abruptly ended
  gender-affirming care for trans youth. The crackdown has sent families
  scrambling for alternatives, including in blue states long considered
  sanctuaries for LGBTQ+ rights, where clinics and lawmakers had previously
  assured youth they would be shielded from Donald Trump’s agenda. Last month,
  Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, one of the nation’s largest and most
  prominent institutions to serve trans kids, shuttered its gender-affirming
  care center for youth after three decades, citing funding threats from across
  the federal government. Other institutions that have recently pulled back
  gender-affirming care services for trans youth include Phoenix Children’s
  hospital in Arizona, Stanford Medicine, Denver Health, the University of
  Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania and Children’s National hospital in
  Washington DC. Some have ceased surgeries for patients under age 19, which are
  rare, while others have also ended hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The
  justice department in July also announced that it had sent subpoenas to more
  than 20 doctors and clinics that provide gender-affirming care to youth, a
  move that sent shock waves among providers and raised alarms that patients’
  information could be shared with the federal government. The suit notes the
  administration has already launched criminal investigations and explicitly
  threatened providers in California, Colorado and Massachusetts and that
  officials have “demanded extensive data, including patient medical records”.
  The blue states are also challenging a June memo from Brett Shumate, assistant
  US attorney general, which directed the justice department’s civil division to
  “use all available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors,
  hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and other appropriate entities” that
  provide gender-affirming care. Republican lawmakers in more than 25 states
  have moved to restrict trans youth healthcare in recent years. But the
  treatments remain legal in other parts of the country, and states such as
  California have anti-discrimination laws that explicitly protect the services.
  The plaintiffs argue that Trump’s actions should be declared unlawful,
  alleging his order exceeds federal authority. California’s attorney general,
  Rob Bonta, also challenged Trump’s definition of children as people under the
  age of 19, affecting 18-year-old adults’ access to care, saying the
  administration’s directives force hospitals to violate state laws. Bonta said
  denying this care had been shown to worsen mental health outcomes, including
  increased rates of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. “Trump and Bondi
  are not trained medical professionals. They aren’t at all qualified to give
  anyone medical advice. What’s worse, they refuse to listen to the actual
  experts,” he said at a press conference. Citing comments from one parent of a
  trans child treated at a center that is shutting down, Bonta said: “This
  closure will be life and death for trans youth who can no longer get the care
  they need.” “What would you do if your child was diagnosed with gender
  dysphoria? I would fight for my kid every single day,” added William Tong, the
  Connecticut attorney general. “We’re fighting for … parents who just want to
  do the best for their kids, as we all do, to help them live their best and
  truest lives.” Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Delaware,
  Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode
  Island and Wisconsin, along with the District of Columbia and the Pennsylvania
  governor. “On day one, President Trump took decisive action to stop the
  despicable mutilation and chemical castration of children – which everyday
  Americans resoundingly support,” said Taylor Rogers, a White House
  spokesperson, in an email. “The president has the lawful authority to protect
  America’s vulnerable children through executive action, and the administration
  looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue.” A justice department
  spokesperson added in an email: “As Attorney General Bondi has made clear,
  this Department of Justice will use every legal and law enforcement tool
  available to protect innocent children from being mutilated under the guise of
  ‘care.’” The suit comes after the US supreme court upheld Tennessee’s ban on
  trans youth healthcare. “Hormone therapy truly saves lives,” said Eli, a trans
  16-year-old who lost his healthcare in Los Angeles, in a recent Guardian
  interview. “I wish people understood they’re doing so much more harm than they
  could possibly imagine – that so many lives will be hurt and lost and so many
  people torn apart.”
