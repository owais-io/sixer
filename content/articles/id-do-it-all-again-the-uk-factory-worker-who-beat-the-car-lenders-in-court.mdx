  Marcus Johnson never expected he would be rushing to a car park during a
  family holiday in Somerset to discuss a ruling by the highest court in the UK.
  But the 35-year-old factory worker from Cwmbran in south Wales also had little
  idea that a loan he took out in 2017 to buy a second-hand Suzuki Swift would
  place him at the heart of a David v Goliath battle. His case would go on to
  expose egregious commission practices in the car finance market and lead to a
  compensation scheme that could cost some of the UK’s largest banks and
  specialist lenders up to £18bn. “I thought it would be like when you did those
  PPI claim forms: you were just going to get a few pounds in the bank in a
  month or two. That’s what I expected this to be,” Johnson said. “I had no idea
  it would turn into what it has today. I had no idea the impact it would have.”
  What started as interest in a Facebook advert about potential misselling of
  car loans led to a three-and-a-half year legal battle escalating to the UK
  supreme court. On Friday, Johnson’s case was the sole one of three consumer
  complaints left standing, with supreme court judges concerned about his
  “unfair” treatment by car lenders. That was due in part to the size of the
  commission that the lender paid to the car dealer – a quarter of the Suzuki’s
  near-£6,500 price tag – as well as a failure to disclose that a single lender,
  in this case South Africa’s FirstRand, was given first dibs on the contract,
  rather than it being taken to a panel of lenders to secure the best deal.
  Johnson admitted that he did not read all the documents that the Cardiff
  dealership gave him about the blue hatchback. But the supreme court questioned
  whether it was reasonable to expect “commercially unsophisticated” borrowers
  to read and understand the terms of the commission buried in reams of fine
  print. “It was a very rushed process where they gave me a big box full of
  paperwork and expected me then to comb through hundreds of pages,” Johnson
  recalls. “I felt like they were telling me what I needed to know. I had no
  idea that they were leaving things out.” Once lawyers explained the terms of
  his loan, Johnson was floored. “As all the evidence and all the information
  was presented, I almost found it unbelievable.” His case, which has dragged
  through Britain’s legal system since November 2022, exposed the complex and
  symbiotic relationship between lenders, manufacturers and car dealers in the
  UK’s multi-billion pound motor finance industry. Between 80% and 90% of new
  cars in the UK are now bought using borrowed money, with lenders paying
  commission to dealers. Had the two other cases bundled with Johnson’s claim
  been upheld, the industry could have faced a massive compensation bill fit to
  rival the £50bn PPI scandal. Johnson, speaking during a trip to Butlin’s in
  Minehead with his six-year-old daughter, said the entire saga had been
  stressful at times and pushed him out of his comfort zone. He even gets
  recognised on the street, thanks to doing TV interviews. “I’m not shy, but I
  kind of keep myself to myself, so it’s just a bit strange for me.” However, he
  feels it is a small price to pay to hold lenders to account. He said one car
  finance company contacted him in recent months to ask how it could be more
  transparent with buyers. Johnson is hoping those changes last, and that the
  regulator’s new compensation scheme will give money back to consumers who were
  unknowingly overcharged. “Hopefully it opens up a way for people in my
  position to be able to get what they should back. I would definitely do it all
  again.” Even Andrew Wrench, 61, who lost his case in the same court ruling on
  Friday, said it was worth the battle. Judges rejected Wrench’s case, alongside
  another filed by Amy Hopcraft, a nurse, which argued that commissions paid to
  car dealers amounted to bribes, and that dealers should be acting in
  customers’ best financial interests. While it proved a disappointing end to
  his 26-month court battle, Wrench said family and friends were proud of his
  work. “My nephew Billy said ‘Look, you’ve highlighted it. You’ve done the
  right thing. A lot of people respect you for that, and be proud of what you’ve
  achieved, because there are going to be some compensatory packages for
  consumers.’” While Wrench will not get a payout on that single claim, he
  acknowledged that there could have been sweeping repercussions had his case
  been upheld. Car lenders have warned that a big compensation bill could push
  some firms into failure, while others would offer fewer, or more expensive
  loans, to claw back their losses. That could restrict options for people who
  relied on credit. Spooked by the warning, Rachel Reeves subsequently launched
  a failed attempt to intervene in the supreme court ruling, and warned judges
  to avoid handing a “windfall” to consumers. The chancellor later considered
  overruling the supreme court with retrospective legislation, in order to limit
  a potential £44bn bill. “I didn’t want anybody to lose jobs. I don’t want the
  economy to be affected. And the Treasury is already in a mess anyway,” Wrench
  said. “I wasn’t in it for that, and I wasn’t in it for compensation at all. I
  was in, from the get-go, [to expose lenders] that were deceitful, dishonest
  and otherwise.” But Wrench’s work is not over. He has one more car finance
  claim to pursue, and has two other unrelated cases – on mortgage terms and
  diesel emissions claims – making their way through the courts. In the
  meantime, he is keeping inspirational figures, such as the underdog lawyer and
  environmental campaigner Erin Brockovich, in mind. “She risked everything to
  take on the big boys.” • This article was amended on 5 August 2025. An earlier
  version said that car dealers paid commission to lenders when it should have
  said that lenders paid commission to dealers.
