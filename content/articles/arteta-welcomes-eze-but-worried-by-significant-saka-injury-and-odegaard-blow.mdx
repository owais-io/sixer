  Mikel Arteta said Eberechi Eze had called him on Wednesday as he considered
  whether to sign for Tottenham to check if there might still be a route to
  Arsenal for him. “Yes, that shows you how much he wanted to come,” Arteta
  said, as he reflected on the final twist to a saga that saw Arsenal act on
  their longstanding interest in Eze to gazump Spurs. “It’s very difficult
  sometimes because you want to be very transparent and open with the players.
  They have to make decisions that are very important.” Spurs had agreed a fee
  with Crystal Palace for Eze but Arsenal stole in to get him for £60m plus
  £7.5m in add-ons. They had held the upper hand over Spurs all summer in that
  Eze always preferred to go to them, having supported them as a kid and played
  for their academy between the ages of eight and 13. But Arteta suggested it
  was dramatic and “one of the fastest” transfers in the end. Eze was presented
  to the Emirates Stadium crowd before Saturday’s 5-0 win over Leeds, which
  featured an assured debut from the 15-year-old midfielder Max Dowman, who came
  on as a 64th-minute substitute, but was marred by injuries to Martin Ødegaard
  (shoulder) and Bukayo Saka (hamstring). “I think he [Eze] has the capacity to
  create these magic moments,” Arteta said. “He’s got that flair, that charisma
  that is very contagious. We know he can play as an attacking midfielder, right
  or left. He doesn’t care. He plays shifted off the left, as well. I’m sure we
  will find the right place for him.” Saka’s injury appeared to be more serious
  than that of the captain and the timing is bad, with Arsenal going to
  Liverpool next Sunday. “For Bukayo to come off, for sure it looks like
  something that is significant,” Arteta said. “He felt something in his
  hamstring while he was sprinting. That’s never a good sign. “It’s not the same
  [hamstring] as the previous injury [Saka missed three months of last season
  with a hamstring injury]. But he’s had these injuries before. He knows exactly
  the feeling of that. So let’s wait. Martin felt something in his shoulder when
  he landed. We’ll have to scan him tomorrow and understand a bit better.”
  Arteta watched Dowman win the penalty for the fifth goal, which was converted
  by Viktor Gyökeres, who had earlier made it 3-0 – his first goals for Arsenal.
  The defender Jurriën Timber also scored twice. Saka got the other one. “Max
  has zero hesitation,” Arteta said. “He’s so convinced that he can go at 15 and
  deliver that, which I’ve never witnessed in my life. For us, it brings joy, it
  brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.”
