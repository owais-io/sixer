  The Green party risks going into reverse if they elect Zack Polanski as
  leader, his two opponents have said, arguing that his promised brand of
  “eco-populism” would prove polarising, divisive and likely to put off more
  moderate voters. Speaking to the Guardian before the opening of the month-long
  leadership vote, which begins on Friday, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns said
  the party in England and Wales was at “a crossroads”, and could miss the
  chance to hold the balance of power at the next election. “I strongly believe
  that most British people have had enough with populist approaches to politics
  that seek to simplify everything, that are all about chasing the next
  headline, the next set of likes, rather than real substance,” said Ramsay, who
  has co-led the party with Carla Denyer since 2021. “There’s no point in just
  speaking to a certain section of the public that already backs you. You have
  to communicate in a way that has a broad appeal.” Ramsay, one of four Green
  MPs elected last year, is standing this time with another of their number,
  Chowns, after Denyer opted to stand down. The other hopeful is Polanski, the
  current deputy leader, who has promised to shake up a party operation he
  characterises as over-timid and uninspiring. Polanksi, a fluent communicator
  whose main leadership video has racked up more than 2m views on X, aims to
  make the Greens a mass-membership “eco-populism” movement. This would involve
  a push for more councillors and MPs matched with a radical change in
  communications strategy, seeking to create headlines as effectively as Nigel
  Farage and Reform. Allies of Polanski argue that, given how much effort was
  needed to move from the previous total of one MP to four, expanding in number
  to a meaningful 20 or more MPs would be almost impossible without a much
  bolder approach to generating media coverage. Ramsay and Chowns, however, say
  this would risk undermining the party’s expansion, pointing to their own
  seats, in East Anglia and Herefordshire, which were secured against mainly
  Conservative opposition. “Anyone who wants to win in a first-past-the-post
  system has to be able to win the trust of people who don’t agree with them
  about absolutely everything, ideologically or policy-wise, but feel that they
  can put their trust in that person,” said Chowns. “That’s the reality of the
  system that we work within. “This gets to the core of the difference between
  the leadership that Adrian and I are offering in contrast to the leadership
  that that Zack seems to be offering. We’re way past those kinds of old ideas
  of politics being binary, left and right, simplistic like that.” Polanski, she
  argued, would risk limiting Green support to a committed core of little more
  than 10% of people, and would alienate less radical but more numerous
  left-leaning voters who could be drawn to the party. “The danger of having a
  particularly polarising, strident approach to politics is that you seem very
  attractive to the people who already like you, but you may put off that wider
  range of people you’ve got to be able to attract,” she said. The vote of party
  members runs throughout August, with the winner or winners announced on 2
  September. Green insiders say they have no idea which way the contest could
  go. Ramsay said the differences in approach, plus fragmented political
  loyalties that could result in Labour relying on Green support after the next
  election, made the contest perhaps the most significant in the party’s
  history. A Polanski win, he argued, might instead make the Greens slide back
  into irrelevance. “We can’t assume we will continue to go forward,” he said.
  “We have dragged the Green party out of the wilderness years that we were in,
  in my early time in the party, when people said: ‘We like what you stand for,
  but are you credible? Are you actually going to be able to make any
  difference?’ “We have shown we can win seats at the general election because
  we’ve got a message that’s both bold and credible, and we have got to be both.
  And if you look at the sorts of tactics that Zack is proposing, they’re quite
  similar to what happened in Australia, where [in the 2025 federal election]
  the Greens went back from four seats to one. So we can’t assume that that
  progress will continue.” A particular difference could be in how the Greens
  approach possible links with a new leftwing party co-led by Jeremy Corbyn and
  Zarah Sultana. While Polanski has said he could be open to cooperation, Ramsay
  and Chowns are more sceptical. “Cooperation is in the DNA of the Greens,”
  Chowns said. “We have always said we will cooperate with people wherever there
  is common ground.” However, she argued, the launch of the new party – which
  has been accompanied by disagreements between its two leaders and is still
  name-less – “has not been the smoothest”. She added: “If I was a voter looking
  for an alternative to the current way of doing politics, or a frustrated
  Labour voter, I’m not sure that that would inspire confidence.”
