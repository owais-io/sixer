  Warning: This article contains historical records that use racist and
  offensive language, and descriptions of events that will be distressing to
  some readers The Naaguja Yamatji elder Derek Councillor has heard accounts of
  Major Logue passed down for generations. He would ride up on his horse
  shooting Aboriginal people on sight. “He wouldn’t ask questions – he’d just
  shoot and kill,” Councillor tells Guardian Australia. “When people used to see
  him riding up to wherever they were, a lot of people were scared and would run
  away, they wouldn’t [want] to be where he was.” The stories of a feared man
  once whispered about in communities around Geraldton, 400km north of Perth,
  have been confirmed by the man’s own hand, 123 years after his death. Logue –
  Major is his given name, not a military rank – went on to become one of
  Western Australia’s earliest parliamentarians. He kept a diary from 1850 to
  his death in 1900, a version of which is being prepared for publication. But
  those behind the forthcoming book have decided to omit information relating to
  the killings. Councillor and other traditional owners are demanding that the
  diary be published in full. Amid handwritten diary entries that document 50
  years of daily life are chilling accounts of the killing of local Yamatji
  people. Writing in a code called pigpen, also known as Freemason’s cipher,
  Logue described the murders of at least 19 Yamatji people between 1851 and
  1853. The coded entries, deciphered by Guardian Australia as part of the
  Descendants series, record a number of attacks on Yamatji by Logue and others
  – some where he was directly responsible, others recording attacks made by his
  neighbours. Some of the dead, who appear in earlier pages of the diary as
  helping the settlers, are listed by name. A version of his diaries is being
  prepared for publication by a small press publisher in WA which focuses on
  colonial diaries and historical texts and includes books about Aboriginal
  Australians. The publisher’s latest booklist, published in July 2025, includes
  descriptions of historical works using outdated and racist terms, including
  one use of “nigger”, titles that repeatedly refer to Aboriginal people as
  “savages” and in one title “clapped out gins”. A local historian, Nan Broad,
  who has worked on the diaries for six years and prepared them for publication,
  tells Guardian Australia she had translated the coded sections and knows they
  describe the murders of Aboriginal people. “It’s a bit hard to single that
  poor fellow out just because he wrote a diary – that’s a bit underhanded,” she
  says. “To protect the person who holds the diaries we felt it was … expedient,
  perhaps, to not have that in writing. Everyone knows they did it.” Broad says
  Logue’s actions on the frontier were well known locally but the nation is not
  yet ready to understand its often bloody and brutal past. “I am very
  distressed by that situation,” she says. “But we are too close to it at the
  moment. “In Australia we are too close to the colonisation, confrontation and
  the history that went on. It’s not old history yet to be looked at
  dispassionately.” Frontier killings and massacres were widespread from the
  arrival of the first white settlers to Australia in 1788. An eight-year
  project by the University of Newcastle documented hundreds of massacres and
  frontier killings. That project, published in conjunction with Guardian
  Australia, found that 10,657 people were killed in at least 438 colonial
  frontier massacres. Councillor says the full extent of the Logue diaries,
  including the coded sections of past deeds, must be published to heal and
  acknowledge the truth. “They should be published in full,” he says. “We
  Yamatji people, we don’t half-tell a story. We tell the story fully. If he did
  do all these killings and it’s in his diaries, it should be published that he
  did do it.” There are 11 coded diary entries between 1851 and 1853 that
  describe shooting and killing Aboriginal people; witnessing others doing the
  shooting; going on a “campaign” to kill natives; and later riding over the
  “battlefield” and seeing the bodies of those he killed lying dead or “hastily
  buried”. The diaries do not contain mention of the 1854 Bootenal massacre, in
  which 30 Naaguja men, women and children were recorded as killed by a group of
  settlers led by the local police deputy superintendent, John Nicol Drummond,
  Logue’s brother-in-law. The Naaguja say the actual number killed was in the
  hundreds. Scans of the diaries have been available on microfilm at the Battye
  library in Perth since the 1950s. But publisher Hesperian Press and a
  descendant of Logue who holds the original diaries have declined to publish
  the coded sections in the version being prepared for sale. Broad says she
  supports their decision. Hesperian Press’s owner, Peter Bridge, did not
  respond to questions about Yamatji concerns, but in an earlier statement to
  Guardian Australia said the coded sections of Logue’s diaries were “in unique
  characters” and “are not omitted – they are simply unprintable”. He added that
  the location of the omitted passages would be indicated in the published book;
  that the printed edition of the Logue diaries would make “no attempt to
  deceive, suppress or editorialise” and that Hesperian Press was publishing a
  primary document “faithfully and unflinchingly, as is our usual method”. “If
  your concern is that the code may conceal politically potent material – I
  suggest that you take that up with Logue himself, who is, unfortunately,
  unavailable for an interview,” he said. “We publish the diaries because they
  are historical documents, not a moral confession.” Councillor says the diary
  “just confirms what we as Yamatji people have said”. “We weren’t lying when we
  told these stories,” he said “This actually proves it. “The stories of those
  people that were involved in those massacres and the people that died, they
  can rest easy now because their story’s been told. “They’ll be able to finally
  settle, instead of being tormented and their soul not resting. They will
  finally rest in peace.” • Indigenous Australians can call 13YARN on 13 92 76

  place in 1854, not 1954 as an earlier version said.
