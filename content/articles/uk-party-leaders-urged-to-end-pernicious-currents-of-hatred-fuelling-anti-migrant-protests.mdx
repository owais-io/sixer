  More than 200 refugee organisations, charities and trade unions have signed an
  open letter calling on Britain’s political leaders to end “pernicious and
  insidious currents” of racism and hatred that underpin a slew of anti-migrant
  protests. The letter, coordinated by the campaign coalition Together With
  Refugees, has been signed by organisations including Amnesty International UK,
  City of Sanctuary UK, Care for Calais, Doctors of the World, the End Violence
  Against Women Coalition, Freedom from Torture, Islamic Relief, Oxfam, the
  Public and Commercial Services Union, Refugee Action and Safe Passage. It was
  drafted in response to weeks of protests outside asylum seeker hotels in
  locations across the country, often countered by anti-racism activists. The
  protests have come against a backdrop of inflammatory language or
  misinformation from senior politicians including the Reform UK leader, Nigel
  Farage, and the senior Conservative Robert Jenrick. In June, the prime
  minister, Keir Starmer, said he regretted a speech warning that Britain could
  become an “island of strangers”. This weekend, Jenrick prompted anger by
  claiming mass migration was putting at risk women and girls. He repeated the
  claim that 40% of sexual assaults committed in London last year were carried
  out by foreign nationals – one of several assertions about immigration that
  have been disputed or debunked in recent days. On Monday, Reform UK claimed
  migrants from Muslim countries posed a threat to women’s safety in Britain, as
  the party’s only female MP, Sarah Pochin, claimed asylum seekers arriving on
  small boats held “medieval views”. The charities’ open letter, sent to the
  main UK party leaders on Monday, says: “Anti-refugee protests across the
  country have been distressing to witness, with echoes of last summer’s riots
  making them all the more alarming. “The pernicious and insidious currents of
  racism and hatred underlying these protests are glaring evidence of a failing
  system. The responsibility to end the divisive politics, racist rhetoric and
  demonising language of the past is yours. Only then will you bring unity
  instead of division and cohesion rather than hate.” The letter concludes: “For
  those who need our compassion to be confronted with further torment here in
  the UK is shocking. But the outpouring of support from communities condemning
  the hatred is a powerful reminder that these views do not represent the vast
  majority. Today we stand in solidarity with those targeted, because this is
  what represents our country, this is who we are.” Sonya Sceats, the chief
  executive at Freedom from Torture, said: “No matter who we are or where we
  come from, we all have the right to feel safe. We know from our clinical work
  that many men, women and children in these hotels came here seeking protection
  after being tortured in countries like Afghanistan and Iran. “To meet with
  hate on the streets of Britain, whipped up by politicians for their own ends,
  makes survivors feel hunted again and adds to their trauma. This isn’t who we
  are as a country. “It is down to the millions of us who want a more
  compassionate approach to stand together with refugees and for an end to the
  torture and repression which drives people across borders in the first place.”
  Jo Benefield, the volunteer campaign coordinator for Bristol Defend the Asylum
  Seekers Campaign, was one of many signatories who took part in
  counter-gatherings across the country. In Bristol on Saturday, estimates
  suggest the protesters were outnumbered by eight to one, with about 50 in the
  anti-refugee group compared with about 400 people standing in solidarity with
  refugees. She said: “In the riots of last summer it was counter-protesters who
  protected residents in another Bristol hotel before police arrived. So the
  people staying in the hotel being targeted this year were pleased to know so
  many of the local community were there to support them.” Tim Naor Hilton, the
  chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “The vicious and relentless attacks
  on people seeking asylum from some politicians and sections of the media using
  age-old racist tropes and shoddy data must stop now. We must build on the huge
  swathes of support for refugees that has spilled out onto the streets and
  create truly resilient and welcoming communities.” Together With Refugees, the
  largest pro-refugee coalition in UK history, with more than 600 member
  organisations, is calling for a plan that upholds the UK’s commitment under
  international law to the right to claim asylum, provides a proper strategy for
  welcoming refugees, and forges stronger global cooperation to tackle the root
  causes that force people to flee their homes.
