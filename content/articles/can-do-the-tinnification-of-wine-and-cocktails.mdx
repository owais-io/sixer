  I’ve been asked about the “tinnification” of drinks pretty much everywhere
  else, so it feels only apt to talk about it here, too, because producers are
  putting just about everything they can in a can these days. Obviously, canned
  drinks aren’t anything new – the first canned beer went on sale in 1935, when
  post-prohibition America saw Krueger’s Finest Beer punted to drinkers in
  Virginia. Similar attempts had been made many years earlier, but it wasn’t
  until after two years of testing that the boffins finally developed a special
  coating that prevented the beer from reacting with the tin can. And it’s not
  just beer that’s getting the aluminium treatment. Canned cocktails and canned
  wine are now going from strength to strength, too (and irrespective of whether
  you view the latter as a marvel of modern science or a vinous abomination) .
  Time was when only Provençal rosé and New Zealand sauvignon blanc got the
  tinned treatment, but now everything from orange wine to English sparkling is
  getting tinnified. The reasons for this are many, and all are inescapably tied
  to modern drinking habits. The Silicon Valley Bank’s 2025 state of the US wine
  industry report recorded a rise of 29.3% in the uptake of so-called
  ready-to-drink (RTD) products, citing convenience and cost as two of the main
  factors for that increase. I mean, yeah, we’re all broke right now (although
  you don’t need me to tell you that – you need only look at the emergence of
  the £7 pint). And although we might end up drinking a bottle of tequila over
  the space of a couple of months, a £3 pre-mixed can is far more appealing to
  the wallet than a £30 bottle. It doesn’t just cost less; there’s less liquid,
  too. Well, obviously – but at least that means it’s easier to track how much
  you’ve had, particularly for RTD cocktails. And, for the mental and physical
  health-conscious drinker, it’s much easier to quantify the units in three cans
  of spritz than it is to eyeball a bottle of Campari to work out the same
  metric. There are many new brands that, effectively, have been launched to
  meet this purpose, but there are also plenty of existing brands that have
  pivoted to meet demand. But does tinnification affect the drinking experience,
  and does it affect the liquid itself? New Zealand wine producer Villa Maria,
  known for its supermarket sauvignon, started putting its stuff in cans a
  couple of months ago. They’ve kept dissolved oxygen levels below 0.5 parts per
  million to protect aroma and flavour, and they claim this was noticeable
  during a six-month comparative trial between canned and bottled wines. David
  Roper, the group’s winemaker, also notes the reduced ecological impact of cans
  over bottles, because they’re lighter, infinitely recyclable and have a lower
  carbon footprint than glass, so benefit both the producer and the consumer. It
  seems the age of aluminium is only just beginning: better make room in your
  fridge. Four cans to keep in the fridge Fever-Tree &amp; Papa Salt Blood
  Orange Gin Spritz £3 (250ml) Waitrose, 5%. A Sicilian orange tipple featuring
  my new favourite saline gin. Vinca Organic Rosé £3 (187ml) Tesco, 12.5%. 100%
  syrah from west Sicily made in a pale Provence style. Whitebox Freezer Martini
  £5.80 (100ml) Delli, 34.4%. A punch in the face at that ABV, and an excellent
  freezer standby. El Rayo Tequila Tonic £39 (12 x 250ml, or £3.25 a can) El
  Rayo, 7%. El Rayo’s Plata teamed with Indian tonic water: clean, citrussy,
  crisp.
