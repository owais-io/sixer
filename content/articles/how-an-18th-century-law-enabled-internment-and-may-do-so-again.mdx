  Naoko Fujii’s great-grandfather Jotaro Mori was out fishing when Japan bombed
  Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. When Mori returned home hours later, the FBI
  was waiting at his door, ready to arrest him under a wartime law that declared
  citizens of foreign adversaries “alien enemies”. He was detained without due
  process and spent the next four years in concentration camps across the
  western US, including the infamous camp Lordsburg in New Mexico where two
  elderly Japanese internees were killed. The government seized his home and
  laundry business so that when he was released, he was left with nothing.
  “There was no warrant, no charges, no evidence he ever did anything,” said
  Fujii, who added that, at the time of his arrest, her great-grandfather had
  been living in America for more than four decades. “He was picked up just
  because he’s Japanese.” In March, Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act
  of 1798 for just the fourth time in US history, deporting scores of Venezuelan
  migrants, without due process, to a mega-prison in El Salvador. Civil rights
  groups challenged the administration’s authority to use the law, which is now
  being heard by the conservative 5th circuit court of appeals. As the case
  looks likely to soon reach the supreme court, advocates and legal experts
  pointed to the dangerous precedent established by the last time the law was
  invoked, which led to the mass incarceration of both immigrants and US
  citizens of Japanese descent. “The Alien Enemies Act normalized the idea of
  internment and targeting people not based on their conduct but on their
  ancestry,” said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for
  Justice and leading expert on the history of the 18th-century law. The law
  stipulates that, when war is declared, “all natives, citizens, denizens, or
  subjects of the hostile nation” over the age of 14 can be apprehended or
  removed. This means anyone who was born or holds citizenship in a country
  considered a “foreign adversary” is vulnerable, Yon Ebright said, whether or
  not they actually pose a national security threat. “By the structure of the
  law,” Yon Ebright said, “you can be targeted based on who you are and where
  you’re born, not what you’ve done.” The Alien Enemies Act was one of four laws
  passed as part of the sweeping Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798; the three
  others have since expired or been repealed. The law was invoked just three
  times in US history, all in times of war. On 7 December 1941, in the immediate
  aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin D Roosevelt invoked
  the Alien Enemies Act to round up more than 31,000 Japanese, German and
  Italian nationals. Two months later, the law paved the way for executive order
  9066, which directed 120,000 Japanese on the west coast – two-thirds of whom
  were US citizens – to internment camps across the country. In the 1940s,
  Japanese immigrants faced an impossible situation, said Aarti Kohli, executive
  director at the legal services group Asian Law Caucus. Discriminatory federal
  laws barred them from becoming naturalized citizens, which made them targets
  under the Alien Enemies Act. “It’s a catch-22,” Kohli said. “They were
  targeted because they weren’t citizens, but they also couldn’t become
  citizens.” The Trump administration invoked the law to deport more than 200
  Venezuelan migrants it accused of being members of the transnational criminal
  gang Tren de Aragua. Similar to Japanese internees, experts say, Venezuelan
  deportees were not given a chance to disprove the government’s accusations. In
  a 14 March memorandum, the Department of Justice claimed that the Alien
  Enemies Act allows federal law enforcement officers to conduct warrantless
  house raids and deportations without court hearings. Government deception is
  one throughline connecting the current and most recent invocations of the
  Alien Enemies Act, Kohli said. In 1983, the organization was part of a
  multi-team effort to clear the conviction records of three Japanese Americans
  held in wartime concentration camps. Their legal cases uncovered proof that
  the justice department suppressed, altered and destroyed intelligence reports
  that acknowledged Japanese Americans did not pose a military threat to the US.
  Similarly, Kohli said, multiple intelligence agencies have contradicted
  Trump’s claim that the Venezuelan government is controlling Tren de Agua –
  which formed his rationale for invoking the Alien Enemies Act. Descendants of
  those who suffered under the law are fighting to ensure that history does not
  repeat itself. In January, dozens of groups representing former internees and
  their families endorsed a measure to repeal the statute, introduced by Senator
  Mazie Hirono and Representative Ilhan Omar. The legacy of the Alien Enemies
  Act is not confined to the US. More than 2,000 Japanese immigrants in Latin
  America were deported to the US for internment as part of an obscure hostage
  exchange program. The Latin Japanese internees were treated both as “alien
  enemies” and unlawful entrants whom the US tried to deport to warn-torn Japan,
  Yon Ebright said, a country that many had little memory of. Grace Shimizu’s
  father immigrated from Japan to Peru in the 1920s, when he was 18. He and his
  brothers operated a successful charcoal business in Lima that was blacklisted
  by authorities. When war broke out, the government seized the company and
  shipped the brothers to a US concentration camp. None of them ever returned to
  Peru, Shimizu said. After the war, her uncle and his family were deported to
  Japan. Her father fought his deportation order and, with the sponsorship of
  Japanese American relatives in California, lived out the rest of his life in
  the San Francisco Bay Area. “This kind of government abuse is not new,” said
  Shimizu, director of the Campaign for Justice: Redress Now for Japanese Latin
  Americans. But today, “there are many more individuals and communities
  targeted as ‘the enemy’, technological advances to enhance overreach and
  capacity, and twisted government policies, actions and justifications.”
