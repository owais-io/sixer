  James Trickey: Don’t Count on Me review – accountant takes calculated risk in
  fringe debut 
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  There’s a bait-and-switch to begin newcomer James Trickey’s show, which starts
  with our host in sunglasses raving to techno music. The music stops, the
  shades are removed and then, in deadpan: “I’m a chartered accountant.” It’s a
  fun pivot, from suave to schmuck. It’s also a misdirection, because Trickey
  then re-ascends to high status for the rest of the show, delivering his debut
  set in unusually imperious style at a time when, for fringe wannabes at least,
  self-deprecation is the norm. You’ve got to admire the chutzpah; high status
  is harder for a rookie to pull off. It comes at the expense of warmth, though:
  I found Trickey’s maiden fringe set reminiscent of Jack Whitehall’s way back
  when. He’s technically excellent, plenty of good jokes, sometimes a bit
  facile, his mannerisms occasionally feeling borrowed. His is an expertly
  constructed example of the genus “debut fringe show”, deploying his day job
  and field of expertise (accountancy and mathematics) as a lens through which
  to explore who he is, where he’s come from – and where he’s going. That’s a
  lot to get through, and Trickey packs plenty into the hour, ranging across his
  parentage – old white dad, Cambodian mum – his passion for tomato puree, and
  the kids’ trust fund he’s establishing based on Subway loyalty points. The
  latter prompts a section on probability and expectation, consisting of a weak
  rap/rhyme set-piece and reflections on the gamble he’s taking by quitting
  accountancy for standup. Earlier, we get some material making hay with our
  host’s dual heritage (“Am I being racially excluded from the racist banter?”).
  One or two of those jokes are funnier in principle than in practice. The
  tenuous idea is apparent behind a routine justifying racism based on the GDP
  of the country being abused, but it raises a wan smile at best. The joke about
  how seedy it looks when ageing white dad takes young Asian son to school is
  not a pleasant one. Technique may be running ahead of judicious selection of
  material, then, but Trickey has certainly got it, and his gamble in taking up
  comedy looks odds-on to pay off. At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 24
