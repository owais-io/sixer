  Female leaders who have reached the top should be admired for getting to where
  they are. And while Gaby Hinsliff makes many excellent points about the
  expectations placed on female leaders (Remember when having women in power was
  supposed to change everything?, 15 August), I believe we shouldn’t stop
  acknowledging their achievements for getting there in the first place –
  especially as we are still so far from gender parity. The fact is, women
  continue to face unnecessary additional challenges throughout their careers,
  whether in business or politics. Although in recent decades we have seen signs
  of progress, with some female leaders elected and more businesses committing
  to achieving gender parity, the actual pace of change has been glacial at
  best. We are already seeing signs of backwards steps as people become
  complacent with gender parity and progress. The Pipeline’s latest Women Count
  report revealed that female representation in FTSE 350 executive roles fell
  for the first time in eight years. And the recent backlash against diversity,
  equity and inclusion will have only set us back further. People such as
  Jacinda Ardern and Angela Merkel shouldn’t be idolised just because they are
  women. They should be idolised for their tenacity in forging a path to a
  position where women are still a small minority. We can support female
  leaders’ achievements and still critique their execution. And just because a
  few women have “made it” doesn’t mean we should stop there – we are still a
  long way from the finish line and can’t afford to rest on our laurels yet.
