  shocks

  The teeth, perhaps, were slightly gritted, but Richard Hannon offered some
  perspective after watching his colt, Rosallion, finish second to the 150-1
  shot Qirat in the Sussex Stakes on Wednesday. “That’s horse racing,” the
  trainer said. “That’s what keeps us all in it. It’s not a great day when
  you’re second in these races but we’re lucky to be part of them.” Mundane
  words like “shock” and “upset” do not come close to describing the result of
  this Group One contest, one of the most prestigious and prized events in the
  global racing calendar, which was won by a horse that finished 27th of 30
  runners in the Royal Hunt Cup Handicap on his previous trip to the track.
  Qirat, as the stewards drily noted afterwards, “appeared to show improved form
  compared with its previous run”. Ralph Beckett’s gelding was widely assumed to
  be in the race simply to ensure an even pace before Field Of Gold, the 1-3
  favourite and, like Qirat, in the colours of the Juddmonte operation, swept
  through the field to victory. It was, as it transpired, a rash assumption. The
  first part of the script played out much as expected, as Serengeti, the
  pacemaker for Aidan O’Brien’s Henri Matisse, worked his way to the front after
  a slow start and then went clear with Qirat and Richard Kingscote in close
  attendance. At the point around two furlongs out, Field Of Gold was expected
  to start closing them down. However, it soon became clear that the favourite
  was struggling to make ground. Instead, it was Sean Levy, on Rosallion, who
  set off in pursuit of the leaders, but as Serengeti dropped away, Qirat stayed
  on well and he was still two lengths in front at the furlong pole. Rosallion
  closed all the way to the winning post but Kingscote – who called the result
  “a bit surreal” – and Qirat still had a neck to spare at the line. Qirat was
  the longest-priced winner of a Group One race in Britain since the grading
  system was introduced in the early 1970s. Field Of Gold was clearly a long way
  below his best on his first visit to this tricky downland track, but Kingscote
  also deserves great credit for a no-nonsense ride at a frontrunners’ track, in
  a race where his rivals left themselves with too much to do. Beckett, Qirat’s
  trainer, was certainly surprised to find himself in the winner’s enclosure
  afterwards, but not entirely astonished. “We set out to go 12-second
  furlongs,” he said. “That was the plan and what he did. It is as simple as
  that. They didn’t sit close to him and that is the end result. When he went
  past Serengeti, I could see they were not coming and I was fairly confident he
  would not stop.” Kingscote described the outcome as “not what I expected this
  morning” but the race was also a fine advertisement for his talent for judging
  the fractions in front, a gift that should find plenty of new fans when
  Kingscote sets off for a four-month stint in Hong Kong from the start of
  September. “Towards the cut-away [around two furlongs out] I was thinking he
  was going well,” Kingscote said, “but you always expect the horses rated 20lb
  higher to be coming through. “It is better to be going off [to Hong Kong] on a
  positive note. I’m looking forward to the opportunity but I have not burned
  bridges so I can always come back if need be.” John Gosden, the trainer of
  Field Of Gold, said that the favourite “didn’t seem too well-balanced on the
  track”, adding: “He got a little unbalanced coming out of the dip into the
  bend, but I am not making any excuses. They ignored the pacemaker and paid the
  price.” Fire can blaze a trail in Nassau The five-runner field for Thursday’s
  Nassau Stakes is the joint-smallest this century for the Group One feature on
  the third day of Glorious Goodwood, but while Minding was a prohibitive 1-5
  favourite to beat four opponents in 2016, this year’s renewal is a fascinating
  and open contest with four closely matched fillies at single-figure odds.
  Whirl, the Oaks runner-up and a Group One winner in Ireland last time out,
  heads the three-year-old challenge alongside Cercene, last month’s Coronation
  Stakes winner, and Bedtime Story, who is looking to recapture the form of her
  impressive juvenile success at Royal Ascot last summer. It is an impressive
  squad for the Classic generation, in a Group One where three-year-olds have
  enjoyed plenty of success in recent seasons. They face a stern four-year-old
  opponent in See The Fire (3.05), however, and Andrew Balding’s filly is a
  solid 2-1 shot to improve on her narrow defeat in this race 12 months ago. See
  The Fire produced one of the most visually impressive performances of the
  season to finish a dozen lengths clear of her field in the Middleton Stakes at
  York in May in a fast time, and raced closer to the pace than the two that
  beat her in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot last month. That run
  in open company confirmed that she is an improved performer this season and
  Ombudsman, the winner, went down only narrowly in the Eclipse next time out.
  Goodwood 1.20 Best Secret was a big-money buy to join the Wathnan Racing
  operation before Royal Ascot last month and repaid at least a little of the
  outlay when finishing third in a strong renewal of the Golden Gates Handicap,
  despite finding plenty of traffic problems in the home straight. If James
  Doyle can keep him out of trouble from stall two, his proven turn of foot
  could well be decisive. Goodwood 1.55 Clive Cox’s Coppull was a big outsider
  for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot but took a major stride forward to
  finish third, just a neck behind the runner-up, Do Or Do Not. The latter colt
  franked the form when finishing second to Zavateri, Tuesday’s Vintage Stakes
  winner, next time up and Coppull has scope for significant further progress on
  just his third trip to the track. Goodwood 2.30 This is a much-anticipated
  step into Group-race company for Merchant, who beat Serious Contender, the
  subsequent runner-up in the Irish Derby, by a length in the King George V
  Handicap at Royal Ascot last month. William Haggas’s colt was among the
  initial entries for last weekend’s Group One King George VI at Ascot and will
  be a warm order for this traditional trial for the St Leger at Doncaster in
  September. Goodwood 3.45 Ascot’s stiff final furlong was the undoing of Ruby’s
  Profit at the Royal meeting last month but this return to a sharp five
  furlongs should see her in a much better light. The speedy frontrunner was a
  course-and-distance winner in May off a 5lb lower mark and she remains
  well-handicapped on that form.
