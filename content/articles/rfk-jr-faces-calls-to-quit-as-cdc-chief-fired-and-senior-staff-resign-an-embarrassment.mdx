  embarrassment’

  It’s been a tumultuous week for US health agencies, with the departure of
  several top officials, uncertainty around new Covid vaccine restrictions, and
  even more experts calling for the removal of top health official Robert F
  Kennedy Jr. The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC), Susan Monarez, was fired by the Trump White House after some
  controversy, and four other top officials also resigned. “[The] CDC basically
  imploded yesterday and now it’s truly in shambles,” said Katelyn Jetelina, an
  epidemiologist and former senior adviser for the CDC. “This is a national
  security risk to Americans. Without steady-headed, evidence-informed
  leadership, everything from outbreaks to data to chronic diseases to injury is
  in jeopardy.” Kennedy also released controversial and confusing restrictions
  on Covid vaccines on Wednesday. “I’m worried that these confusing changes will
  cause chaos in the vaccine distribution system that will make it harder for
  people–even those at high risk of severe illness–to get the Covid vaccines
  they may want,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director
  of the Pandemic Center at Brown University school of public health. The chaos
  on Wednesday intensified scrutiny of Kennedy after controversial moves on
  vaccines and the shooting at the CDC reportedly motivated by anti-vaccine
  briefs. Kennedy “has to go”, said Colin Carlson, an assistant professor of
  epidemiology at Yale University’s school of public health, who has joined
  other health professionals to call for his resignation or termination.
  Monarez, who was confirmed as the CDC head only weeks ago on July 31, was
  released from her post on Wednesday evening per a post on X by the US
  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). But lawyers representing
  Monarez, Mark S. Zaid and Abbe Lowell, responded in a statement posted to
  Bluesky that she had neither resigned nor been fired. “She will not resign,”
  Zaid wrote. Monarez had refused to “rubber-stamp reckless, unscientific
  directives,” the statement said. An hour and a half later, the White House
  doubled down and said Monarez had officially been fired. Four other top
  officials at the CDC also resigned on Wednesday including Debra Houry, the
  CDC’s chief medical officer; Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National
  Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases; Daniel Jernigan, the
  director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases;
  and Jennifer Layden, director of the office of public health data,
  surveillance and technology. Daskalakis wrote in his resignation letter that
  he had “never experienced such radical non-transparency, nor have I seen such
  unskilled manipulation of data to achieve a political end”. Daskalakis, a key
  figure in the Covid, mpox, and bird flu responses, added that “no CDC subject
  matter expert from my Center has ever briefed the Secretary” – during the
  worst measles outbreak in the US in decades that left two children and one
  adult dead. Earlier on Wednesday, Kennedy announced on X that updated mRNA
  Covid boosters were being approved for people “at higher risk”. There was no
  press release from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Pfizer
  vaccine is approved for anyone who is 5 years old or older with health
  conditions. The emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s pediatric vaccine was
  rescinded, as the Guardian previously reported might happen – which means it
  is no longer available to children under 5. The Moderna vaccine is approved
  for anyone over the age of 6 months with health conditions. That appears to
  mean there are no Covid vaccines available for children or adults without
  health conditions, as the summer Covid wave intensifies. Yet Kennedy also
  appeared to contradict himself in the post, writing: “These vaccines are
  available for all patients who choose them after consulting with their
  doctors.” Kennedy “very much contradicted himself yesterday, making a
  confusing situation even more confusing”, Jetelina said. FDA head Marty Makary
  said on X that any adult may choose to get the Covid vaccine. The officials
  seem to be referring to a practice known as off-label use, where a physician
  prescribes a medication for a use other than what it was approved for, Nuzzo
  said. “It’s possible for people who are not eligible to get them off label.
  But whether they will practically be able to do that is another question,” she
  said. In some states, pharmacists and other vaccinators are unable to
  administer vaccines to people who are not explicitly eligible. “It’s also
  dubious whether doctors will be willing to vaccinate off label, possibly
  worrying about legal risks. We’re already hearing about pregnant women being
  unable to get Covid vaccines after the secretary tweeted,” Nuzzo said. It’s
  not yet clear which higher-risk conditions may qualify. The CDC has a list for
  previous vaccines, but in May top FDA officials proposed a more stringent list
  of conditions. The proposed list included pregnancy, the recommendation for
  which Kennedy removed in May. There is confusion about whether patients may
  self-attest to a condition or if they need to provide proof – which may make
  it difficult for pharmacists and other vaccinators to interpret and implement
  the new rules. These restrictions may also make it harder for people to access
  the vaccines even when they’re eligible. “This is another way to reduce access
  to vaccines: Mass confusion,” Jetelina said. Usually the CDC’s independent
  advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) meets to issue
  recommendations for the updated shots. Right now, the ACIP website lists the
  August/September meeting as “TBD”. These recommendations affect insurance
  coverage of the vaccines. This week’s moves are only part of the bedlam
  currently within US health agencies. On Tuesday, Kennedy said in a cabinet
  meeting that a fast-paced research project on autism was to identify “certain
  interventions” that are “almost certainly causing autism”. He said these
  results would be announced in September. This project, which included the
  creation of a national research registry of autistic people, has been panned
  by researchers and advocates as an unscientific attempt to link vaccines to
  autism. Last week, the CDC appointed Retsef Levi, a professor of operations
  management at the MIT Sloan school of management, to lead an ACIP task force
  on Covid vaccines. Levi has said mRNA vaccines “cause serious harm including
  death, especially among young people”, adding: “We have to stop giving them
  immediately!” Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, called on
  Wednesday for Kennedy to be fired, writing: “we cannot let RFK Jr. burn what’s
  left of CDC.” Kennedy is “an embarrassment to both sides of the aisle”, said
  Carlson. “Seeing Patty Murray and the American Public Health Association
  (APHA) come to the same conclusion – that RFK has to go – gives me a lot of
  hope. Let’s fight. I think we can win.”
