  The Tropicana Crisis of 2009 underlined the importance of a company’s
  branding. In January of that year, the orange juicemaker, owned by PepsiCo,
  changed the look of its cartons. The shiny orange punctured by a straw was
  replaced by an almost abstract blob of orange juice. Consumers responded
  accordingly, and sales dropped by as much as 20%. Less than two months after
  rolling out its new look, Tropicana announced it would switch back to the
  original packaging. Since then, the slate of companies with messy rebrands has
  only grown. Facebook became Meta. Twitter became X. The UK fund manager
  Standard Life Aberdeen became “abrdn”, before switching to “aberdeen”. All
  attracted ridicule. This week MSNBC entered the chat: the cable news channel
  announced it would change its name to MS Now (My Source News Opinion World)
  after splitting from NBC later this year. Users online are once again taking
  part in the schadenfreude of a haphazard rebrand. “It sounds like the newest
  addition to the Microsoft Office suite,” read one comment on Reddit. “Sounds
  like you’re demanding to be given multiple sclerosis immediately,” offered
  another. In a statement, MSNBC assured viewers its new name “underscores our
  mission: to serve as your destination for breaking news and thoughtful
  analysis” as it splits with NBC News. The channel will now be a part of
  Versant, a spin-off from Comcast, and will join the business news channel
  CNBC, Golf Channel, GolfNow and SportsEngine. CNBC, which initially stood for
  Consumer News and Business Channel, will keep its current name. Marketing
  experts said this was just the latest example of a company navigating the
  difficult terrain of a rebrand. In 2019, when Mastercard announced it was
  simply removing its name from its logo, the company’s chief marketing
  executive told the Wall Street Journal it spent almost two years surveying
  customers around the world to ensure people would still recognize the brand.
  “Consumers would be shocked at the amount of effort that is often behind many
  of these changes,” Americus Reed, a marketing professor at the University of
  Pennsylvania’s Wharton business school, said. “You would not believe how
  willing people are to sit for hours and agonize over the curve of the font,
  should this be teal or not really blue.” Of MSNBC’s new logo, Reed said: “I
  promise you that a lot of time and energy went into coming up with that
  picture… They spent months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to do this
  kind of thing.” Significant work also goes into finding a new name that is
  legal, appropriate and matches the vision of a company. “The search for a
  legally available and trademarkable name is not to be underestimated,” said
  Sadie Dyer, strategy director at branding agency Siegel+Gale. “You generate
  hundreds and hundreds, for this, probably thousands of names, and go through a
  lot of internal reviews.” MSNBC faced a particularly challenging task since
  the “NBC” brand and its peacock logo is among the most iconic in US media.
  “You can’t compete with the peacock logo. That’s some of the best branding
  that there is,” said Dyer. “It’s distinctive, something that is historic and
  nostalgic. People have lots of connection with it.” Companies sometimes
  redefine themselves in ways that don’t sit well with consumers. Many people
  still refer to Elon Musk’s social media platform X as Twitter, though the
  company rebranded in 2023, and still refer to posts as “tweets”. The streaming
  wars has also seen the creation of new services, such as Peacock, Paramount
  Plus and HBO Max, which changed its name to “Max” before again changing its
  name, to HBO Max, this year. Casey Bloys, chair of HBO content, told the New
  York Times cable television has been having a hard time, branding-wise, with
  the transition to digital “and a bunch of other companies are trying to
  navigate that”. No matter what a company’s new name is, a change will likely
  draw its critics. People are drawn toward the familiar, and many will compare
  anything new to what had existed before. “It’s the nature of change. Even if
  it’s something that people look back on and fully follow you to the new name,
  it’s always going to result in people immediately resisting,” Dyer said.
  “You’re asking people to change their behavior and the name that they call
  you. That’s really tough, and it’s going to take a lot of work.”
