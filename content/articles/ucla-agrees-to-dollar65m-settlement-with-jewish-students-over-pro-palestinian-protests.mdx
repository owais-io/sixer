  The University of California, Los Angeles, will pay nearly $6.5m to settle a
  lawsuit by Jewish students and a professor who said the university allowed
  antisemitic discrimination to take place on campus during last year’s
  pro-Palestinian protests. The lawsuit alleged that with the “knowledge and
  acquiescence” of university officials, protesters prevented Jewish students
  from accessing parts of campus, and made antisemitic threats. Under the
  settlement agreement announced on Tuesday, the university admitted it had
  “fallen short” and agreed to pay $2.33m to eight groups that support UCLA’s
  Jewish community, $320,000 to a campus initiative to fight antisemitism, and
  $50,000 to each plaintiff. “We are pleased with the terms of today’s
  settlement. The injunction and other terms UCLA has agreed to demonstrate real
  progress in the fight against antisemitism,” the parties said in a joint
  statement provided by the University of California. On Tuesday, the Trump
  administration announced the US Department of Justice’s civil rights division
  found UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment and
  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, “by acting with deliberate
  indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and
  Israeli students”. “UCLA failed to take timely and appropriate action in
  response to credible claims of harm and hostility on its campus,” said Harmeet
  K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general of the justice department’s civil
  rights division. The university has said that it is committed to campus safety
  and will continue to implement recommendations. UCLA was the site of massive
  protests last year amid a wave of campus demonstrations nationwide in response
  to the war in Gaza, in which Israeli forces have killed more than 60,000
  Palestinians, which experts say is probably an undercount. The protests at
  UCLA attracted national attention, particularly after counter-protesters
  staged a violent attack on pro-Palestinian demonstrators. UCLA also faces a
  lawsuit from more than 30 pro-Palestinian protesters who say the university
  was negligent during the “brutal mob assault” on the encampment and that
  officials did not intervene. “This was four-plus hours of unmitigated violence
  while UCLA private security stood sometimes feet away and did nothing to
  protect the faculty, students and community members protesting genocide,”
  Thomas Harvey, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said earlier this year. The
  lawsuit that was settled this week was filed last year. This spring, the
  Department of Justice announced it would investigate the University of
  California system for possible antisemitic discrimination and violations of
  the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The university said it had taken “substantive
  action” to combat antisemitism, including publicizing information about campus
  bans on encampments, opposing calls to boycott Israel and publishing a
  systemwide anti-discrimination policy. “Antisemitism, harassment and other
  forms of intimidation are antithetical to our values and have no place at the
  University of California. We have been clear about where we have fallen short,
  and we are committed to doing better moving forward,” said Janet Reilly, the
  UC board of regents chair. “Today’s settlement reflects a critically important
  goal that we share with the plaintiffs: to foster a safe, secure and inclusive
  environment for all members of our community and ensure that there is no room
  for antisemitism anywhere.”
