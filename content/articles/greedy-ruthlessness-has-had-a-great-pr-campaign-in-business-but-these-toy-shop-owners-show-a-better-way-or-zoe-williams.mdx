  At the risk of sounding melodramatic, all toy shops give me a cold sweat and
  none make me feel remotely nostalgic. Toys R Us takes me to Christmas Eve
  circa 1985, trying to find the last brunette doll for my younger sister, who
  was implacably opposed to dolls that were blond, even while she herself was.
  John Lewis, 2009, eyeball to eyeball with a foe for the last 50% marked-down
  Buzz Lightyear; she was the very devil, wild-eyed and determined, but I could
  have been looking in a mirror. Hamleys, Christmas Eve again, 2015, trying to
  fabricate new interests for my six-year-old daughter, because I was against
  gendered playthings and we already had all the Nerf guns it was possible to
  have. I was anti-consumerist while consuming quite a lot, against plastic
  while simultaneously grossed out by other anti‑plastic parents, and didn’t
  want to raise spoilt little Fauntleroys yet at the same time hated saying
  “no”. It’s not easy holding on to that many contradictions or, if you prefer,
  being that dumb. One shop, The Entertainer, was an oasis by comparison,
  because it seemed angled towards the small and the cheap. Loom bands, Lol
  dolls, single-unit Lego men, mechanical puppies that could backflip – which
  can still make me stop and marvel (so agile and for only £9.99!) even now the
  kids are 17 and 15. The font on the shopfront looked cheap, too, and I mean
  that in the best possible way. It doesn’t surprise me to learn that the
  founders, Gary and Catherine Grant, built that up from a single unit, which
  they bought on loan in 1981, to a 160-store, multimillion-pound empire in the
  UK. They didn’t know anything about toys when they started, but they knew what
  parents wanted, which was not to have a nervous breakdown. But I was still
  amazed when they announced this morning that they would be transferring the
  business to an employee trust, so that it will soon be 100% owned by its
  workforce of nearly 2,000 people. The normal expectations of the self-made
  entrepreneur run as follows: it’s very male-coded, “self-made man” being the
  default, “self-made woman” sounding a bit like a grammatical error made in a
  foreign language. Nobody explains why, because the self-made man is too busy
  to explain, he is always shouting. (That bit comes from Alan Sugar; Lord love
  him, he actually doesn’t shout that much, he just deploys his plosives to
  dramatic effect and is very sure of himself. Let’s say he is shout-adjacent.)
  Having come from nothing, the generic self-made man is expected to put profit
  above everything – and considered noble for doing so. He hates handouts,
  complains about tax and doesn’t like plodders, which is to say, anyone who
  isn’t the boss – which is everyone, because he is, and how could there be two
  of him? Even while the terminology is very masculine, he can, of course, be
  female. If anything, that just makes her more of a one-off. Since astronomical
  wealth can be alienating to behold, self-made men generally take the edge off,
  rehumanising themselves with their devotion to family – again, it’s always
  “family man”; there is no such thing as a “family woman”. This, twinned with
  his or her admirably shark-like quest for profit, turns into a rationale for
  keeping all the money. It’s billed almost as a kind of altruism, that the
  self-made man will stop at nothing to give his or her children what he or she
  never had, with greed and rapacity washed away by the irrefutable logic of the
  entrepreneurial character. The Grants were known already as a different sort
  of self-made, cleaving to values other than profit as a result of their
  Christianity, most memorably when they refused to stock Harry Potter merch in
  the late 00s because they didn’t want children to experiment with “darkness”.
  It’s probably faith that has informed this decision, too, but they land an
  important point for the religious and irreligious: it’s not written in the
  stars that the price of profitability is carelessness and that all
  entrepreneurs are the same. The necessity of ruthlessness in business has had
  a hell of a PR campaign, but that doesn’t make it true. • Zoe Williams is a
