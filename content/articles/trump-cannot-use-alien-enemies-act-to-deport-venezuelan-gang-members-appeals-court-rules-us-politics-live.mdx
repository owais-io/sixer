  The Trump administration illegally deployed thousands of national guard troops
  in Los Angeles earlier this summer amid widespread protests against its
  immigration enforcement actions, a federal judged said on Tuesday. Judge
  Charles Breyer ruled in a case brought by the state of California that Donald
  Trump’s administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany
  federal agents on raids. In the order, set to take effect on 12 September,
  Breyer cited the president’s threats to send national guard troops to other
  cities across the country, “thus creating a national police force with the
  president as its chief”. In a statement, California’s governor, Gavin Newsom,
  praised the court’s ruling as a win for democracy and constitutional limits on
  presidential power, declaring: “No president is a king — not even Trump.” On
  social media, he marked the legal win with a Trumpian-style post: “DONALD
  TRUMP LOSES AGAIN,” adding, “The courts agree – his militarization of our
  streets and use of the military against US citizens is ILLEGAL.” Anna Kelly, a
  White House spokesperson, dismissed the ruling as judicial overreach and
  accused a “rogue judge” of trying to “usurp” Trump’s authority to respond to
  unrest and violence in American cities. “President Trump saved Los Angeles,
  which was overrun by deranged leftist lunatics sowing mass chaos until he
  stepped in,” Kelly said in a statement, vowing the legal fight was not over.
  The administration was expected to appeal the decision. Donald Trump has
  dismissed speculation that he is in ill health, saying he was busy on the
  Labor Day weekend giving media interviews and visiting his Virginia golf
  course. “I was very active over the weekend,” Trump, 79, told reporters in the
  Oval Office on Tuesday. Asked about rumours on social media that he may have
  died, he called them “fake news”. The president complained that he had done
  several news conferences last week “then I didn’t do any for two days and they
  said ‘there must be something wrong with him’.” “It’s so fake. ‘Is he OK,
  how’s he feeling, what’s wrong?’” Speculation about his health swirled on X
  over the weekend, with posts citing his lack of a public schedule late last
  week and a JD Vance interview in which the vice-president told USA Today he
  was confident the president was “in good shape” but suggested he was prepared
  to step in if anything happened to Trump. President Donald Trump will welcome
  Polish president Karol Nawrocki back to the White House on Wednesday after
  backing the conservative nationalist in Polish elections, with their meeting
  likely to focus on Russia’s war in Ukraine and energy security. Trump extended
  the invitation days after Nawrocki was sworn in early in August and then
  intervened to ensure he joined a key telephone call on Ukraine with European
  leaders instead of his rival, centrist Polish prime minister Donald Tusk,
  Reuters reported. The president hosted Nawrocki at the White House in May,
  backing him at a crucial moment in the Polish election. Nawrocki went on to
  defeat the candidate of Tusk’s pro-European, centrist party a month later.
  Wednesday’s talks are expected to center on stalled negotiations to end the
  war and Poland’s security concerns, amid signs that Trump has grown frustrated
  with Russian president Vladimir Putin for failing to move forward on ending
  the war. Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog for today. I am Tom
  Ambrose and I’ll be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few
  hours. We start with the news that a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday
  that president Donald Trump unlawfully invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport
  Venezuelans he alleged were part of a criminal gang. In a 2-1 decision, a
  three-judge panel of the Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals issued a
  preliminary injunction that blocked the Trump administration from removing a
  group of Venezuelans under the seldom-used 18th-century law, Reuters reported.
  The fifth circuit is the first federal appeals court to rule directly on a
  March 14 presidential proclamation invoking the 1798 law to justify rapid
  deportations. Circuit judge Leslie Southwick, writing for the two-judge
  majority, rejected the Trump administration’s assertion that the Venezuelan
  gang Tren de Aragua had engaged in a “predatory incursion” on US soil. The act
  gives the government expansive powers to detain and deport citizens of hostile
  foreign nations, but only in times of war, or during an “invasion or predatory
  incursion.” Southwick was appointed by former president George W Bush. He was
  joined by circuit judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez, an appointee of president Joe
  Biden. Circuit judge Andrew Oldham, a Trump appointee, dissented. The Trump
  administration could ask the entire 5th Circuit to rehear the case. It is
  expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court. “The Trump administration’s
  use of a wartime statute during peacetime to regulate immigration was rightly
  shut down by the court,” said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee
  Gelernt, who represented the Venezuelans. “This is a critically important
  decision reining in the administration’s view that it can simply declare an
  emergency without any oversight by the courts.” It comes as Trump claimed that
  the US military had killed 11 drug traffickers from Venezuela during a “a
  kinetic strike” in the Caribbean Sea. Trump trailed the announcement during an
  address at the White House on Tuesday afternoon, telling reporters the US had
  “just, over the last few minutes, literally shot out … a drug-carrying boat”.

  administration’s use of national guard troops during southern California
  immigration enforcement protests was illegal. Judge Charles Breyer ruled on
  Tuesday that the administration violated federal law by sending troops to
  accompany federal agents on immigration raids. The judge did not require the
  remaining troops withdrawn, however. The US House of Representatives oversight
  committee released thousands of pages of records related to the disgraced
  financier Jeffrey Epstein from the justice department. The 33,000 pages
  included years-old court filings related to Epstein and his former associate
  Ghislaine Maxwell as well as what appears to be body-cam footage from police
  searches and police interviews. Donald Trump has dismissed speculation that he
  is in ill health, saying he was busy on the Labor Day weekend giving media
  interviews and visiting his Virginia golf course. “I was very active over the
  weekend,” Trump, 79, told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. Asked about
  rumours on social media that he may have died, he called them “fake news”.
  Trump made his first public appearance in a week on Tuesday to announce that
  the US Space Command (Spacecom) headquarters, which is tasked with leading
  national security operations in space, would be in the Republican stronghold
  of Alabama. Flanked by Republican senators and members of Congress at a White
  House news conference, Trump said Huntsville, Alabama, would be the new
  location of the space command. Trump will welcome Polish president Karol
  Nawrocki back to the White House on Wednesday after backing the conservative
  nationalist in Polish elections, with their meeting likely to focus on
  Russia’s war in Ukraine and energy security. Trump extended the invitation
  days after Nawrocki was sworn in early in August and then intervened to ensure
  he joined a key telephone call on Ukraine with European leaders instead of his
  rival, centrist Polish prime minister Donald Tusk. The Kremlin said on
  Wednesday that Vladimir Putin was not conspiring with China’s Xi Jinping and
  North Korea’s Kim Jong Un against the United States, and suggested that
  perhaps president Trump was being ironic with his criticism. Trump said on
  Tuesday he was “very disappointed” with Putin, and suggested in a post on
  Truth Social that Xi, Putin and Kim were conspiring against the United States.
  Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is expected to say Britain has become an
  “authoritarian censorship regime” on a trip to the US after the arrest of
  Irish writer Graham Linehan. He is due to speak about free speech at the House
  Judiciary Committee later today.
