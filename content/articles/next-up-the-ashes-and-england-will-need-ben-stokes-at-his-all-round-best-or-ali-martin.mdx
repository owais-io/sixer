  The England-India epic that ended up like two weary prizefighters trading
  blows will live long in the memory – a 2‑2 classic for which the players on
  both sides deserve immense credit. Not that Mohammed Siraj, still hitting
  90mph on the speed gun on the 25th day, showed weariness. If anything, he
  could well hold the key to solving the world’s energy problems. Plaudits in
  particular go to three men who stepped up bravely when other sports would have
  simply subbed them off: Shoaib Bashir bowled with a broken left hand at
  Lord’s; Rishabh Pant batted with a broken foot at Old Trafford; and then Chris
  Woakes, Horatio Nelson armed with a Gray-Nicolls, followed him in folklore at
  the Oval. Don’t be fooled by the white flannels and the stoppages for tea –
  Test cricket is a brutal sport. It is also a sport of opinion, with one
  sticking out in the wash up: a common refrain that England getting over the
  line at the Oval to win 3-1 - ie the other side of one of the tightest games
  you’ll see - would have been a “travesty”. After all, India were the away
  side, dominated the run charts – four players in the top five – and had four
  of the six leading wicket-takers. They won more sessions, goes the argument,
  and lost all five tosses, indisputably. Sure. But a travesty? England chased
  down 371 to win at Headingley, defended a mere 193 at Lord’s, and then, at 2-1
  up, forced India into a remarkable rearguard at Old Trafford by sticking 669
  on the board – the highest total of the series. Had this been followed by 10
  men reeling in 374 at the Oval, their second‑highest run chase and breaking
  the ground’s 123-year-old record by 111 runs, 3-1 would surely have been well
  earned. None of which is to say a fair outcome was not landed upon. Shubman
  Gill’s never-say-die tourists won the deciding final round with a serious
  display of heart and skill. They were more than good value for the drawn
  series. The point is more that Test scorelines reflect all outputs – teams are
  only as strong as their weakest links – and even then can still come down to
  clutch moments or freak incidents. The 2009 Ashes, when Australia similarly
  dominated the runs and wickets charts yet lost 2-1, comes to mind. So does the
  next Ashes, inevitably – something which England’s head coach, Brendon
  McCullum, fancies his players will now be hardened for given the intensity of
  the cricket in the past six weeks. Although it is a concerning trend that in
  five of their past six series they have won the first Test and lost the last
  and no, with World Test Championship points at stake these days, none of them
  can be described as dead rubbers. The Ashes schedule thankfully has more
  generous spacing than the series just gone, with two nine-day breaks
  separating the first, second and third Tests. A cynic might wonder if it has
  been devised to get Australia’s great yet greybeard attack through what tends
  to be the “live” bit. Either way, this can only be a good thing, giving the
  best players the best chance to stay on the park and in turn producing the
  best possible spectacle. England will certainly not be complaining, with their
  fast‑bowling stocks stretched to breaking point against India. For all the
  promise of Jofra Archer’s 90mph-plus return, and Gus Atkinson with eight
  wickets on his Test comeback, it is hard to escape the sense that their hopes
  of competing in Australia hinge on Ben Stokes playing as a fully fledged
  all-rounder. This was his best series with the ball, 17 wickets at 25, quick
  and skilful. But bits still flew off and he ended it watching the finale from
  the sidelines. In terms of the batting, not a great deal has been learned,
  which is to say their strengths and weaknesses remain roughly the same:
  murderous when the conditions are in their favour, vulnerable when the ball
  moves, and pegged around the all-time greatness of Joe Root. Increased
  pragmatism? This did occur but chiefly when Jasprit Bumrah was playing, not
  least the steady climb to 387 at Lord’s with an uncharacteristic run-rate of
  3.44. The chase at the Oval has invited some criticism, some harsh – Harry
  Brook took them close only by playing the kind of shot to which he eventually
  got out – and some valid. They struggled to cope with a Dukes ball that swung
  late in its life (a turnaround from the ones that turned to mush earlier in
  the series). Leaning into their aggressive tendencies has served them well in
  the main but, as has been widely noted, the surfaces in Australia have been
  spicier of late. The Kookaburra ball’s seam stays prominent for longer, too.
  Perhaps the bigger miss was the final day at Edgbaston, rather than falling
  just short of their latest huge chase. After a morning lost to rain England
  were tasked with seeing out 80 overs from three down, aided by a flat pitch on
  which bowlers struggled for impact with the older ball. Yet they lasted just
  52.1 overs on the day. Compare and contrast with India seeing out five
  sessions in Manchester from a starting point of none for two (even if Root
  dropping Ravindra Jadeja first ball was another sliding doors moment). With no
  more Tests before the big push it appears only injury will dislodge the
  incumbents in the top seven. The sight of Stokes consoling Jacob Bethell after
  his tortured 31-ball five during the final collapse was probably driven in
  part by guilt at a young talent not exactly being given the best chance to
  succeed. Ollie Pope, even after another series that featured an early century
  but a final average of 34, will likely start at No 3 in Perth. All of which
  sounds a bit downbeat about a side that came within one hit of beating an
  India team who, save for Bumrah breaking down during the deciding Sydney Test,
  might well have drawn 2-2 in Australia earlier this year. Nevertheless, they
  will need to improve in a number of areas if they are to change the
  perceptions in that part of the world.
