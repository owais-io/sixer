  Doctors have found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart
  attacks and strokes, in a discovery that could transform health guidelines
  worldwide. For decades, millions of people have been advised to take aspirin
  to reduce their risk of experiencing a serious cardiovascular event. A daily
  low-dose aspirin makes blood less sticky and helps prevent heart attacks and
  strokes. But now a new study, presented at the world’s largest heart
  conference, has found that clopidogrel, a commonly prescribed blood thinner,
  is more effective – and with no extra risk. The stunning discovery was
  revealed at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Madrid, with the
  data behind the findings simultaneously published in the Lancet medical
  journal. The international team of medics behind the study, from countries
  including the US, UK, Australia, Switzerland and Japan, said the results
  showed that clopidogrel was “superior” to aspirin and should lead to
  “extensive adoption” of the drug in clinical practice worldwide. Their
  comprehensive analysis of nearly 29,000 patients with coronary artery disease
  (CAD) found that clopidogrel was better than aspirin in preventing serious
  heart and stroke events, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. CAD is
  the most common form of heart disease and a leading cause of death and
  disability globally. More than 300 million people live with CAD, including 2.3
  million in the UK. It occurs when arteries in the heart become narrowed by a
  buildup of atheroma, a fatty material within their walls. The pain or
  discomfort felt from such narrowing is called angina and if a blockage occurs,
  it can cause a heart attack. The findings challenge the longstanding
  recommendation of aspirin as the default treatment for preventing serious
  cardiovascular events in hundreds of millions of CAD patients. CAD often
  requires lifelong treatment to prevent heart attacks, strokes and
  cardiovascular death. Aspirin has traditionally been prescribed indefinitely
  for patients with the condition. However, the evidence supporting aspirin’s
  long-term benefits and safety has been limited. The new analysis of seven
  clinical trials found that patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of
  major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events – including heart
  attack, stroke or cardiovascular death – compared with those taking aspirin.
  Importantly, the rates of major bleeding issues in patients were similar
  between the two drugs, dispelling concerns that clopidogrel might lead to more
  bleeding complications. Writing in the Lancet, the study team said: “This
  comprehensive synthesis of available evidence indicates that, in patients with
  CAD, long-term clopidogrel monotherapy offers superior protection against
  major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events compared with aspirin, without
  an excess risk of bleeding. “The superior efficacy of clopidogrel v aspirin
  was consistent across multiple key subgroups, including individuals with
  clinical features predictive of poor clopidogrel responsiveness, supporting
  the generalisability of these findings to the broad spectrum of patients with
  CAD. “These results support a preference for clopidogrel over aspirin for
  chronic antiplatelet monotherapy for patients with stable CAD. The widespread
  availability, generic formulation and affordability of clopidogrel further
  supports its potential for extensive adoption in clinical practice.” The
  analysis drew from diverse patient groups, including those who had undergone
  procedures such as stent placement or had experienced acute coronary syndrome,
  and examined various subgroups to ensure the findings applied broadly.
  Notably, even patients who might respond less well to clopidogrel as a result
  of genetic or clinical factors still benefited from its use over aspirin. The
  results suggest that clopidogrel should be considered the preferred long-term
  anti-platelet medication for patients with CAD. Because both medications are
  widely available, the findings have the potential to influence clinical
  guidelines worldwide and improve patient outcomes. Further research on the
  cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel, as well as broader population studies, will
  be needed to support changes in treatment standards. Prof Bryan Williams, the
  chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation, said:
  “Aspirin is a commonly prescribed drug to help prevent repeat heart attacks
  and strokes. This research suggests that clopidogrel, an alternative to
  aspirin, might be more effective at preventing recurrent heart attack or
  stroke. “Importantly, these benefits come without a greater risk of major
  bleeding. These findings are likely to impact the medications doctors
  prescribe to their patients to reduce their risk of future heart problems.”
