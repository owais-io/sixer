  Goodness knows what the man who was not there made of it all. Might Alexander
  Isak have felt the tiniest bit guilty at the sight of his increasingly
  overwrought understudy, Anthony Gordon, missing a couple of extremely
  presentable chances before being sent off for a ridiculous first-half tackle
  on Virgil van Dijk? And how did Newcastle’s currently striking star striker
  assess Hugo Ekitiké’s attacking performance for Liverpool? Even as Isak
  continues to endeavour to engineer a move to Anfield, did he celebrate Will
  Osula’s unexpected late Newcastle leveller to make it 2-2? What, precisely,
  did he feel when the 16-year-old visiting substitute Rio Ngumoha won it for
  the champions in the 100th minute? Given that the Sweden striker was watching
  from up the road in Northumberland, we will never know, but one thing was
  abundantly clear: the emotions engendered by the summer’s longest and most
  acrimonious transfer saga provoked a night of compelling, sometimes downright
  wild drama. As Liverpool’s manager Arne Slot said afterwards: “I’m not sure it
  was a football match today.” By kick-off it had been dubbed “El Isako” and
  Ryan Gravenberch’s booking for a wince-inducing tackle on Bruno Guimarães
  swiftly set the tone as this 100mph rerun of last season’s Carabao Cup final
  opened in highly charged, almost anarchic mode. If Liverpool wanted revenge
  for that Wembley defeat, the sheer, feral fury of a Newcastle crowd incensed
  by Slot’s pursuit of Isak and Liverpool’s perceived audacity in hijacking
  Howe’s move for Ekitiké transmitted itself to an electrically charged home
  team. Before too long Gordon would self-destruct but, for a while, he rattled
  Liverpool. The England winger, once again deputising for Isak out of position
  at centre-forward, may not be exactly reliable in front of goal but he remains
  extremely clever at winning dangerous free-kicks. Accordingly Slot twice lost
  his cool after complaining that Gordon dives had earned Newcastle underserved
  set-pieces. It was left to a deep-sitting Van Dijk and company to stay calm
  and slow the tempo at every opportunity. At times they lived dangerously and
  Alisson Becker looked relieved to see Gordon head fractionally over the bar
  from Harvey Barnes’s cross. But the impressive approach work of the excellent
  Sandro Tonali was repeatedly undone by the lack of a specialist striker. The
  directors’ box contained Newcastle’s chair, Yasir al-Rumayyan – making a rare
  visit from Riyadh – flanked by a sizeable, and serious looking delegation from
  the club’s owners, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. On Monday
  afternoonsome members of that delegation joined Newcastle’s minority owner,
  Jamie Reuben, in visiting Isak at home to try to persuade him into a change of
  heart. Considering that earlier in the day Wolves had rejected a £50m bid from
  St James’ Park for their striker Jørgen Strand Larsen, the boardroom chat with
  Liverpool executives can hardly have been dull. Neither was a match that was
  initially dominated by a home side who, nonetheless, fell behind when an
  unsighted Nick Pope was beaten by Gravenberch’s low, slightly deflected shot
  from the edge of the area in the 35th minute. Pope enjoyed a reprieve when
  Mohamed Salah’s subtly curving cross proved just slightly too clever for a
  startled looking Ekitiké. But then an intervention by the video assistant
  referee resulted in Gordon’s dismissal for poleaxing Van Dijk with an
  unpleasant, unnecessary and utterly brainless tackle from behind. Given that
  it involved the boyhood Liverpool fan lunging into the back of the defender’s
  standing leg as Van Dijk attempted to clear the ball, Gordon could hardly
  complain. Howe’s players had arguably paid the price for playing on the edge.
  Initially all this black-and-white adrenaline had unnerved and unsettled
  Slot’s side but, not for the first time, Gordon carried things too far and
  imploded. Slot had not even emerged from the tunnel when, 23 seconds into the
  second half, Ekitiké showed Newcastle precisely what they are missing. The
  Frenchman’s burst beyond Tonali and his pass to the left cued up Cody Gakpo.
  When the Dutchman’s ensuing shot was blocked, Ekitiké reacted first to the
  rebound, drilling an unstoppable shot past Pope. Either side of their goals,
  Liverpool had taken surprisingly few touches in Newcastle’s area but their
  efficiency when it mattered most had hurt their hosts. Not that it was quite
  over just yet. When Tino Livramento curled a cross into the area, Guimarães
  capitalised on slapdash defending by Milos Kerkez to head Newcastle’s 10 men
  right back into things in the 57th minute. Suddenly Liverpool almost looked
  the team at a numerical disadvantage, but then injuries began stemming the
  tide of the black-and-white waves. Newcastle could certainly have done without
  losing Tonali, with a nasty looking shoulder injury, before the influential
  Joelinton limped off as Jacob Ramsey stepped off the bench to make his home
  debut following a £40m move from Aston Villa. Ramsey, though, was not the
  night’s most influential home substitute. That accolade belonged to Osula. The
  Denmark Under-21 forward may not be quite the finished article but he is at
  least a proper centre-forward and when Dan Burn overpowered Ibrahima Konaté in
  the tussle to meet Pope’s long kick, he nipped in, stretched out a boot and
  equalised with two minutes of normal time to go. Unfortunately for Howe a
  visiting replacement proved an even bigger gamechanger. Ngumoha marked his
  Premier League debut by becoming the youngest scorer in Liverpool’s history
  after curling a sumptuous shot beyond Pope at the end of a gloriously fluent
  attacking move. Maybe Slot doesn’t need Isak after all.
