  Lily Phillips: Crying review – laughing through the toxic positivity around
  childbirth
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-10T08:00:18Z'
bodyText: >-
  Expectations and reality don’t always align when it comes to childbirth. Lily
  Phillips (not that one, she assures us, getting good mileage from her porn
  star namesake) thought she was well informed. She’d gone through a long
  process of IVF to get there, attended NCT classes, and, when labour started,
  she was ready for the if not serene then empowering birthing experience and
  magical moment of immediate love that would follow. Instead, she discovered
  that “birth is barbaric and early motherhood is brutal”. Yet even her NCT
  WhatsApp group, where she turned after a harrowing hospital experience,
  requested “no negative birth stories, please”. Crying does a lot to redress
  the balance and cuts through the “toxic positivity” surrounding childbirth
  that left Phillips feeling alone. Phillips is an assured yet irreverent host,
  breezing through anecdotes of medical examinations, unspeakable pain, and
  struggles to have her concerns acknowledged by those looking after her. She
  takes us to the depths of her three-day labour with amusing vignettes of
  arrogant consultants and undignified poos, and the “hell” of sleep deprivation
  that descended into postnatal depression. Most of all, she tells us, there was
  anger. We feel the righteousness of that, yet Phillips also withholds the raw
  emotion. She keeps it light, cushioning pain with exasperation that any of
  this has been normalised. Some of the routines stick to documenting her
  experience rather than wringing out their full comic potential, and
  interesting questions about why the expectations from Instagram and antenatal
  classes don’t match most women’s reality are raised but not probed. She’s not
  the only show at this festival to note the persisting gender gap in parenting
  within heterosexual relationships, but she does it with aplomb. Despite a
  couple’s best intentions, “the baby doesn’t give a shit about him”, she quips
  – to the newborn, she’s Beyoncé, he’s Alan Titchmarsh. Phillips says she never
  wanted to write a show about her baby, but audiences will be glad she did. •
