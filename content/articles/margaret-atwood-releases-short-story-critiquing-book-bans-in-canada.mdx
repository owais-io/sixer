  Margaret Atwood has released a new short story critiquing elected officials
  for a wide-ranging book ban in the Canadian province of Alberta. The
  controversial decision to remove books purportedly containing “explicit sexual
  content” has seen numerous works of literature swept up in the dragnet,
  including Atwood’s, dystopian work The Handmaid‘s Tale. In a social media
  post, Atwood wrote that since her famed work was no longer permissible in
  Alberta schools, she had written a “suitable” short work for teens, adding the
  work was necessary because the province’s minister of education thought
  students were “stupid babies”. The extremely brief story traces the lives of
  John and Mary, two “very, very good” children. “They never picked their noses
  or had bowel movements or zits,” she wrote in the opening lines, adding they
  were ardent Christians who “paid no attention to what Jesus actually said
  about the poor” and instead “practised selfish rapacious capitalism” in the
  vein of the conservative literary hero Ayn Rand. “Oh, and they never died,
  because who wants to dwell on, you know, death and corpses and yuk?” Atwood
  writes that while the pair “lived happily ever”, the ominous warnings in her
  1985 novel The Handmaid’s Tale – which describes a totalitarian fundamentalist
  regime in which enslaved women are forced to bear children – “came true came
  true and [Alberta premier] Danielle Smith found herself with a nice new blue
  dress but no job” – a reference to the novel’s elite wives who have power but
  are not permitted to work. “The end.” The Alberta ban emerged as a product of
  intense lobbying by socially conservative “parents’ rights” groups in the
  province and mirrors a trend in the United States. Action4Canada and Parents
  for Choice in Education (PCE), have taken credit for the book ban and the
  latter sent an email to supporters after the ban was announced thanking them
  for their efforts in contacting government officials about “graphic” books.
  The Alberta government defines “explicit sexual content” in its policy as
  “content containing a detailed and clear depiction of a sexual act”. Students
  from kindergarten to grade 12 cannot access any “content” in a school library
  that meets this definition. Alberta’s public schools have until October to
  comply with the order, but some schools have already released their lists of
  banned books. The Edmonton school board said it would remove 200 books from
  school libraries, including The Handmaid’s Tale. Other books to be pulled from
  shelves include George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, which officials say
  contains passages that discuss sexual intercourse and rape; Maya Angelou’s I
  Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World. Last week,
  Smith criticised officials for drawing up such a wide-ranging list of books to
  be removed, describing the move as “vicious compliance”. Smith showed
  reporters excerpts from graphic novels– including Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe
  – that prompted the new rules in the first place for the explicit
  illustrations of sexual acts they contain. The book is a globally acclaimed
  coming-of-age story about teenage life and young adulthood. Critics of the ban
  say increasingly powerful lobby groups are targeting books that affirm LGBTQ+
  identities. Ahead of the ban, Atwood also posted on social media warning
  against reading The Handmaid’s Tale because “your hair will catch on fire!”
  “Get one now before they have public book burnings of it.”
