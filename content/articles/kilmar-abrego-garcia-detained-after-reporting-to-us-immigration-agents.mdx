  Kilmar Ábrego García – who has been thrust into the middle of an acrimonious
  deportation saga by the second Trump administration – has been detained after
  reporting to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents in Baltimore on
  Monday. “The only reason he was taken into detention was to punish him,” Simon
  Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney representing Ábrego, told a crowd of
  supporters outside a Baltimore Ice field office on Monday. The attorney also
  said his client filed a new lawsuit on Monday morning challenging his
  potential deportation to Uganda and his current confinement. Ábrego faces
  deportation to Uganda after recently declining an offer to be deported to
  Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human
  smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing. Ábrego entered the US
  without permission in about 2011 as a teenager after fleeing gang violence. He
  was subsequently afforded a federal protection order against deportation to El
  Salvador. The 30-year-old was initially deported by federal immigration
  officials in March. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego’s
  deportation was an “administrative error”, officials have repeatedly accused
  him of being affiliated with the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family
  vehemently deny. During his detention at El Salvador’s so-called Terrorism
  Confinement Center (Cecot), Ábrego was physically and psychologically
  tortured, according to court documents filed by his lawyers in July. Following
  Ábrego’s wrongful deportation, the Trump administration faced widespread
  pressure to return him to the US, including from a supreme court order that
  directed federal officials to “facilitate” his return. In June, the Trump
  administration returned Ábrego from El Salvador, only to charge him with
  crimes related to human smuggling, which his lawyers have rejected as
  “preposterous”. His criminal trial is expected to begin in January. Check back
  later for more details
