  Taylor Swift has announced her next album, The Life of a Showgirl. Swift is
  known for dropping hints and clues for her fans ahead of announcements and
  this one was no different. On Monday night, a countdown to 12.12am eastern
  time on 12 August appeared on her website, transformed to a glittering orange.
  On Instagram, Taylor Nation – a branch of Swift’s official marketing team –
  shared a carousel of 12 images from the Eras Tour, writing in the caption:
  “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era … ’” It was also announced
  that Swift will appear on her partner Travis Kelce’s podcast New Heights on
  Wednesday. Eagle-eyed Swifties noticed the silhouette of Swift was taken from
  her Variety Directors on Directors appearance, which premiered on 12 December
  2022. The Variety recording was connected to All Too Well: The Short Film,
  which was released on 12 November 2021. At 12.12am Swift’s website briefly
  crashed, before reappearing with scant details about The Life of a Showgirl.
  The album has no confirmed release date. Swift’s website states that it will
  be shipped before 13 October, with the caveat: “**THIS IS NOT THE RELEASE
  DATE, OFFICIAL RELEASE DATE TO BE ANNOUNCED**.” The New Heights podcast later
  shared a clip of Swift’s appearance, in which she opens a briefcase and takes
  out a blurred vinyl. “This is my brand new album, The Life of a Showgirl,” she
  said, while Kelce’s brother and co-host Jason screamed. The 35-year-old is
  among the world’s bestselling musicians, selling an estimated 200m records
  globally and holds the record for most No 1 albums in the US by a female
  artist in history. Her global Eras tour became the first billion-dollar tour
  in history, selling 2.4m tickets in a single day, and made more than US$2bn
  over 21 months. Forbes estimated Swift earned $10m-$13m (£8m-£10m) a night.
  Her last album, 2024’s The Tortured Poets Department, set a streaming record
  on Spotify – 300m in one day and 1bn in five – and made her the first artist
  in history to secure the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100. In May, Swift
  bought back the master recordings to her first six albums, giving her control
  over her entire catalogue for the first time. The singer signed with her first
  label, Big Machine, in 2005, at the age of 15, giving them the rights to her
  master recordings. In 2019, label head Scott Borchetta sold those six albums
  to music executive Scooter Braun, who sold them to the private equity firm
  Shamrock Capital for a reported $300m. To regain control over her catalogue
  after the sale to Braun – and to devalue his investment – Swift embarked on a
  project to rerecord all six albums, rebranding each one as “(Taylor’s
  Version)” and adding “From the Vault” tracks from the original songwriting
  sessions that hadn’t made it on to the original albums. “I almost stopped
  thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and
  then yanked away,” she wrote in a letter to fans in May, after buying her
  catalogue back from Shamrock Capital. “But that’s all in the past now. All of
  the music I’ve ever made … now belongs … to me.” Reputation and Swift’s
  self-titled debut album, from 2006, are the only albums not to be rerecorded,
  with fans speculating as to their possible release dates for years. Despite
  the project now being essentially redundant, it is likely both will have a
  Taylor’s Version released anyway as Swift remains one of the biggest and most
  lucrative musical acts in the history of music.
