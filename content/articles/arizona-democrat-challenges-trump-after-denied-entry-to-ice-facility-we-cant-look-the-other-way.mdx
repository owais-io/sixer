  can’t look the other way’

  An Arizona congressman says the US government violated federal law when it
  refused to allow him to visit a local restaurant owner held in an immigration
  detention facility last week. Greg Stanton, who represents Arizona’s fourth
  congressional district, is the latest in a series of Democrats who have been
  denied entry into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention
  facilities, despite members of Congress’s legal right to conduct oversight
  without notice at places that detain migrants. Stanton said he expects to take
  legal action to hold the Trump administration accountable for violating this
  law. “Every time the Trump administration violates the law – whether it’s
  through impoundment or illegal terminations of government employees or
  systematic denial of due process rights, or denying members of Congress their
  obligation and right to visit a detention center – it all has to be challenged
  legally,” Stanton said. “We can’t look the other way. This is we operate under
  the rule of law, and this administration does not get to violate the rule of
  law. You can imagine that we will seek recourse.” Other Democratic members of
  Congress have experienced similar denials since Donald Trump’s return to the
  White House. In one instance in May, LaMonica McIver, a New Jersey
  representative, was charged with assaulting and interfering with immigration
  officials after seeking entry into a detention center under her right to
  congressional oversight of these facilities. A dozen members of the US House
  filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against the Trump administration over obstructing
  congressional oversight of immigration detention facilities. The members say
  the Trump administration’s policy to require advance notice and approval is
  illegal and demand that the administration allow these visits without prior
  notice. Stanton was trying to visit Kelly Yu, who owns a sushi restaurant, in
  custody in the Eloy detention center in Eloy, Arizona, where she has been
  detained since late May. Yu’s husband requested that Stanton check on her
  after community members connected the family to the congressman’s office. Yu
  has lived in the US for more than 20 years and is an “incredible success
  story”, Stanton said. She’s a restaurateur who provides jobs for others in the
  community, contributes to local organizations and is involved in her local
  area, he said. She has never been in trouble with the law, but was denied
  asylum first in 2005. She has been trying to get citizenship and was picked up
  while attending a monthly check-in with immigration, 12News in Phoenix
  reported. Stanton said he wanted to check on Yu’s condition, highlight her
  case and observe conditions in the facility. Her story “does make the case
  that mass deportation is not good for this country”, Stanton said. “Targeted
  deportation of people that have committed violent crimes everyone agrees with,
  but deporting people that are such strong community members, have been here
  for 20-plus years and are making significant contributions – that doesn’t make
  sense.” At the Eloy facility, local immigration officials told him they would
  be following guidance from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about
  congressional visits, which they told him now requires a request at least
  seven days in advance of a visit. He brought a copy of federal law with him,
  which doesn’t mandate advance notice or approval, but the officials didn’t
  budge. The DHS instituted the advance notice policy in June, after Democratic
  officials across the country have repeatedly tried to tour facilities and
  visit detained members of their communities. The visits are one way Democrats
  are trying to hold Trump accountable amid mass deportations and his
  administration’s flouting of the law. After he was denied entry, Stanton made
  a request via the DHS directive, but he hasn’t heard back yet about whether
  he’ll be granted a visit. And besides, he said, the department is clearly
  violating the law by requiring advance notice and denying members of Congress
  entry. “You don’t get to pick and choose which laws you follow,” he said. “And
  it may be inconvenient to have a member of Congress show up and try to do
  their duty of oversight, but that doesn’t matter. This is what the law says,
  and you’ve got to follow the law.”
