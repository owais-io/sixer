  An “entirely man-made” famine is taking place in Gaza’s largest city and its
  surrounding area amid deteriorating conditions that threaten an exponential
  increase in deaths across the devastated territory, UN-backed experts have
  declared. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally
  recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and
  malnutrition, found that three key thresholds for famine had been met,
  signalling a major escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Only four
  famines have been declared by the IPC since it was established in 2004, most
  recently in Sudan last year. “This famine is entirely man-made, it can be
  halted and reversed,” the report says. “The time for debate and hesitation has
  passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading. There should be no
  doubt in anyone’s mind that an immediate, at-scale response is needed. Any
  further delay – even by days – will result in a totally unacceptable
  escalation of famine-related mortality. “If a ceasefire is not implemented to
  allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential
  food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services
  are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially.”
  The IPC warned in July that a “famine scenario” was unfolding in parts of Gaza
  but until now it had stopped short of making a formal declaration, citing a
  lack of hard data. In addition to a famine in and around Gaza City, the
  biggest built-up area of the territory and home to between 500,000 and 800,000
  people, the report declares that the towns of Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis in
  the centre and south of Gaza are likely to experience famine “in coming
  weeks”. The experts say the data is insufficient to declare a famine in the
  north of the territory, though aid officials say the conditions there are
  thought to be the most severe and have called for urgent steps to allow for a
  full humanitarian assessment. Ibtisam Saleh, 50, who lives in Gaza City, said
  she and her 29-year-old son had been eating one meal a day for weeks, and many
  times they had nothing at all. “I cook only lentils, nothing else is available
  to us,” she told the Guardian. “Yesterday a donor gave us a small bag of rice.
  As for food kitchens, I cannot eat their food, it makes my stomach hurt if I
  taste it. And I do not have the strength to stand in line waiting to get my
  share.” In order to declare a famine, strict criteria must be met: at least
  20% of households face an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children
  suffer from acute malnutrition; and two people for every 10,000 die each day
  due to “outright starvation”. The declaration of famine in Gaza will increase
  pressure on Israel to ease the tight restrictions it has maintained on
  supplies since the beginning of the 22-month-old conflict. David Lammy,
  Britain’s foreign secretary, condemned the famine as a “moral outrage”. “The
  confirmation of famine in Gaza City and the surrounding neighbourhood is
  utterly horrifying and is wholly preventable,” he said in a statement. “The
  Israeli government’s refusal to allow sufficient aid into Gaza has caused this
  man-made catastrophe.” Amjad Shawa, the director of the Gaza NGOs Network, who
  is based in Gaza City, said: “This is the worst, the most critical stage in
  the entire history of Gaza, not just in this war. We are in a very complicated
  situation. We feel very sick and very tired. We must get food otherwise we
  cannot imagine what will happen.” Israel rejected the findings the report,
  claiming there was no famine in Gaza and that the findings were based on
  “Hamas lies laundered through organisations with vested interests”. Benjamin
  Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, has said Israeli forces will launch a
  massive new assault on Gaza City within weeks. Aid officials said any further
  offensives in Gaza would have catastrophic consequences for the population.
  The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israel-backed organisation that was
  supposed to replace aid groups that previously distributed food to much of the
  population in Gaza, is failing to distribute sufficient food. The UN and other
  organisations face massive logistical obstacles including widespread looting
  due to an almost total breakdown of the rule of law, ongoing Israeli combat
  operations, Israel’s administrative restrictions and bureaucracy and damaged
  infrastructure within Gaza. Riham Kraiem, 35, who is living in a tent in Gaza
  City, said her eldest son, 13, had travelled to the aid distribution areas in
  the north of Gaza, risking his life in largely fruitless efforts to bring food
  for the family of 10. “My children’s health … is now very poor,” she said.
  “There’s nothing nutritious for them to eat. I can’t provide proper food to
  support their bodies. My four-year-old daughter’s condition is deteriorating,
  she is suffering from malnutrition and is sick because of it. “I have no food
  supplies left. We left some behind in our home when we fled and the house was
  destroyed. Yesterday my son went again to look for aid and got one kilogram of
  pasta and a can of tomato sauce. He didn’t get it from the aid distribution, a
  young man there gave it to him. He came back feeling like he was flying from
  happiness.” The IPC report expresses grave concern at the continued and
  large-scale killing of civilians while trying to access food deliveries and
  the inadequate planning, implementation and monitoring of the privatised food
  distributions conducted by the GHF. It calls for “urgent, comprehensive and
  sustained action to end the swiftly deteriorating and ever-expanding
  humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip”. According to figures from Gaza’s
  health ministry, verified by the World Health Organization, deaths from
  malnutrition and starvation in Gaza have risen sharply. In the 22 months after
  the 7 October attacks by Hamas, 89 deaths were attributed to malnutrition or
  starvation, mostly children under 18. In the first 20 days of August there
  were 133 deaths, including 25 under-18s, the ministry said on Wednesday.
  Israel disputes the hunger fatality figures given by the health ministry of
  Gaza’s Hamas-run government, arguing that the deaths were due to other medical
  causes. Israeli officials said more than 220 aid trucks entered Gaza through
  the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings on Thursday.
