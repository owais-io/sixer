  While I await an assessment of Nicola Sturgeon’s career from a non-unionist
  perspective from the fair-minded Guardian, I’ll take issue with Martin Kettle
  on just one of his criticisms (Nicola Sturgeon’s immense political talent is
  undeniable, 14 August). He states that Sturgeon’s “gender recognition reforms
  were dogmatic and divisive”. After lengthy consultation, the gender
  recognition reform (Scotland) bill was passed by the Scottish parliament with
  a significant majority, the Conservatives being the only party voting against.
  If it had been enacted, Scotland would have aligned with the majority of
  European countries on this issue. However, the UK government used section 35
  of the Scotland Act to stop it. So the dogma and divisiveness came from the
  UK, not Sturgeon or the Scottish government, and Scotland and the UK remain
  conservative outliers in Europe with regard to trans rights. John Warburton
  Edinburgh • It was the fact that Nicola Sturgeon was a personable
  working-class woman with strong values that made the contrast between her and
  Boris Johnson so stark. Is it her support for independence that led to cold
  treatment in the British media? The headline on Martin Kettle’s article
  suggests so. But this raises the question of whether being pro-union is really
  less nationalistic than being pro-independence. In any case, many Scots
  remember Nicola fondly, something that can’t be said for many of this island’s
  recent political leaders. Duncan Macrae Inverness • Have an opinion on
