  Apple has been under pressure this year. It’s playing catch-up to its fellow
  tech giants on artificial intelligence, it’s seen its stock fall by double
  digits since the year began, it closed a store in China for the first time
  ever this week, and looming US tariffs on Beijing threaten its supply chain.
  On Thursday, the company released its third-quarter earnings of the fiscal
  year as investors scrutinize how the iPhone maker might turn things around.
  Despite the gloomy outlook, the company is still worth more than $3tn, and it
  beat Wall Street’s expectations for profit and revenue this quarter. Apple
  reported a huge 10% year-over-year increase in revenue to $94.04bn, and $1.57
  per share in earnings. That’s substantially more than the $89.3bn in revenue
  and $1.43 per share that analysts predicted and is the company’s biggest
  revenue growth since 2021. Apple’s iPhone revenue also outperformed Wall
  Street’s expectations, coming in 13% higher than the same time last year. Tim
  Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said in a statement that the company was
  “proud” to report a “June quarter revenue record”, showing growth in its
  iPhone, Mac and services divisions. On an earnings call on Thursday, he said
  the quarterly results were “better than we expected”. Dipanjan Chatterjee, a
  vice-president and principal analyst for Forrester, said rising services tend
  to boost the company’s revenue stream. “Apple has grown accustomed to having
  revenue growth in this high-margin services business, which masks other areas
  of the business not performing as well,” Chatterjee explained . He pointed to
  several issues that had led to Apple’s less-than-stellar product performance
  of late. He said Apple had lagged on hardware innovation, causing “consumer
  apathy”, and its AI rollout had been glitchy. Apple Intelligence, Apple’s AI
  product, has been limited to incremental features and rather than
  transformational upgrades. And it’s been more than a year since Apple
  announced a suite of AI upgrades to its voice assistant Siri – many of which
  have yet to be released. “This work [on Siri] needed more time to reach our
  high-quality bar,” said Craig Federighi, Apple’s vice-president of software
  engineering, during the company’s developer conference in June. Donald Trump’s
  sweeping tariffs have also been a pain point for the company as the US
  president pushes his desire for manufacturing to boom in the US. The vast
  majority of Apple’s products are made in China, with about 90% of iPhones
  assembled there, despite recent efforts to shift production elsewhere. Cook
  said during the company’s previous quarterly earnings call that he expected
  the China tariffs to add $900m to its costs this quarter. Apple has attempted
  to pivot, moving more of its manufacturing to other countries such as India
  and Vietnam. However, this week, Trump announced a rise in tariffs on India,
  too, up to 25% starting on 1 August. On Thursday’s earnings call, Cook
  reminded analysts that Apple had pledged to invest $500bn in the US over the
  next four years and that “ultimately we will do more in the United States”. He
  added Apple was “making good progress on a more personalized Siri” and
  promised a release next year. Because of the external and internal pressures,
  Apple has seen its share price plummet this year. Once the industry leader of
  the “Magnificent Seven” – the most valuable publicly traded companies in the
  world, all American technology giants – Apple boasted the highest-performing
  stock and biggest market capitalization on the US stock market. Now its share
  price is the second-worst performing after Tesla in percentage decline among
  the seven. Since January, Apple’s stock has fallen roughly 15%. In after-hours
  trading on Thursday, though, the company saw a slight increase of 2.5% in its
  share price.
