  Canada’s Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has won a closely watched
  byelection in the province of Alberta, giving him a chance to return to
  parliament after suffering a shock defeat in April’s federal election.
  Poilievre finished with 80.4% of the vote after Monday’s election in the
  riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, in the deeply Conservative western province.
  “Thank you very much to the great people of Battle River-Crowfoot,” Poilievre
  told supporters as he celebrated the victory with his family in the city of
  Camrose. “If I stand before you here today, it is by the grace of God and the
  good generosity of so many people … Getting to know the people in this region
  has been the privilege of my life.” Poilievre, the leader of the opposition,
  lost the seat he had held for more than 20 years in April’s national election.
  He now replaces Damien Kurek, who volunteered to resign his seat in order to
  give Poilievre a chance return to parliament. Without a seat in the House of
  Commons, Poilievre has been unable to fully serve his role as opposition
  leader. Instead of sparring with the prime minister, Mark Carney, during
  question period, Poilievre has been relegated to holding media scrums on the
  outskirts of parliament, diminishing his national visibility. Monday’s
  victory, with relatively high turnout for a byelection, is likely to
  re-energize supporters. But Poilievre won one of the country’s most
  Conservative-friendly seats by a narrower margin than Kurek did in April.
  Diminished support for the federal leader could influence members when they
  vote to review his tenure as the top Tory in January. The race, which had a
  national feel for a rural, sparsely populated riding, was also the target of
  the Longest Ballot Committee, a group calling for electoral reform. The
  movement coaxed 203 candidates to add their names to the roster, forcing
  Elections Canada to use write-in ballots for the first time during a federal
  election and to hire more staff to count ballots on election night. “Make your
  vote count so that I can go to Ottawa and fight for you. Fight for your right
  to buy any truck or car you want. To keep your firearms, fight for farmers,
  oil and gas workers, and a stronger military. Fight for an immigration system
  that is under control and puts Canadians first,” Poilievre said in a video
  posted to social media on Monday, which included directions on how to
  correctly spell his surname. “But before I can do any of that, I need you to
  get out and vote today.”
