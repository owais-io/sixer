  A Liberian-born man detained by Ice in Georgia was put in solitary confinement
  after complaining about flooding in the common area outside his cell at the
  Stewart detention center that he said was potentially dangerous for his
  electronic prosthetic legs, the Guardian can reveal. Rodney Taylor recently
  spent three days in what CoreCivic calls a “restrictive housing unit” at
  Georgia’s Stewart detention center, after refusing to enter his cell because
  faulty air conditioning had left the floor in the area outside his cell
  covered with about an inch of water. That would be a potential disaster for
  Taylor, since his battery-powered, microprocessor-controlled prosthetic legs
  can’t get wet. It was only the latest episode for Taylor, a double amputee,
  since Ice agents detained him at his Loganville, Georgia, home on 15 January.
  His problems illustrate how ill-prepared the Trump administration is to meet
  the needs of immigration detainees with disabilities as they carry out mass
  deportation plans. “They don’t see you as an individual, but as someone being
  deported,” Taylor said. Taylor’s fiancee, Mildred Pierre, called the
  experience of monitoring his wellbeing during the last six months like
  “receiving blow after blow”. The Guardian first reported on Taylor’s case on
  25 April. Since then, his challenges in detention have included the screws
  coming out of his prosthetic legs, causing him to fall and injure his hand,
  and being unable to obtain new, fitted prosthetic legs at a nearby clinic as a
  result of them being delivered without a charger for their battery. Then, once
  his fiancee brought a charger, a second appointment at the clinic two months
  later left him without results because the clinic was not familiar with
  Taylor’s model of prosthetics. The immigration detention system “can’t care
  for anybody beyond basic medical needs”, said Amy Zeidan, a professor of
  emergency medicine at Atlanta’s Emory University who has researched healthcare
  in the immigration detention system. The result: “mismanagement bordering on
  medical neglect” in cases like Taylor’s, she said. Meanwhile, Pierre has spent
  months “trying to figure out – who do I call? Who’s going to listen?” She has
  contacted Georgia’s senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, as well as
  non-profit organizations that advocate for people with disabilities and
  immigrants. “I am afraid for Rodney,” she wrote to Ossoff’s office on
  Saturday, after her fiancee had the run-in with guards. Warnock’s office said
  he couldn’t comment casework involving individuals. Ossoff said he couldn’t
  comment on an individual’s casework. On Sunday, the day after Taylor refused
  to enter his cell, guards handcuffed him and placed him in solitary
  confinement – until Tuesday, when Stewart’s assistant warden released him.
  During this time, he received no water to drink, and could not charge the
  battery in his prosthetic legs, Pierre said. Brian Todd, a spokesperson for
  CoreCivic, the company that owns Stewart, wrote in an email that Taylor “is
  being regularly monitored by facility medical staff, with all known medical
  issues are being addressed, and our staff continuing to accommodate his
  needs”. He also said that solitary confinement “does not exist” at Stewart,
  and that it uses “restrictive housing units”. Experts have said that
  conditions in CoreCivic’s RHUs are the same as solitary confinement. Taylor
  was brought to the US from Liberia by his mother on a medical visa when he was
  a small child. He went through 16 operations. He has two fingers on his right
  hand. Now 46, he has lived in the US nearly his entire life, works as a
  barber, is active in promoting cancer awareness in his community and got
  engaged only 10 days before Ice detained him in January. Despite having a
  pending application for US residence – commonly known as a “green card” – Ice
  detained and locked up Taylor in January due to a burglary conviction he
  received as a teenager and for which the state of Georgia pardoned him in
  2010, according to his attorney, who shared paperwork from his case with the
  Guardian. When he was detained, Taylor was only days away from being fitted
  for new prosthetics. Requests to Stewart to make an appointment for him to
  follow through on this appeared to be falling on deaf ears for four months.
  Then, after the Guardian’s story in April, Taylor received a visit from the
  warden. An appointment was made for late May. Pierre had gotten Taylor’s
  clinic in Lawrenceville, Georgia, to send the new prosthetics to a clinic in
  Albany, Georgia, about 75 miles from Stewart, in February. Nonetheless, when
  guards took him, shackled, to the rural clinic on 23 May, no one from Stewart
  or the clinic had ensured that the battery would be charged. Not only that,
  when he returned in late July, the clinic could not calibrate the legs to his
  body, since staff was unfamiliar with his model of prosthetics. Using the new
  prosthetics for months without them being calibrated means he suffers severe
  pain in his left knee, Taylor told the Guardian. Also in recent months, the
  Guardian’s and other reporting brought visits from Warnock’s staff and the
  Georgia Advocacy Office, part of a national network of congressionally
  authorized non-profit organizations defending the rights of people with
  disabilities. But when Warnock’s staff met with Taylor, the warden stood
  outside the door watching through a glass window, and cut the visit short
  after 15 minutes, Taylor said. “I only had time to answer two or three
  questions on a list,” he said. One thing that helps Taylor keep his spirits up
  is the relationships he’s made with fellow detainees. When he was in solitary
  confinement, several guards went to enter his cell, only to be blocked by a
  group of detainees. They said, ‘How could y’all do that to him? He’s a good
  guy,” according to Pierre. Meanwhile, despite the challenges, Taylor is trying
  his best to stay healthy, avoid any accidents and remain hopeful about his 12
  August hearing before an immigration judge, which may result in a decision on
  whether the US deports him. “I gotta make sure I can be able to walk when I
  get out of here,” he said. • This article was amended on 1 August 2025 to
  clarify it was not Rodney Taylor’s cell, but the area outside it that was
  flooded.
