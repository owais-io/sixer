  The first time I danced was with my father. I plucked my bare feet onto his
  work boots, to my mother’s distress, and let his rubber soles guide me into a
  groove. Hand in hand, we spun through the kitchen as Al Green’s Love and
  Happiness christened my rhythm’s baptism. The second time I danced was with
  myself – and it would be my last. I wrapped my arms around the fleshy part of
  my waist as Seal’s Kiss from a Rose played from the Batman Forever CD in my
  stereo. Alone in my room, I was OK with the mirror seeing every part of me. I
  danced like Shirley Temple with Buddy Ebsen. Like my father guided me. The
  only thing that could have broken my rhythm did. My stepmother filled the
  doorway, barefoot except for a roach she had stepped on. “Why are you so damn
  gay?” That question didn’t land as curiosity. It landed as a sentence – as
  instruction. From that moment on, joy had to pass inspection before it could
  be expressed. A decade later, in a different home and a different
  neighborhood, I stood over a sink, washing someone else’s blood off my hands –
  still shaking from having fought my way out of being jumped. I wasn’t just
  cleaning up. I was trying to scrub away any lingering doubt about my
  masculinity. This essay is about what happens when boys who move freely are
  taught to fear their own rhythm – and what it means when grown men like
  Karl-Anthony Towns are mocked for keeping theirs. Confusion, softness and the
  urge to question societal norms are beaten out of all of us – but especially
  out of young boys of color in dangerous neighborhoods. It’s as if the praxis
  of masculinity demands violence as the antidote to vulnerability. Even
  laughter had rules. You couldn’t let it be too high-pitched. Too quick. You
  learned to clap shoulders, not hold hands. I didn’t immediately reconcile my
  behavior with its double, but I spent my adolescence trying to prove my
  stepmom wrong. Since moving from Minnesota to New York, expectations for
  former No 1 draft pick Karl-Anthony Towns have increased on all fronts. In New
  York, the world’s largest media market, scrutiny moves faster than any
  headline – amplified by the virality of social media. Towns is discovering
  what happens when softness is punished, when queerness is projected, and when
  public figures become unwilling avatars in culture wars over masculinity. The
  term “zesty”, a softened descendant of homophobic slang, became Towns’ shadow.
  It trailed him through every three-point play, podcast outtake and postgame
  moment. He became the target for people eager to mock what they couldn’t
  define. In Hilton Als’s The Women, he recalls being called an “auntie man” – a
  Barbadian phrase for a queer man, used with equal parts derision and
  familiarity. For Als, the term was both burden and lens – a way to understand
  how femininity in male bodies disturbs cultural norms. Towns, in his gestures
  and tones, touched that nerve – not by coming out, but by refusing to contort
  himself into the rigid, humorless frame of what a man in sports is supposed to
  be. Towns is far from alone. Figures like Tyler, the Creator, Russell
  Westbrook and Odell Beckham Jr have also been queer-coded and mocked online –
  not for coming out, but for expressing aesthetic freedom that unsettles
  traditional expectations of Black masculinity. Reading Als, I realized I
  wasn’t just haunted by my stepmother’s question. I was haunted by the idea
  that my joy, softness and rhythm might be interpreted the same way – that to
  some, my way of moving through the world would always be “off”. Homophobia
  today isn’t what it was in the 1990s, when the idea of a gay NBA player
  sparked outrage. American culture has shifted. Most people – not just
  millennials – know someone who is openly gay. Even baby boomers often count
  LGBTQ+ individuals among their friends or family. This broader familiarity has
  normalized queerness – but mostly white, heteronormative queerness. During his
  presidency, Donald Trump welcomed “Gays for Trump”, revealing how sexuality
  has become more complicated in modern politics, so long as it’s white and
  votes red. But in sports, John Amaechi and Jason Collins remain punchlines.
  Dwight Howard was the most recent NBA player to be publicly dissected for his
  queer preferences. His situation involved layers of moral, legal and
  consensual complexity, but the cultural judgment echoed the same old
  anxieties. Towns is ostensibly straight. He’s in a public relationship with
  Jordyn Woods. But his moments of effeminacy have gone viral on TikTok,
  trickling down through Twitter and into Facebook echo chambers. Many cite his
  Dominican heritage – not as a direct link to queerness, but to the
  flamboyance, rhythm and emotional expressiveness embedded in that culture. And
  if he were gay or bi or queer, what exactly would that change? KAT is still a
  dawg. It’s ironic that this ridicule came during the best season of his
  career. He averaged 24.7 points and a career-high 13.5 rebounds while leading
  the Knicks to their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 25 years. He
  delivered signature performances, including back-to-back 40-point games and a
  playoff triple-double. His offensive dominance marked a personal and franchise
  turning point. But it wasn’t enough. The online ridicule intensified,
  crystallizing into what became known as “Zesty Karl-Anthony Towns”, or Zesty
  KAT – a meme that painted the Knicks star as flamboyant or queer-coded based
  on voice, gesture and posture. The term resurfaced in 2024 after viral TikTok
  compilations dissected clips from his postgame interviews and on-court
  expressions, reigniting during the 2025 playoffs. One of the most viral
  examples came from X user @Zazamyodor, who quote-tweeted a clip of Towns
  softly saying “for sure” with the caption, “That ‘for sure’ was nasty work.”
  The post earned over 46,000 likes and helped cement “zesty” as shorthand for
  mocking his style, despite his career peak. I still haven’t danced like I did
  that first time, or even the second. But I think about it often: what it meant
  to be light on my feet, unburdened, joyful without explanation. What
  Karl-Anthony Towns is enduring isn’t just a meme cycle. It’s the same sentence
  I heard in my doorway, repackaged for likes and algorithm reach: “Why are you
  so damn gay?” Not a question, an accusation. In this world, to be joyful in
  your body, to be expressive without apology, is still treated like defiance.
  Towns may not need to dance like I did. But every time he celebrates a
  three-pointer with flair, every time he speaks in a tone too tender for a
  seven-footer, he keeps the rhythm going for those of us who had ours
  interrupted.
