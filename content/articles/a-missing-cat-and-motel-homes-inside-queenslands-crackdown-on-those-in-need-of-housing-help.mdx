  of housing help

  When the occupants of a Morningside social housing unit in Brisbane were
  evicted on 7 July, the state’s housing department and police left one resident
  behind: Smokey, Paris Cumming’s cat. The jet black feline was left inside
  after the unit was locked and boarded up. Paris’s father, Craig Cumming, says
  he frantically contacted everyone from the RSPCA to housing officers and
  police but government departments “didn’t seem to be interested in the welfare
  of this animal”. Smokey was only discovered by chance 21 days later when a
  cleaning crew arrived. She had been hiding behind the stove. The eviction that
  led to Smokey’s disappearance is one of a growing number to have occurred amid
  a Queensland government crackdown on social housing tenants. Since last year’s
  change of government, the state has become a much tougher landlord. On 1 July
  the Liberal National government began implementing its “enhanced behaviour
  framework” for social housing. Residents can now be evicted and banned for two
  years after three infringements. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Karyn Walsh,
  the CEO of social welfare agency Micah Projects, says the three-strikes policy
  was even “harsher” than one implemented under the former LNP premier Campbell
  Newman. “It won’t reduce homelessness, it will increase it, and it will
  increase it for the most vulnerable,” she says. In July the state’s housing
  department issued 545 “antisocial behaviour notices”. The ultimate sanction
  has yet to be meted out but the department issued seven “first and final
  notices to leave”, according to evidence given at parliamentary estimates.
  Nearly 100 people have also been evicted from the state government’s
  “immediate housing response” (IHR) program, which books people in need of
  housing rooms in a motel or hotel. About 4,000 homeless Queenslanders live at
  one of 401 motels and hotels in rooms partly paid for through the IHR. The IHR
  is supposed to be the first step out of homelessness, with social housing a
  permanent escape. But since changes were implemented in March, recipients must
  meet new criteria, such as being eligible for social housing and having
  identification. Damaging a property makes you ineligible for return. The
  state’s housing minister, Sam O’Connor, said the changes were important to
  ensure “we prioritise housing support for those who are most in need in our
  community”. Among those who has been evicted is Ben Caines, who, for two
  months, had four walls for himself and his dog through the IHR at a Caloundra
  motel, on the Sunshine Coast. The accommodation wasn’t flashy. There were
  regular police raids, the air conditioning unit was held together with sticky
  tape and there was no kitchen but Caines didn’t make a fuss out of fear of
  losing it. But, just as he was getting back on his feet and on the cusp of
  overcoming homelessness, after finding a job as a disability support worker
  and an affordable rental he hoped to lease, he was told his time was up at the
  motel. Caines was banned from the IHR program for not applying for enough
  homes. He said he had nowhere to go after the eviction. The Queensland
  Department of Housing and Public Works was contacted for comment. Since
  Caines’ tenancy has been terminated, he is ineligible for IHR funding for six
  months. He is worried that he will end up in a tent in a park – and then lose
  the tent in a homeless clearance. “I am constantly under pressure,” he says.
  “I am always walking on eggshells. I never feel secure, which is a constant
  play on my mental health.” At last measure, 52,031 Queenslanders were on the
  social housing list, waiting for one of 77,000 dwellings to become available,
  according to the housing department. Most wait about two and a half years. As
  for Smokey the cat, she is yet to be reunited with her owners. “I miss Smokey
  so much … I want her back,” Paris Cumming says. A spokesperson for the
  Queensland police said the Morningside residents had been issued a written
  notice on 30 June. Removing possessions was the responsibility of the
  property’s owner, they said, and police had “not received any information
  relating to a cat at the residence”. The Department of Housing and Public
  Works did not answer a series of questions from Guardian Australia but
  responded with a general statement, saying housing help was “available for
  Queenslanders in genuine need”. “People who access housing assistance –
  whether short term or long term – are expected to be good tenants and
  neighbours,” a spokesperson said.
