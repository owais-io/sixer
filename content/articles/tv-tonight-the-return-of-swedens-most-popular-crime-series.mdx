  Beck 9pm, BBC Four Another gritty two-part case from what the BBC calls
  “Sweden’s most popular crime series”, based on the Martin Beck detective
  novels. This one starts with three armed young men pretending to be dropping
  off deliveries in order to break into a couple’s house – but was there more to
  this fatal robbery than meets the eye? Beck (Peter Haber), Alex (Jennie
  Silfverhjelm) and the team investigate. Hollie Richardson Our Farm Next Door:
  Amanda, Clive and Kids 6.30pm, Channel 4 It’s Christmas in Yorkshire! Or at
  least it is in this part of the Owen family’s barn renovation journey. Before
  gifting the goats with new coats and Boxing Day paddleboarding on the local
  tarn, there’s work to be done – including taking the scaffolding down and
  fitting doors. HR The Manhattan Project in Colour 8pm, Channel 4 This brisk
  film’s USP is colourising 80-year-old photos and footage from the Manhattan
  Project. Does it amount to much more than a gimmick? Not really. But it is an
  excellent showcase for the work of Ed Westcott, the photographer who recorded
  daily life at Los Alamos while the atomic bomb was being developed. Graeme
  Virtue The Count of Monte Cristo 9pm, U&amp;Drama The wig department went over
  budget for the second episode of this grand adaptation of the classic novel.
  Imprisoned Edmond Dantès (Sam Claflin, with a mane to rival Mufasa’s) meets
  inmate Abbé Faria (an equally bedraggled Jeremy Irons) – and the two hatch a
  plan to dig their way out. But five years later, Faria dies … HR Annika
  9.10pm, BBC One The excellent Nicola Walker elevates this serviceable but
  somewhat generic drama about a cop of Norwegian origin working for the
  Scottish Police Force’s maritime homicide unit. It’s a peculiar case for the
  team this time as they’re sent to Edinburgh after a recently released prisoner
  is pulled out of the river. But why is he in a dog cage? Phil Harrison
  Suspicion 11.50pm, ITV1 Who kidnapped Leo Newman? As the finale of this
  unremarkable thriller arrives, expect a few answers and a few surprises too.
  After a brief scuffle, Tara and friends evade the law and attempt to escape.
  But where does that leave Leo? Is he in mortal danger? Or, against all odds,
  is he exactly where he wants to be? PH Film choice Becoming Led Zeppelin, Sky
  Documentaries, on demand The archetypal origin story for a band is a bunch of
  schoolmates who pick up instruments and stumble on a hit sound. But, as
  Bernard MacMahon’s terrific, archive-stuffed documentary reveals, Led Zeppelin
  had a more roundabout gestation. Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul
  Jones were in-demand session players in 60s London, while singer Robert Plant
  and drummer John Bonham were jobbing musicians in Birmingham. It wasn’t until
  Page joined the Yardbirds that he realised his dream of a no-singles group
  with a heavy, improvisational edge. Featuring interviews with the surviving
  members, rare audio of Bonham and big chunks of gig footage, it’s a
  fascinating slice of rock history. Simon Wardell The Pickup, out now, Prime
  Video Russell (Eddie Murphy) is an armoured truck guard edging towards
  retirement who is paired with irritating newbie Travis (Pete Davidson) on a
  long day of deliveries. However, their van is targeted by criminals led by
  Keke Palmer’s Zoe, forcing a change of plans for all involved. Oddly, Tim
  Story’s chase caper turned heist thriller makes Murphy the straight man to
  Davidson’s goofball, at the expense of the star’s comic abilities. But the
  confident, charismatic Palmer takes up some of the slack, and the highway
  action sequences are smartly done. SW Back to the Future Part III, 3.35pm, BBC
  One Shot back to back with Part II, the final part of the sci-fi trilogy is a
  much better film, largely due to the fun everyone seems to be having with the
  western setting. Dusting off the DeLorean, Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) flies
  back to 1885 to save Christopher Lloyd’s stranded Doc Brown from being shot
  dead by Buford Tannen, Biff’s ancestor. Playful tweaks to the genre and a
  romance for Doc with Mary Steenburgen’s teacher are the new elements in an
  otherwise familiar plot of cobbled-together gadgetry, space-time dilemmas and
  jolly slapstick comedy. SW Margrete: Queen of the North, 1.05am, BBC Two
  Charlotte Sieling’s 2021 historical drama takes a footnote from the life of a
  14th-century Danish royal and gives it a dusting of Game of Thrones-style clan
  politics, generational scheming and nation building. The estimable Trine
  Dyrholm is magnetic as Margrete, who – despite being a woman in a man’s world
  – has unified Norway, Sweden and Denmark and presides over a time of peace.
  Then a man appears claiming to be her long-dead son, which puts her adopted
  heir Erik (Morten Hee Andersen) in a funk and threatens to destabilise her
  hard-won pact. SW Live sport Championship Football: Southampton v Wrexham,
  11am, Sky Sports Main Event Followed by Sheffield Utd v Bristol City at
  5.15pm. Leicester v Sheffield Wednesday is on Sunday at 3.30pm. Athletics:
  T100 Triathlon World Tour, 11.45am, TNT Sports 2 The first day of the fourth
  round at the Royal Victoria Docks, London. Racing: Ascot, 1pm, ITV1 Includes
  the Shergar Cup, where 12 of the top riders from around the world compete in a
  team event. The Hundred Cricket: Oval Invincibles Men v Manchester Originals
  Men, 2.45pm, Sky Sports Main Event Welsh Fire men v London Spirit men is on
  BBC Two at 5.45pm.
