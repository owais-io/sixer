  Emmanuel Macron has given his “full support” to France’s beleaguered prime
  minister, François Bayrou, who is expected to lose a confidence vote next
  month, which would be likely to cause the government to collapse. Macron
  chaired a cabinet meeting on Wednesday as France faces a fresh political
  crisis. The government spokesperson, Sophie Primas, said after the meeting
  that Macron fully supported Bayrou and the government was in a “fighting
  spirit”. Bayrou, a centrist and Macron ally, announced this week he would call
  a confidence vote for 8 September, seeking parliament’s support for his
  austerity measures to cut public spending and reduce public debt. Opposition
  parties have said they will vote to oust Bayrou, who polls show is the least
  popular prime minister since 1958. Bayrou’s proposals for a €44bn budget
  squeeze, which include scrapping two public holidays and freezing most welfare
  spending, are widely unpopular. Primas said Macron believed there should be
  neither “denial nor catastrophising” about the state of France’s public
  finances and that opposition parties must show “responsibility”. She said the
  government’s budget proposals were necessary. “France is a solid country with
  solid economics … but we must take the reins of our destiny,” Primas said.
  Describing Macron’s remarks to cabinet, she said: “It’s a strong signal that
  we are sending to the financial markets that we want to have a France that is
  even more solid.” Macron is still dealing with the fallout from a political
  crisis that began last summer when he called a surprise snap election that
  resulted in a deadlocked parliament with no absolute majority. Since then, the
  national assembly has been split between the left, the far right and the
  centre. Michel Barnier, the rightwing prime minister chosen by Macron last
  September to try to bring together the fragmented parliament, was ousted after
  only three months in office when his budget plans were rejected and the
  government was toppled. Bayrou followed Barnier and he will have been in
  office for only nine months if the government is toppled once again. Even if
  Macron replaces him swiftly, it is not certain that a new appointee would be
  able to secure consensus on a budget for next year in the bitterly divided
  parliament. Calls were growing on Wednesday for Macron to call another snap
  parliamentary election less than 18 months after the last. Marine Le Pen’s
  far-right National Rally favours a new election as it hopes it can gain seats.
  A large majority of French people want parliament dissolved for another
  election, according to polls by Ifop, Elabe and Toluna Harris Interactive.
  Macron said earlier this month that he wanted to avoid dissolving parliament
  again but he has also suggested he could not rule out the option. Macron’s
  former prime minister Édouard Philippe, who now heads the centre-right
  Horizons party, said that if a stalemate persisted and no other government
  could come up with a budget, an election seemed inevitable. Gabriel Attal,
  another former prime minister and the head of Macron’s centrist Renaissance
  party, said he did not think a new election would necessarily bring stability
  or clarity. Bayrou warned that France’s debt is unsustainable, particularly as
  interest rate rises push up the cost of borrowing. After years of
  overspending, France is on notice to control its public deficit and cut its
  debt, as required under EU rules. All political parties agree that public debt
  is an issue but they disagree on how to tackle it.
