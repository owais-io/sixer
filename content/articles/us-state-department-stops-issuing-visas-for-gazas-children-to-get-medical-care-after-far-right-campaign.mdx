  The US state department announced on Saturday that it would stop issuing visas
  to children from Gaza in desperate need of medical care after an online
  pressure campaign from Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer close to Donald
  Trump who has described herself as “a proud Islamophobe”. “All visitor visas
  for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and
  thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of
  temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days,” the state department
  said in a message posted on X, the social media platform formerly known as
  Twitter, from which Loomer was banned before it was purchased by Elon Musk. In
  a pair of posts on the social network on Friday, Loomer had shared video of
  badly injured Palestinian children and their family members arriving in
  Houston and San Francisco this month, along with false claims that their
  shouts of joy were “jihadi chants” and that they were “doing the HAMAS terror
  whistle”. Loomer also falsely claimed that she had “exclusively obtained” the
  two video clips she shared. One was copied from a medical aid charity’s public
  Instagram account and the other was from the Houston Chronicle’s YouTube
  channel. After misrepresenting the children, including amputees arriving to
  get prosthetic legs, as “Islamic invaders from an Islamic terror hot zone”,
  Loomer demanded to know “who at the US State Department under @marcorubio
  signed off on the visas for Palestinians from a HAMAS hot zone”. “Is Rubio
  even aware of this?” Loomer wrote, in reference to the secretary of state who
  was at the time in Alaska meeting Vladimir Putin. “Why would anyone at the
  State Department give visas to individuals who live in Gaza, which is run by
  HAMAS?” Loomer wrote, before falsely stating that “95% of GAZANS voted for
  HAMAS.” In fact, Hamas got 44% of party list votes in the 2006 Palestinian
  legislative elections across Gaza and the West Bank, and lost three of the
  five districts in Gaza to the secular Fatah party. There has been no election
  since then. After the visa program was halted, Loomer declared victory. “This
  is fantastic news,” she wrote in response to the state department
  announcement. “Hopefully all GAZANS will be added to President Trump’s travel
  ban. There are doctors in other countries. The US is not the world’s
  hospital!” Republican Congressman Randy Fine explicitly commended Loomer after
  the visa change was announced, in a sign of her sway over some US policy.
  “Massive credit needs to be given to @LauraLoomer for uncovering this and
  making me and other officials aware. Well done, Laura,” Fine wrote on X. The
  Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, a US-based charity, called on the Trump
  administration to “reverse this dangerous and inhumane decision.” Over the
  last 30 years the charity has evacuated thousands of Palestinian children to
  the US for medical care, it said in a statement. “Medical evacuations are a
  lifeline for the children of Gaza who would otherwise face unimaginable
  suffering or death due to the collapse of medical infrastructure in Gaza.” The
  Council on Islamic-American Relations said the block on visas was “the latest
  sign that the intentional cruelty of President Trump’s ‘Israel First’
  administration knows no bounds” and added that it was “deeply ironic” that the
  Trump administration was meanwhile “rolling out the red carpet for racists and
  indicted war criminals from the Israeli government.” “This ban is just the
  latest example of our government’s complicity with Israel’s genocide, which is
  increasingly rejected by the American people,” it continued. Paul Graham,
  co-founder of the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote on X
  after the visa halt was announced: “If Laura Loomer had been around in 1940,
  she’d have been trying to prevent Jewish refugees from entering the US. You
  know she would. And if Trump had been president then, she’d have succeeded.”
