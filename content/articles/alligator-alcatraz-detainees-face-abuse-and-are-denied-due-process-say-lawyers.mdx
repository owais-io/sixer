  A federal judge in Miami was hearing arguments on Monday that detainees at the
  remote immigration jail in the Florida Everglades known as “Alligator
  Alcatraz” are routinely subjected to human rights abuses and denied due
  process before being deported. The lawsuit, filed by the American Civil
  Liberties Union (ACLU), is one of two separate actions before the courts that
  could lead to the closure of the controversial facility celebrated by Donald
  Trump for its harsh conditions. District court judge Kathleen Williams is
  expected to rule this week in the other case, brought by an alliance of
  environmental groups and a Native American tribe, claiming that the
  immigration jail has inflicted irreversible damage to the fragile wetlands.
  Earlier this month, Williams issued a temporary restraining order against the
  state of Florida halting new construction and expansion of the tented camp,
  although its operations for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency
  (Ice) were allowed to continue. The jail currently holds an estimated 700
  detainees. Monday’s hearing, before district court judge Rodolfo Ruiz in the
  same downtown Miami courthouse, was focused on alleged breaches of immigrants’
  rights during their detention. Eunice Cho, an attorney for the ACLU, told
  reporters at a pre-hearing press conference on Thursday that the situation at
  “Alligator Alcatraz” was “anomalous from what is typically granted at other
  immigration facilities”. She expanded on the allegation during an interview on
  Sunday with the Miami news channel Local 10, claiming the government was
  “running roughshod” over detainees’ constitutionally mandated protections. “We
  are hearing stories of officers who are going around the facility pressuring
  people to sign voluntary removal orders without being able to speak to
  counsel,” Cho said. “We heard a case of an intellectually disabled man being
  presented with a paper … he was told that he should sign the paper to get a
  blanket, and it turned out to be a voluntary departure form. And he was
  deported very soon after.” Cho also challenged assertions by Florida’s
  Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, and the state’s department of emergency
  management (DEM) that operates the facility for Ice, that all the detainees
  held there had broken the law, and had either criminal records or active
  criminal proceedings against them. “What is very clear is that the people who
  are being held at Alligator Alcatraz are far from the picture of what the
  government has been trying to paint them as,” she said. “There are people who
  have no criminal history whatsoever, people who have been living in the United
  States and Florida for decades, have had the same job for over 20 years, have
  five children and families here.” She said the ACLU had spoken with attorneys
  for some of the detainees who submitted sworn testimony to the court alleging
  the abuses. They include immigrants being held in cages in extreme heat,
  swarms of mosquitoes, backed up or non-functioning toilets, and temperamental
  air conditioning units that leave temperatures alternately freezing or
  sweltering. An attorney for one detainee said last week he believed a
  respiratory virus, possibly Covid-19, was “running rampant” through the
  facility. The Florida DEM has not responded to several requests by the
  Guardian for comment. The ACLU is asking Ruiz to order closure of the jail,
  which was hastily constructed on a disused airstrip with disaster relief funds
  and opened early in July. Democrats who toured the facility decried what they
  said were inhumane conditions inside, and cited cases where non-criminals and
  even a US citizen child was taken there. Lawyers for the defendants, the
  justice department and the state of Florida, have argued that the Miami court
  has no jurisdiction over the camp because it is located in neighboring Collier
  county, and the case should be held in Florida’s middle district instead. Ruiz
  has indicated he will rule on a venue after Monday’s hearing, and indicated at
  a pre-trial hearing last week that he believed at least some of the arguments
  might pertain to the adjacent district. DeSantis announced on Thursday that
  the state was beginning construction on a new federal immigration jail for an
  additional 1,300 detainees at the closed Baker correctional institute in
  northern Florida. The governor nicknamed that facility “the deportation
  depot”. Protests outside Alligator Alcatraz, meanwhile, continue to grow.
  Noelle Damico, director of social justice at the Workers Circle, said almost
  300 people attended a rally on Sunday afternoon, and that protests would
  continue every weekend until the camp was closed permanently.
