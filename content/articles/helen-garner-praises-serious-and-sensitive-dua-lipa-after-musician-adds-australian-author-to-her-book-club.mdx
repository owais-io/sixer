  Helen Garner has praised Dua Lipa as a “serious and sensitive” interviewer
  after the British superstar added Garner’s nonfiction book This House of Grief
  to her monthly book club. Garner’s 2014 courtroom drama will be the first
  Australian inclusion on the popular list, taking the Melbourne author’s work
  to the singer’s growing global audience. Lipa said Garner’s book offered a
  “sharp and forensic analysis of the human condition,” announcing the selection
  in an Instagram post. “Although Helen has been writing for almost 50 years,
  her work is new to me and it’s a thrilling discovery,” Lipa wrote. “She’s one
  of the most fascinating writers I have come across in recent years, and I’m
  sure that, like me, you’ll find yourself diving into her back catalogue.”
  Garner will join 23 high-profile authors championed by Lipa after the August
  publication of the interview, which the author described as “fruitful”. “I
  found her an impressive person, serious and sensitive and deeply interested in
  the difficult questions that the book raises,” Garner said. Lipa foreshadowed
  Garner’s addition ahead of her interview series’ move to streaming on Spotify
  in June. “It wouldn’t be my book pile without at least one harrowing story,”
  Lipa said at the time. Garner won international acclaim for This House of
  Grief, a retelling of the trial of Victorian man Robert Farquharson over the
  murder of his three sons. Farquharson drove his three children into a dam in
  south-western Victoria in 2005. The book received special mention in Garner’s
  2016 win of the US$150,000 (A$207,633) Windham Campbell literary prize. The
  author first thought the award was hoax after an email in her junk folder from
  someone at Yale University who had “good news” and wanted her phone number,
  she said at the time. Garner, 82, came to local prominence after the 1977
  publication of Monkey Grip but has enjoyed soaring popularity outside
  Australia in the last decade. New editions of several of Garner’s books,
  including This House of Grief, were republished in the UK and US in 2023 and
  2024. Lipa shared a preview of her analysis announcing This House of Grief’s
  selection on Instagram. “[Garner’s] not looking for monsters – her interest
  lies with ordinary people who seem to have been pushed beyond their emotional
  limits,” Lipa wrote. “As the trial progresses, I found myself questioning my
  own reactions, asking myself less, Did he do it? and instead, Is it possible
  to have empathy for this man, even if he did the worst thing imaginable?” The
  29-year-old singer has attracted more than 450,000 Instagram followers and
  nearly 100,000 YouTube subscriptions to her Service95 platform, which launched
  monthly book club picks in 2023. Authors of each of Lipa’s monthly book picks
  have sat for extended interviews with the singer, analysing their work and
  sharing music recommendations. The lone exception is Gabriel García Márquez,
  author of 1967’s One Hundred Years of Solitude, who died in 2014. Garner’s is
  the 24th book to be included and the first by an Australian author, in a list
  dominated by American books but spanning Patrick Radden Keefe’s Say Nothing to
  Guadalupe Nettel’s Still Born. Lipa has previously singled out Albanian author
  Ismail Kadare as a personal inspiration, saying the novelist’s work encouraged
  her connection with her Kosovan-Albanian heritage in a keynote speech for the
  Booker prize 2022 ceremony. “I often wonder if authors realise just how many
  gifts they give us,” she said. This House of Grief by Helen Garner (Orion
  Publishing Co, £9.99). To support the Guardian, order your copy at
