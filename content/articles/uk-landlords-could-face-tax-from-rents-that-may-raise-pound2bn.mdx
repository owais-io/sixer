  The Treasury is reportedly considering a tax on landlords that will target
  income from rents in the upcoming autumn budget. The proposals are centred on
  the expansion of national insurance to include rental income, which is
  currently exempt from the levy, as part of a broader push to plug a potential
  £40bn shortfall in the public finances. Labour insiders told the Times that
  property income was “a significant potential extra source of funds” and
  landlords were seen as a way of targeting “unearned revenue”. Currently,
  earnings from property, savings and pensions are largely exempt from national
  insurance. However, widening national insurance, which usually applied
  employee earnings at a rate of 8%, to include rental income could reportedly
  end up raising about £2bn. Earlier this month a Guardian analysis revealed
  four cabinet ministers, including the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, had declared
  rental income from property in the MPs’ register of interests. One in eight
  Westminster MPs declared a rental income from property in the past year,
  including 43 Labour MPs, 27 Conservative MPs and seven Liberal Democrat MPs.
  Estate agents are already warning that speculation around potential property
  taxes in Reeves’s autumn budget could dampen demand and hit the
  price-sensitive housing market. The property website Zoopla said the
  speculation around property taxes “may make some buyers consider a
  wait-and-see strategy. This covers those who may possibly save money on
  purchases under £500,000 and concern those buying over this level as well.”
  The Guardian revealed earlier this month that Reeves is considering a tax on
  the sale of homes over £500,000. Officials have been examining a potential
  national property tax, which would replace stamp duty on owner-occupied homes.
  They have been studying whether, after the national tax, a local property tax
  could then replace council tax in the medium-term in an effort to repair
  battered local authority finances. Reeves is also reportedly weighing up the
  removal of the capital gains tax exemption on primary residences above £1.5m
  as ways to boost income for the government. The education minister Stephen
  Morgan told Times Radio and Sky News he was unable to comment on speculation
  but that he wanted the upcoming budget to be rooted in “Labour values”. He
  told Times Radio: “Obviously taxation policies are a matter for the chancellor
  of the exchequer, and she will set out more detail in the budget later this
  year. “I want to make sure that our budget is based on our Labour values, and
  that is what Rachel Reeves will deliver. It’s not for me to comment on
  speculation. Our focus is on driving growth in the economy and delivering for
  working people up and down the country.” Speaking later to Sky News, Morgan
  said: “We’re focused on growing the economy. Fixing the foundations of the
  country, restoring public service and that decade of national renewal. I’m
  afraid you will have to wait until the budget later this year.” A Treasury
  spokesperson did not directly comment on speculation around the landlords tax
  but said in a statement: “The best way to strengthen public finances is by
  growing the economy – which is our focus. Changes to tax and spend policy are
  not the only ways of doing this, as seen with our planning reforms, which are
  expected to grow the economy by £6.8bn and cut borrowing by £3.4bn. “We are
  committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why
  at last autumn’s budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our
  promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax,
  employee national insurance, or VAT.”
