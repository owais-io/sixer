  As Labor Day rallies took place across the US, the Chicago mayor Brandon
  Johnson sharply denounced the Trump administration’s threat to deploy federal
  troops to the city as part of an immigration crackdown. “No federal troops in
  the city of Chicago,” said Johnson on Monday to a gathered crowd at the
  “Workers over Billionaires” demonstration in Chicago’s West Loop neighborhood.
  Johnson added: “We’re going to defend our democracy … we’re going to protect
  the humanity of every single person in the city of Chicago.” Johnson later led
  the crowd in chants of “No troops in Chicago” and “Invest in Chicago”, the New
  York Times reported. Protesters also met outside the Trump Tower in the city’s
  River North neighborhood, carrying anti-Trump posters and chanting “Lock him
  up”, according to footage posted to social media. Monday’s rally in Chicago
  was one of hundreds of protests organized across the country as part of the
  national “Workers Over Billionaires” effort, a mass action calling for the
  protection of social safety nets such as Social Security; the funding of
  public schools, healthcare, and housing; amid other demands. “Together we will
  demand a country that puts workers over billionaires,” said the May Day Strong
  group, a coalition to labor unions, in a statement about the event.
  Demonstrations took place in cities large and small, including New York,
  Houston, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. Smaller cities such as Cleveland,
  Ohio and Greensboro, North Carolina, held rallies of their own as a part of
  the nationwide action. The May Day Strong group, a coalition to labor unions,
  organized Monday’s efforts, along with AFL-CIO, the US’s largest federation of
  unions; the One Fair Wage, a non-profit advocating for fair wages for
  restaurant workers; and other labor groups. “This is about organic, grassroots
  organizing, and we intentionally wanted it to be outside of Washington DC,
  because that’s where the impacts are being felt,” said Liz Shuler, president
  of the AFL-CIO, about Monday’s efforts. In New York, hundreds gathered across
  the street from Trump Tower in the city’s Midtown district, USA Today
  reported. Separate protests were held throughout New York state, including in
  Albany, the state’s capital. US senator Kirsten Gillibrand, who represents New
  York, made an appearance at an Albany demonstration. “It’s Labor Day [and] we
  want to celebrate working men and people in this community,” said Gilibrand.
  New York state, the middle class was built on the labor movement and it’s time
  to recognize how important working people are to this community, to our
  country, to our great state,” she added. Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 residents in
  DC joined a protest against Trump’s federal takeover of the city, reported
  WUSA9. Participants of the event, dubbed the “Freedom Run”, ran and walked
  through DC while chanting. Christie Harlan, who took part in Monday’s run,
  shared her motivations for joining with WUSA9. “I feel bad for the families of
  the national guard members who’ve been deployed here to essentially be window
  dressing for this administration,” said Harlan. The Trump administration’s
  termination of federal employees, many who worked out of the DC area, also
  prompted others to take part in the run. “Firing folks left and right, some of
  the damage that’s being done is going to be irreparable whenever things come
  back,” said participant Janice Ferebee to WUSA9. Thousands also marched in the
  Los Angeles area early Monday, local affiliate KTLA reported. The rally was
  followed by a free picnic for community members, along with live
  entertainment. Several protests were organized in California’s Bay Area.
  Residents in Redwood City, about an hour from San Francisco, even formed a
  17-mile human chain to Santa Clara as apart of the day’s protest, NBC Bay Area
  reported. Alongside the coordinated protests, workers at the Hilton
  Americas-Houston, one of Houston’s largest hotels, walked off the job as apart
  of a nine-day strike, the Houston Chronicle reported. The walkout came as
  Hilton failed to reach a deal with members of the Unite Here Local 23 Texas
  chapter, which includes the more than 400 workers at the hotel. Among several
  demands, workers are campaigning for a higher minimum wage of $23-per-hour, up
  from the current rate of $16.50. The strike, which is set to end 10 September,
  is the first in the union’s 25-year history, chapter president Franchesca
  Caraballo told the Chronicle. As thousands took part in the rallies, Trump
  posted his own Labor Day message to the Truth Social platform: a photo of
  himself shaking hands with workers. The image featured the caption:
  “Celebrating 250 years of THE AMERICAN WORKER. Happy Labor Day.”
