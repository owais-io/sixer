  Several protesters outside New York City’s 26 Federal Plaza government
  building were arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct, with demonstrators
  accusing the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency of operating
  a covert detention facility there, according to several reports. Protesters
  marched to the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan on Friday
  morning and chanted outside the building. Demonstrators demanded access to the
  site, which was denied, and they later held a sit-in outside the courthouse,
  according to Hunter Dunn, the press coordinator for the grassroots protest
  movement known as 50501. Within a few minutes the New York City police
  department moved in to arrest about 15 protesters for disorderly conduct,
  according to Dunn, as activists could be seen blocking the street. “No fear,
  no hate, no Ice in our state!” chanted demonstrators during their march to the
  site, where Ice agents routinely detain immigrants after immigration court
  proceedings, in a move that goes against previously normal practice. “They
  were entirely peaceful,” Dunn told the Guardian. “It is not wrong to
  demonstrate against illegal, unconstitutional and immoral actions by the
  federal government.” Demonstrators allege detainees are being held in
  overcrowded conditions without many basic amenities or legal access at 26
  Federal Plaza’s 10th floor, where the agency denies it detains people, and are
  demanding unrestricted access for elected officials, journalists and faith
  leaders. Friday’s protest was one of several in the city this week. Last
  month, footage from inside 26 Federal Plaza shared by the New York Immigration
  Coalition (NYIC) showed two dozen men in bare rooms, some lying on the floor
  with emergency blankets and with few basic provisions. “Just to be a presence,
  we’re here to say that the American people are opposed to these kinds of
  policies. And for Ice agents, maybe that will lead some of them to reconsider
  their career choice,” Jeffrey Courter, the chair of the justice ministries
  committee of the Presbytery of New York City, told ABC7. Authorities insist
  the facility is only a processing center. Lawmakers have been denied access to
  the site. In June, Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller, was arrested while
  escorting an immigrant from a hearing. Several groups, including 50501 and
  NYIC, as well as faith-based groups, were present at the protest. Courthouse
  detentions have become a flashpoint in the Trump administration’s aggressive
  immigration crackdown, which aims to arrest 3,000 people daily. Reports from
  cities including Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago and El Paso, Texas, describe
  routine court appearances devolving into tense encounters. A newly filed
  class-action lawsuit seeks to ban the practice of making Ice arrests at
  immigration courthouses.
