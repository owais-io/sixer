  Five people have been arrested at a protest in London where a group of masked
  men attempted to enter a hotel housing asylum seekers on Saturday. At about
  noon, two anti-asylum groups marched to the Crowne Plaza in Stockley Road,
  west London, and a group of men in masks attempted to enter the building
  through the rear entrance and damaged security fences, the Metropolitan police
  said. Other demonstrators moved towards the nearby Novotel on Cherry Lane, in
  West Drayton, and a Holiday Inn. Officers enforced cordons in the area to
  prevent a breach of the peace and three arrests were made. Two officers
  suffered minor injuries and two more arrests were made as officers dispersed
  the crowd, the force added. A section 35 dispersal order has been put in
  place, allowing officers to direct people to leave the area and not return if
  they suspect they may cause disorder, police said. Cmdr Adam Slonecki, in
  charge of policing London this weekend, said: “Around 500 protesters were in
  the area, but most people have now dispersed from the immediate vicinity.
  However, further arrests will be made if we need to tackle disorder.” In
  Essex, police have put in place a section 60AA order giving the force the
  power to order the removal of face coverings and a dispersal order before a
  planned protest in Epping on Saturday evening. The section 60AA order will run
  for 24 hours and the dispersal order, which covers the main high street and
  the area surrounding the Bell hotel, will be in place until 4am on Sunday.
  Glen Pavelin, an assistant chief constable with Essex police, said: “We never
  take the decision to impose restrictions on members of the public lightly.
  “However, we must guard against the impact of antisocial behaviour on our
  community and these orders will give us extra powers to deal with that should
  it become necessary to do so.” The prime minister, Keir Starmer, wrote on X:
  “I am clear: we will not reward illegal entry. If you cross the Channel
  unlawfully, you will be detained and sent back.” In Falkirk, activists who
  descended on a hotel were met by hundreds of counter-protesters. Two separate
  demonstrations were called by the Save Our Future and Our Kids Futures group
  in the town on Saturday over concerns about alleged crimes linked to those
  housed at the Cladhan hotel. Hundreds gather outside the office of the local
  Scottish Labour MP, Euan Stainbank. More than 200 people later assembled
  outside the nearby Cladhan hotel, which is believed to house asylum seekers
  waiting for their claims to be processed. Stainbank said: “We must fix the
  broken asylum system which has not worked for years – for communities such as
  Falkirk, and for those seeking refuge from persecution. “The Labour
  government’s actions, within days of entering office, to end the Tories’
  Rwanda scheme, focus resources on processing claims and ending needless
  processing pauses will allow us to close all the Tory-created asylum hotels
  during this parliament.” The protest is the second in as many weeks outside
  the Cladhan hotel. Another demonstration took place outside a facility in
  Perth last week.
