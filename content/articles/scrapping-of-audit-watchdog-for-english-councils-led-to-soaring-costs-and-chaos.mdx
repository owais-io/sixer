  David Cameron’s “bonfire of the quangos” decision to abolish England’s council
  spending watchdog has left a broken system that is costing taxpayers more
  money than it was promised to save. In a highly critical report, academics at
  the University of Sheffield said the coalition government of the Conservatives
  and Liberal Democrats had promised savings of £100m a year by abolishing the
  Audit Commission. However, replacing the public body with a private-sector
  model had resulted in “chaos” and soaring costs to audit councils amid the
  financial crisis hitting England’s town halls. Several councils have declared
  effective bankruptcy linked to years of austerity, soaring costs amid pressure
  on services, as well as local missteps. They include Birmingham, Nottingham
  and Woking. The Audit Reform Lab at Sheffield said the average cost of
  external auditors checking a local authority’s finances was now at least
  £50,000 higher in cash terms than when the Audit Commission was disbanded in
  2015. Private-sector accountancy firms took over the job of auditing local
  government accounts in England after the agency was abolished, in an
  austerity-driven push by Tory and Lib Dem ministers to find savings and
  efficiencies. “Ten years on, however, it now seems clear that these reform
  ambitions have failed,” the authors of the report wrote. “Only 1% of audits
  were delivered on time in 2022-23, with many audits delayed by several years.
  Audit costs have risen dramatically in response. An unwieldy, but ultimately
  operational centralised bureaucracy was replaced by market chaos. The £100m
  per annum savings heralded by the UK government in 2014 are now a distant
  memory.” The report found that average audit costs in England had more than
  tripled – an average increase of 238% – in the year to 2023-24. It blamed most
  of this increase on private-sector auditors hiking their rates. It compared
  the large rise in audit costs in England to much smaller increases in Scotland
  and Wales, where it said there was a much stronger level of central oversight
  of private-sector auditing. Some of the biggest increases were at financially
  stricken councils, including a 620% rise in audit fees at Woking, as well as
  leaps of 470% at Runnymede and 450% at Spelthorne. In total 13 councils had
  fee scale increases of 300% or more in 2022-23. Birmingham city council paid
  an audit fee above the £1m mark, representing a 314% increase. The councils
  were approached for comment. Three auditors dominate the local audit market:
  EY, Grant Thornton and Forvis Mazars. Others including Deloitte and BDO have
  exited because profit margins are considered too low, while complexity and
  risks have risen. EY and Grant Thornton declined to comment. A spokesperson
  for Forvis Mazars said: “We are working closely with all stakeholders
  including MHCLG [Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government] and
  remain committed to supporting the return to the delivery of good quality
  audits for local authorities.” While audit costs have risen sharply, so has
  the complexity of checking council finances at a time when growing numbers of
  local authorities are running into severe financial difficulties. Experts have
  also long warned local audit fees have been too low to attract accountancy
  firms to do the job, compared with the money available in private-sector
  auditing. In 2020, an independent review by Sir Tony Redmond found fees were
  “at least 25% lower than required to fulfil current local audit requirements
  effectively”. The breakdown in local audit reached crisis point two years ago
  when only 1% of English councils had their 2022-23 accounts signed off in
  time. Ministers then allowed accounts to be completed with qualifications –
  whereby an auditor signs off but expresses reservations – to clear the
  backlog. A new Local Audit Office is also being established to centralise
  previously fragmented oversight of the process. An MHCLG spokesperson said:
  “We have taken decisive action to restore the broken audit system, providing
  £49m to help councils clear backlogs – but we know there is more to do. This
  is why we will set up a new Local Audit Office to simplify the system and
  increase capacity by establishing public sector audit provision. “This will
  ensure the local audit system provides accountability, transparency, and value
  for money for taxpayers.” Runnymede council said it was on a sound financial
  footing and did not recognise the fees quoted in the Audit Reform Lab report.
