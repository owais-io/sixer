  Theatre Small Acts of Love This musical drama tackles the aftermath of the
  Lockerbie bombing in 1988, bringing to life the friendships forged between
  locals from the Scottish borders and the American relatives of those on Pan AM
  flight 103. Co-produced with the National Theatre of Scotland, and the
  inaugural show for the reopening of the Citizens theatre’s redeveloped
  building, it includes 14 actor-singers and a five-piece roots band. Could this
  be the new Come from Away? • Citizens theatre, Glasgow, 9 September-4 October
  Bacchae “This ain’t no classic play b*tches.” So reads the advertising tagline
  to this part spoken-word reimagining of Euripides’s orgiastic ancient drama
  about a group of women who tear a king to bits. Written by Nima Taleghani, it
  is the first playwright’s debut to be performed on the Olivier stage and is
  helmed by Indhu Rubasingham, the National Theatre’s new director. • National
  Theatre, London, 13 September-1 November Mary Page Marlowe Susan Sarandon is
  the latest American A-lister to make her way to Britain’s boards. She is one
  of Hollywood’s most respected actors, so this promises to be quite an event.
  Tracy Letts’s 2016 family drama focuses on a mother and daughter relationship
  across the decades, with Andrea Riseborough starring opposite Sarandon. • Old
  Vic, London, 23 September-1 November Cyrano de Bergerac Adrian Lester has
  excelled in a spate of Shakespearean roles on stage. Now he takes on the large
  proboscis-ed poet, soldier and letter-writing lover from Edmond Rostand’s
  19th-century classic. What makes the Royal Shakespeare Company’s production
  all the more of an exciting prospect is that it is co-adapted by grime poet
  and playwright Debris Stevenson along with screen and stage director Simon
  Evans. • Swan theatre, Stratford-Upon-Avon, 27 September-15 November Rohtko
  Polish auteur Łukasz Twarkowski is known for his monumental, multimedia shows.
  He made a splash in London with The Employees, about life in space, earlier
  this year. This drama, based on a real-life scandal of forgeries of Mark
  Rothko paintings, promises to have the same pumping techno beats and
  high-octane visual aesthetics. Prepare for your eyes to pop. • Barbican,
  London, 2-5 October Small Hotel Ralph Fiennes and Francesca Annis give this
  new drama by Rebecca Lenkiewicz its celebrity stardust. Once a real-life
  couple, they play family members here, with Fiennes as a troubled TV star and
  Annis as his domineering mother. Directed by Holly Race Roughan, from touring
  company Headlong, it is the last in a Fiennes season at the venue. • Theatre
  Royal Bath, 3-18 October The Maids Kip Williams was the experimental
  Australian director behind a multiscreen, one-woman adaptation of The Picture
  of Dorian Gray starring Sarah Snook (who won an Olivier award for playing 26
  roles in it). This adaptation of Jean Genet’s 1947 play featuring a pair of
  sadomasochistic sisters is its follow-up, translated, adapted and directed by
  Williams. Expectations are high. • Donmar Warehouse, London, 13 October-29
  November The Fight Based on a true story, this Theatr na nÓg production
  dramatises the life of Merthyr-born Cuthbert Taylor, who was partly of
  Caribbean heritage; he represented Britain at the Olympics in 1928 but was
  denied the opportunity to compete for a British title because of a colour bar
  enforced by the nation’s sporting body, which deemed him “not white enough to
  be British”. • Sherman theatre, Cardiff, 16-22 October Paddington: The Musical
  If the immersive Paddington Bear Experience at London’s County Hall is not
  enough and you are itching for more adventures after the third film, this
  musical about the Peruvian bear might help fill your marmalade-sandwich-shaped
  hole. Adapted from the Michael Bond book and the films, it features music
  composed by Tom Fletcher. • Savoy theatre, London, 1 November 2025-25 May 2026
  All My Sons This revival of Arthur Miller’s play comes stuffed with talent,
  from Paapa Essiedu and Marianne Jean-Baptiste to Tom Glynn-Carney, Bryan
  Cranston and Hayley Squires. Belgian director Ivo van Hove adapted – and
  reinvented – Miller’s A View from the Bridge in 2015, to enormous acclaim.
  Let’s see if alchemy strikes again. • Wyndham’s theatre, London, 13 November
  2025-7 March 2026 Comedy Whoopi Goldberg Lonely rivers have flowed to the sea,
  to the sea, since Ghost star Whoopi Goldberg last brought her comedy to the
  UK. Now, the 69-year old plays two gigs, in London and Cardiff, combining
  standup with convivial conversation about her life and storied career. •
  Hammersmith Apollo, London, 4 September, and Utilita Arena Cardiff, 5
  September Tim Key Riding high on the cinema success of The Ballad of Wallis
  Island – although you would never know it from his comedy – the rumpled
  fortysomething returns with Loganberry, a new show about middle age. Expect
  wistful, offbeat standup/poetry about ageing, singledom, impertinent podcasts
  and Key-list celebrity. • Wilton’s Music Hall, London, 10-22 November Joe
  Kent-Walters A working men’s club MC in a pact with the devil? That’s Frankie
  Monroe, Joe Kent-Walters’s comedy character – painted of face and ruffled of
  shirt – before whom two successive Edinburgh fringe festivals have now
  quivered. Now his creator takes Frankie, and his tales of entertainment and
  the underworld, on the road. • Soho theatre, London, 17-29 November, then
  touring Stevie Martin A problem many young comics face is how to translate
  online success to the stage. Stevie Martin, with plenty of experience in both
  camps (and a recent breakout stint on Taskmaster to boot), turns that
  conundrum into ingenious and silly multimedia show Clout, which delighted last
  summer’s Edinburgh fringe and is now touring. • Soho theatre, London, 22-27
  September, then touring Josie Long More so than other comics – perhaps because
  she is so open personally and politically – Josie Long’s shows have for 20
  years provided us with an alternative chronicle of our times. With Now Is the
  Time of Monsters, she turns from the benighted 2020s to prehistory, to
  consider “discovery, wonder and extinction”. • Mull theatre, Tobermory, 6
  September, then touring Dance The Bride and the Goodnight Cinderella It is
  rare that a performance has the capacity to be genuinely shocking, but this is
  one. Brazilian writer-performer Carolina Bianchi vividly addresses the subject
  of sexual violence (and her own experience of rape) by drinking a date rape
  drug on stage and letting the show play out as she slips into unconsciousness.
  • Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 17-18 September Shobana Jeyasingh Dance: We
  Caliban A choreographer of probing intelligence and consummate craft,
  Jeyasingh rewrites Shakespeare’s The Tempest from the point of view of
  Caliban, forced into servitude following the arrival of Prospero and his
  daughter. It is an impressionistic tale of power lost and regained, seeded
  with contemporary resonance and influences from Jeyasingh’s life. • Snape
  Maltings, Aldeburgh, 20 September, then touring Jaivant Patel Company: Astitva
  South Asian dance and queer identity meet in Patel’s new work, Astitva, which
  launches the newly renamed Bradford Arts Centre (formerly Kala Sangam) after a
  multimillion pound refurbishment. The arts centre’s programme is strong on
  dance, with forthcoming shows from Akeim Toussaint Buck, Joss Arnott and
  Northern Rascals alongside community events. • Bradford Arts Centre, 9-10
  October, then touring The Sleeping Beauty Lavish classical ballet in all its
  glory from English National Ballet. A picture of elegance, The Sleeping Beauty
  is one of the ultimate tests of dancers’ technique, not least Aurora’s taxing
  Rose Adagio. This is Kenneth MacMillan’s production from 1967, based on Marius
  Petipa’s 19th-century choreography with Tchaikovsky’s glorious score. •
  Liverpool Empire, 23-25 October; Palace theatre, Manchester, 19-22 November;
  Mayflower theatre, Southampton, 26-29 November Wayne McGregor: Infinite Bodies
  A major exhibition dedicated to the work of choreographer Sir Wayne McGregor,
  exploring 30 years of research – with multiple collaborators – into physical
  intelligence and the intersection between bodies and technology. It includes
  (at the off-site West End venue Stone Nest) the UK premiere of McGregor’s new
  3D, 360-degree installation On the Other Earth. • Somerset House, London, 30
  October 2025–22 February 2026
