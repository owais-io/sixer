  That’ll do from me. Nick Ames got the tough gig of being in Monte Carlo for
  the draw. Here is his very useful summary: Here are the opponents for each of
  the six English clubs involved: Arsenal: Bayern Munich (h), Inter (a),
  Atlético (h), Club Brugge (a), Olympiakos (h), Slavia Prague (a), Kairat
  Almaty (h), Athletic Club (a) That’s Harry Kane coming to the Emirates – again
  Chelsea: Barcelona (h), Bayern Munich (a), Benfica (h), Atalanta (a), Ajax
  (h), Napoli (a), Pafos (h), Qarabag (a) Fans will not be thankful of a trip to
  Azerbaijan but a return to the Allianz Arena will bring back fond memories.
  Antonio Conte and David Luiz will both return. Liverpool: Real Madrid (h),
  Inter (a), Atlético (h), Frankfurt (a), PSV (h), Marseille (a), Qarabag (h),
  Galatasaray (a) Trent Alexander-Arnold back at Anfield. And Marcos Llorente.
  Man City: Dortmund (h), Real Madrid (a), Leverkusen (h), Villarreal (a),
  Napoli (h), Bodø/Glimt (a), Galatasaray (h), Monaco (a) Erling Haaland in
  Norway. Kevin De Bruyne’s Napoli. Leroy Sané plays for Galatasaray, by the
  way. Newcastle: Barcelona (h), PSG (a), Benfica (h), Leverkusen (a), PSV (h),
  Marseille (a), Athletic Club (h), Union S-G (a) PSG are glad they are not
  heading back to St James’ Park. Plenty of romance elsewhere. Tottenham:
  Dortmund (h), PSG (a), Villarreal (h), Frankfurt (a), Slavia Prague (h),
  Bodø/Glimt (a), Copenhagen (h), Monaco (a) Bodø in November, anyone? And a
  Super Cup rematch. Shall we see if we can dig out some of the more curious
  matchups from that: Olympiakos v Pafos is the battle of the Greek speakers
  Also with Olympiakos – they will play Real Madrid and Barcelona Tottenham go
  back to Bodø/Glimt in a rematch of last season’s Europa League semi-final.
  Erling Haaland’s Manchester City also go to Norway Marseille v Newcastle is
  very 1999 David Luiz’s Pafos head to Chelsea An all-yellow Dortmund v
  Villarreal And … Chelsea will play all four of the opponents they beat in the
  knockout stages on their way to the Champions League in 2012: Napoli, Benfica,
  Barcelona, Bayern Munich Just to be clear: those fixtures are not as they will
  be played chronologically. The schedule will be released by Uefa on Saturday.

  Galatasaray (h), Monaco (a) PSG: Bayern Munich (h), Barcelona (a), Atalanta

  Qarabag (a) Bayern Munich: Chelsea (h), PSG (a), Club Brugge (h), Arsenal (a),
  Sporting (h), PSV (a), Union Saint-Gilloise (h), Pafos (a) The nine teams from
  Pot 1 are about to be drawn one by one by Ibrahimovic, with Kaká pressing a
  button to determine their eight opponents. The balls are in their pots, the
  supercomputer is ready. Let’s get this started! While the fancy graphics are
  dancing on our screens, Adam Sutton has emailed in to offer some predictions
  for the Champions League this season: Chelsea to reach at least the
  semi-finals Bayer Leverkusen (and Ten Hag) to beat an English side away from
  home Kairat Almaty to go unbeaten at home We’ll hold you to those, Adam
  Giorgio Marchetti has arrived, which means we must be close. Uefa’s deputy
  general secretary celebrates the impact of the new 36-team league phase last
  season, pointing to the fact that it had the most goals per match in the
  competition’s history. We will, of course, get one last look at the technical
  procedure – a chance for me to realise where I’ve gone wrong so far … After a
  pretty cringe-worthy dramatised video, Zlatan Ibrahimovic is handed the Uefa
  president’s award by Ceferin. “My top 10 goals is not that bad,” he says. “The
  England goal was nice because it was against England …” Zlatan starts to head
  off stage before being reminded of his draw-conducting duties. He will be
  joined by Kaká: “The nice guy and the bad guy,” Zlatan offers. Anyway, the
  procedure. That’s what we’re here for. Here are the main points: Each team
  will play eight fixtures: against two teams from each pot, including their
  own. Which means there will be some heavyweight clashes between teams in Pot 1
  Teams cannot play anyone else from their own country at this stage One team
  cannot play more than two teams from the same country – so, for example,
  Chelsea cannot play Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid The top eight
  from the 36-team league table advance to the last 16; 8th-24th go into a
  playoff; 25th-36th are out Group-stage fixtures will take place from September
  to January Got it? If not, here’s a handy video explainer courtesy of Uefa.
  Hosts Pedro Pinto and Reshmin Chowdhury welcome Uefa president Aleksander
  Ceferin on to the stage in Monaco. Their first job is to award Chelsea a
  special plaque celebrating their achievement of winning every Uefa
  competition, culminating, of course, with their triumph in the Europa
  Conference League in May. We’ll start with the easy bit. Four pots of nine
  teams each, according to Uefa coefficient. Pot 1 1. Paris Saint-Germain (FRA)
  2. Real Madrid (ESP) 3. Manchester City (ENG) 4. Bayern Munich (GER) 5.
  Liverpool (ENG) 6. Inter (ITA) 7. Chelsea (ENG) 8. Borussia Dortmund (GER) 9.
  Barcelona (ESP) Pot 2 10. Arsenal (ENG) 11. Bayer Leverkusen (GER) 12.
  Atlético Madrid (ESP) 13. Benfica (POR) 14. Atalanta (ITA) 15. Villarreal
  (ESP) 16. Juventus (ITA) 17. Eintracht Frankfurt (GER) 18. Club Brugge (BEL)
  Pot 3 19. Tottenham (ENG) 20. PSV Eindhoven (NED) 21. Ajax (NED) 22. Napoli
  (ITA) 23. Sporting Clube de Portugal (POR) 24. Olympiakos (GRE) 25. Slavia
  Praha (CZE) 26. Bodø/Glimt (NOR) 27. Marseille (FRA) Pot 4 28. Copenhagen
  (DEN) 29. Monaco (FRA) 30. Galatasaray (TUR) 31. Union Saint-Gilloise (BEL)
  32. Qarabag (AZE) 33. Athletic Club (ESP) 34. Newcastle (ENG) 35. Pafos (CYP)
  36. Kairat Almaty (KAZ) Well, well, well. Here we go again. Three months after
  Paris Saint-Germain lifted the trophy in Munich, the Champions League begins
  to take shape again for another season. Dignitaries of the 36 qualified clubs
  are gathered at the glitzy Grimaldi Forum in Monaco to discover who their
  opponents will be in the expanded league phase, which made its debut last
  campaign to largely positive reviews. After Celtic and Rangers were dumped out
  at the playoff round this week, there will be just the six British teams
  involved – all of them English. They are Premier League champions Liverpool,
  Club World Cup winners Chelsea, Europa League conquerors Tottenham, Arsenal,
  Manchester City and Newcastle. Let’s just say Alexander Isak might be
  interested in more than one team’s set of eight fixtures. While our friends at
  Uefa talk away on stage, I will endeavour to explain the procedure for the
  draw in layman’s terms because, well, that’s the only chance I’ve got. Let’s
  have your thoughts, reactions and predictions for the Champions League this
  season – you can email me here.
