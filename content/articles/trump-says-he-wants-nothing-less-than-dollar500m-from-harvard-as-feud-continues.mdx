  Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than
  $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in
  federal funding to the Ivy League university. “Don’t negotiate with them,
  they’ve been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in
  a cabinet meeting. Trump’s comments came amid reports that his administration
  and Harvard are moving toward a potential settlement that could bring an end
  to their months-long battle over the government’s allegations that Harvard has
  not done enough to crack down on antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian
  protests. In April, Harvard became the first – and so far only – university to
  sue the Trump administration over the funding cuts. It sued again the
  following month over the government’s efforts to block the school from
  enrolling international students. The university has argued that the
  administration unlawfully slashed $2.6bn in research funding from the
  university in retaliation for the school’s refusal to comply with a series of
  demands laid out in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism task force.
  Those demands related to campus protests, academic policies and admissions
  practices. A US district judge heard arguments from both Harvard and the
  Department of Justice last month. The Department of Justice has argued that
  the federal government has the authority to cancel grants when institutions
  violate presidential directives, and have cited Trump’s executive order
  purporting to combat antisemitism. The New York Times and the Associated Press
  have both reported that Harvard and the White House had made substantial
  progress toward a deal. Under the proposed agreement, according to the Times,
  Harvard would pay $500m in exchange for the restoration of billions in frozen
  federal research funds. However, key terms reportedly remain unresolved, with
  negotiations still continuing. The Harvard president, Alan Garber, has
  disputed the Times report, reportedly telling faculty that the article was
  inaccurate and alleged that the information had been leaked to the press by
  White House officials. According to Harvard Crimson, the university’s student
  newspaper, Garber said the university remains committed to resolving the
  matter through the courts and that academic freedom was nonnegotiable in any
  deal. In July, it was also reported that Harvard agreed to comply with federal
  demands to turn over employment records for thousands of staff members. Since
  taking office in January, Trump and his administration have made unprecedented
  efforts to reshape higher education, targeting elite universities over their
  handling of the pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, DEI
  programs and more. Several other universities that have faced federal funding
  cuts – including Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania – have
  reached settlement agreements with the administration to restore research
  funding. Columbia University agreed to pay more than $220m and implement a
  series of reforms to settle allegations that it was not doing enough to combat
  antisemitism. However, some education advocates decried that deal as a blow to
  academic freedom.
