  On Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage in June, Celeste appeared wearing smeared black
  eye makeup and a leather jacket moulded with the impression of feathers,
  latched at the throat. She evoked glamour and tragedy, a bird with its wings
  clipped. “My first album came out nearly five years ago and I didn’t expect it
  to take so long,” she said of its follow-up. “But I’m here now.” Celeste broke
  through in 2020, her voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday’s racked beauty, but
  sparkling with a distinctly British lilt: a controlled, powerful vibrato that
  stirs the soul. Despite her jazz-leaning balladry not being obvious chart
  fodder, she became the first British female act in five years to reach No 1
  with her debut album, Not Your Muse, which was nominated for the Mercury
  prize. She also won the BBC’s Sound of 2020 poll and the Brit award for rising
  star and was nominated for an Oscar for best original song (for Hear My Voice
  from The Trial of the Chicago 7) the year after – but her chance to capitalise
  on those accolades was stalled by the pandemic. She had to halt her touring
  ambitions. Of the years since, she says: “Sometimes you worry: are you on your
  path?” Celeste was haunting and spectacular when I saw her at Glastonbury, but
  now, as we stroll through Hyde Park in central London, she is relaxed and
  laughs easily. She becomes distracted by a carousel ride – “They’re my
  favourite! I love the music” – then she is back to talking about the five-year
  struggle to make her excellent second album, Woman of Faces, which will be
  released in November. “The title was kind of a diagnosis of how I feel
  sometimes; a device to help me begin to understand my own complexity,” she
  says. She was born Celeste Waite in California to a mother from Dagenham, east
  London, and a Jamaican father. Her mother had found her way to Hollywood as a
  makeup artist and Celeste was born “quite quickly” after her parents met
  there. They separated when Celeste turned one and she and her mother moved to
  England to live in Celeste’s grandparents’ home. “It was almost like my mother
  was my sister, because we were both being looked after by my nan and grandad.”
  These are happy memories, but she has “these different weathers in my brain …
  I’ve always had this little tinge of melancholy.” Maybe, she says, it stems in
  part from a lack of rootedness: “You move from America to England and you
  don’t really remember it, but you know that there’s people that you’ve known
  there and built connections with. And then you don’t have that.” She wondered
  if she would end up with a mental health diagnosis, “something more clinical
  later on down the line. But I didn’t feel I really needed that.” Instead, she
  found solace in other artists’ music, “people’s lyrics and emotions and
  melodies, even how they dress themselves – that’s always been quite a big
  remedy without needing to have a professional”. While she is frequently
  compared to Adele and Amy Winehouse, unlike them Celeste did not attend the
  Brit school of performing arts, instead studying music technology at
  sixth-form college in Brighton and working in a pub as she got her career off
  the ground. “I’m really glad I taught myself to sing,” she says, arguing that
  it gives her “rawness and authenticity”. Her venture into music was galvanised
  by the death of her father from lung cancer when she was 16: “When you lose
  someone, every day you wake up and you’re stunned by the fact that they’re
  gone. And there’s a certain point where you say to yourself: I can’t do this
  any more, and that’s when you start to either go to the gym or get into a
  practice. For me, that was where I picked up music and became really focused.”
  In the mid-2010s, she started uploading music to YouTube and SoundCloud and
  got a manager. She was picked up as a guest vocalist for producers such as
  Avicii, while Lily Allen’s label released her debut single. “I worked double
  shifts in a pub on weekends to afford to go to the studio,” she says. “It took
  my energy away and I wasn’t able to sing as well any more.” But she carried on
  doggedly, got signed to the major label Polydor, bagged the 2020 John Lewis
  Christmas ad soundtrack and beguiled listeners on songs such as Strange, in
  which her vocal tone expresses every contradictory emotion in a breakup –
  resignation, hurt, bafflement, poignancy, even a kind of helpless amusement at
  how awful it all is – in just four minutes. She is clear that she has received
  plenty of support and encouragement within Polydor: “The people that signed me
  came into music with the intention to make meaningful, poignant, credible
  music.” But at the commercial end of the industry, there is still “a huge
  pressure to make money. If you’re not in the top 2% of acts who have such a
  huge fanbase, you maybe don’t get the freedom” to do adventurous work. She
  says that developing her initial sound caused friction. “I was hanging around
  all these jazz musicians like Steam Down and Nubya Garcia, real innovators,
  and it wasn’t easy for me to go into the label and be like: this is what I
  want to do.” She has managed to preserve a sense of strangeness and
  singularity. Unlike her earlier peppy soul-pop hit Stop This Flame, familiar
  to millions as backing music on Sky Sports, most of the songs on Woman of
  Faces don’t even feature percussion – almost unthinkable in 21st-century pop –
  and there aren’t many British singers on major labels doing symphonic jazz.
  She wanted “a cinematic feel” and referenced Bernard Herrmann – a composer for
  films by Hitchcock, Welles and Scorsese – in the studio as she worked with the
  conductor Robert Ames and the London Contemporary Orchestra. “Herrmann was a
  real innovator and it’s reflected in people like Busta Rhymes sampling him [on
  Gimme Some More] all those years later. So we wanted to make sure that if we
  went into that territory of a cinematic string orchestra, it didn’t feel like
  an impression of the 1950s – it sounded like something new.” With this
  ambitious scope and Celeste shuttling between sessions in Los Angeles and
  London, it took a lot longer than expected to complete Woman of Faces. It was
  originally due to be finished by the end of 2022 and released a year later. “I
  didn’t expect it to take so long,” she says. “And if I’m really honest with
  you, at the end of 2021, into 2022, I experienced some heartache and I fell
  into such a depression about it all.” A relationship had ended. “When you lose
  the person from your life that you really love, there’s a grief that comes
  over you,” she says. The album’s first single, On With the Show, was written
  at her lowest point. “I didn’t really want to go to the studio; I didn’t
  really feel like I actually wanted to live at that point. I didn’t find
  meaning and purpose in the music.” She just had the song title, which she
  shared with her collaborator Matt Maltese. “I didn’t even have to explain to
  him what it would be about, because he just knew. We spoke about the song and
  what it needed to be.” She had also recently seen Marius Petipa’s 1898
  classical ballet Raymonda. “It’s about a woman in the Crimean war and she has
  two lovers: one is in Russia and one is in Crimea,” she says. “I could relate,
  because she was torn between these two entities: at that point, my dedication
  to music and my dedication to a person. And one was taking the energy from the
  other. So On With the Show was about me having to find the courage to let go
  of something, to meet back in with the path of my life as a singer.” Worse,
  she says, “social media had come in to erode my relationship”. As a public
  figure on social media, “people can view your relationship and have so much
  awareness of the fact that you’re even in one. There’s this really strange,
  invisible, intangible impression that interactions in that space can leave
  upon your living reality. I was upset at how much that had come to affect my
  personal, real life.” On Could Be Machine, a curveball industrial pop song
  inspired by Lady Gaga, Celeste explores the idea that “the more time we spend
  with this technology, the more we become it”. “My phone had become this
  antagonist in my life, via communication that I didn’t want to receive and the
  fact it could just be in your hand. It was quite alien, in a way. I hadn’t
  grown up with a phone stuck to my hand and it was something that I had to
  become more and more ‘one’ with in my music career.” She says that, during the
  relationship, love had reverted her to a kind of “child-like state … a really
  pure version of yourself, before the world has seeped in and shaped you”.
  Losing the person who brought her into that state meant that she had to “learn
  how to steer and guide” herself to rediscover it. She is leaning on other
  musicians to help her understand these difficult years. She cites Nina
  Simone’s song Stars, a ballad about the cruelty and melancholy of being a
  professional musician. “It says so much about the tragedy of where her life is
  at that moment in time, but then there’s so much triumph in the fact she even
  gets to express herself in that way.” Another inspiration for Woman of Faces
  was the 1951 musical romantic comedy An American in Paris and one of its
  stars, Oscar Levant, who spent time in mental health institutions. “I was
  really moved by what he seemed to carry in his being. And, I suppose, I relate
  a lot to artists who carry this pain, but their work eases it.” Whereas
  Celeste was previously in thrall to American blues and R&amp;B (“the older
  sense of what R&amp;B was in the 1940s”), down to the way she might “time
  things and phrase things and even pronounce things”, she has “learned what my
  true voice is and who I really am as a person. I still have some of that
  phrasing and pronunciation there, but I exist a lot more as myself, therefore
  I sing a lot more as myself.” Buoyed up by her and others’ art, does she feel
  happy? “Yes!” She grins and throws her hands in the air. “The main thing is
  finding happiness within the relationships I maintain around me and making
  sure those are kept really positive and nourishing.” She is glad to be in her
  30s: “Age becomes kind of taboo for a woman in the music industry – but then
  you hear people like Solange speak about women really coming into their true
  sense of who they are within their work. There’s been a shift.” And if the
  happiness in her career ever dissipates, she has decided she will simply move
  on. “I don’t really see the need to live in a feeling of oppression, when I
  know there’s so much freedom outside this world. And anyway, I’m sure I would
  find my way back to it again. But on my own terms.” • Woman of Faces is
