  Any five-year-old can grow runner beans (Letters, 24 August)? Not this year.
  After more than 40 years of growing vegetables, the drought has defeated me.
  Repeated sowings and constant watering eventually yielded a few sickly runners
  that struggled up the canes. A handful of beans have presented themselves.
  Next year, I think I’ll look for some sort of edible cactus. Or maybe plant an
  olive grove. Anne Dyas Dorridge, West Midlands • I’m so tired of hearing
  politicians, when being interviewed, prefixing what they say with “Well,
  look…” or just “Look…” No, I won’t be told to look, and where am I supposed to
  look in any case? I have taken to looking at the floor (and counting to 10).
  Can something be done? I am almost prepared to vote for anyone who desists
  from this practice – whatever they might go on to say. Dale R Hewitt Romsey,
  Hampshire • Due to the rise in the prices of eggs, butter and chocolate
  (Report, 26 August), it seems I am no longer allowed to have my cake or eat
  it! Stuart Harrington Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset • When I change for swimming I
  put my spectacles in one case, obviously, and my hearing aids in another
  (Letters, 26 August). Tony Meacock Norwich • While Saint George was born in
  Turkey (Letters, 26 August), he lived in his mother’s country, Palestine. Kit
  Jackson London • Let us not forget: Saint George is also the patron saint of
  Moscow. Margaret Kemp Shrewton, Wiltshire • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
  read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
  considered for publication in our letters section.
