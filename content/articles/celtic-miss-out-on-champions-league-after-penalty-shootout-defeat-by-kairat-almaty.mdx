  Beyond midnight, many miles beyond the borders of Europe, Temirlan Anarbekov
  was writing his name into Celtic infamy. The 21‑year‑old rookie goalkeeper had
  made the penalty shootout saves that guided Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty into
  the Champions League group stage. Adam Idah, Luke McCowan and Daizen Maeda
  each saw attempts saved by a keeper turned to in emergency. Kasper Schmeichel,
  his opposite number, could only offer congratulations as Celtic incurred the
  heavy cost of a poor performance over 210 goalless minutes before their lack
  of composure from the spot. The Celtic board’s unpopular decision to wait for
  transfer business until Champions League qualification was banked now looks
  prudent. But would an injection of fresh attacking talent have made a
  difference? Where does this failure leave Brendan Rodgers’s reign? To Celtic,
  reaching the elite competition would have been worth four times the
  qualification revenue and win bonuses of the Europa League. Instead, history
  and destiny lie with Kairat. From Kazakhstan, only Astana, a decade ago, had
  previously reached the Champions League group stage. Celtic will not be
  returning to the 36‑team group stage they graced last season, and from which
  they qualified into the knockouts. A “bitterly disappointed” Rodgers fronted
  up. “It’s very frustrating,” he said, harking back a year ago. “We showed a
  glimpse of what we can do at this level. But we haven’t been able to show that
  over the course of these two games.” Domestic dominance had allowed rotation
  from a weekend win against Livingston but a lack of quality peers is
  suboptimal for a key engagement so early in a season. That lack of fresh
  talent had caused fretting among Bhoys supporters, 300 of whom had travelled
  3,500 miles to Central Asia. In Almaty, new calls of “sack the board” were
  heard. An Old Firm derby with Rangers follows this Sunday. “We all know the
  consequence,” Rodgers said. “If you don’t win the tie, then you drop into the
  Europa League. We want to be in the Champions League but we aren’t.” On a hot
  evening in an open-plan, hostile stadium, Rodgers’s team struggled to break
  down a high-energy, highly motivated opponent. They returned to Glasgow in
  sorrow, embarking on what their manager described as a “long, long journey …
  we’ll just get back early hours of tomorrow morning and then we’ll get ready
  for another big game Sunday”. Not until midway through the first half did
  James Forrest have the first Celtic chance, saved by Anarbekov, standing in
  for the injured regular Aleksandr Zarutskiy, laying a marker for later
  heroics. Within a drab first half, high stakes flatlined entertainment value.
  Amid humidity and high altitude, Celtic levels dropped even from their equally
  drab first‑leg performance. Callum McGregor’s blocked shot was their second –
  and last – effort of the half. “It was pretty scrappy, but we had moments and
  on another night probably go through, but you know, we’d have to suck it up,”
  said McGregor, the captain. “We are so disappointed. We really want Champions
  League football, but it shows you that on any given night you have to be on
  the level. If you don’t quite carry the luck and you’re not quite there, then
  you won’t go through.” Rodgers made copious notes during the first half but
  Celtic still lacked fluency in the second. Schmeichel almost came to grief
  when McGregor volleyed the ball backwards. In panic, the keeper punched the
  ball. An indirect free-kick resulted but Jorginho could only clatter into a
  mass of hooped shirts. Extra time and midnight local time beckoned, only for a
  golden chance to fall Maeda’s way. Played clean through by McGregor, Anarbekov
  surging out, a wealth of options presented but the finish lacked any
  composure. Another 30 minutes of stalemate followed. There, concerted Celtic
  pressure at last arrived but Kairat held firm. Penalties would decide the far
  less lucrative fork in the road Celtic must now take. The Kazakh club are
  headed to Europe’s promised land.
