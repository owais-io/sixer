  For the past year, nine-year-old Brigitte has lived with her parents in a
  converted garage, behind a house, in Salinas, California. Her bedroom is just
  about big enough to bust out some K-pop dance moves, though not spacious
  enough for her parents to agree to get her the cat she dreams of. There’s no
  outdoor space, or a living room, but the family no longer has to share a
  kitchen, bathroom or fridge with two other families, like they did when they
  first moved here from Oaxaca, Mexico, three years ago. “It was difficult,”
  said Brigitte, of being the only kid in the three-bedroom house packed with
  three families. She did her homework on a small table in the bedroom she
  shared with her parents. Families had to compete for space in the kitchen; the
  bathroom was always occupied, so they often couldn’t shower until 10pm; and
  the residents were constantly battling over the car parking space. Nancy,
  Brigitte’s mom, who works in Castroville packaging cauliflower, artichokes and
  broccoli, said she was always cleaning up after others and she mostly hid the
  family’s food in their bedroom because “we shared the fridge but they didn’t
  respect your food and would eat it.” Their rent for the room in the shared
  house was $1,000, plus utilities, for the first year, but then the price was
  hiked to $1,300. Brigitte’s father, Cruz, who works at a car wash, said what
  prompted them to move was “the stress of being there constantly battling, of
  coming home from work exhausted and having to clean up the kitchen and the
  bathroom after others, with none of the others helping”. The family met with
  the Guardian at a playground in Salinas because they were not allowed to have
  guests over to their garage where they pay $1,800 a month. “It’s really
  expensive here to rent a house with our salaries,” said Cruz. The number of
  children living in a precarious housing situation in California has risen
  significantly in recent years. In 2021, the state started requiring schools to
  fill out a housing questionnaire to understand their students’ housing
  situation. And while the survey does not capture all unhoused children, it
  nonetheless paints a troubling picture. The number of students experiencing
  homelessness in California rose by almost 20,000 in 2024, reaching an average
  of 4%, the highest rate of student homelessness in a decade, according to the
  Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC). Increased awareness among school
  leaders may account for some increases in the numbers. But the numbers are
  based on a single-day count in October 2024, meaning they are almost certainly
  an undercount. Students are considered homeless if they lack a fixed, regular
  and adequate night-time residence. It includes students living on the street,
  in shelters, in motels, in cars, doubled up with other families or living in
  garages, like Brigitte. Homeless students face steep educational barriers –
  they are more likely to miss school, switch schools frequently, face
  suspension, and attend schools with high rates of poverty. Compared with their
  peers, they are also less likely to meet academic standards, graduate high
  school or pursue college. Preventing such outcomes is both socially and
  economically beneficial for the student and for the state. Across California,
  the statewide average of 4% student homelessness masks sharp local
  disparities. In Monterey county, the rural central county where Brigitte and
  her family live, 16% of kids enrolled in public school have experienced
  homelessness at some point – the highest percentage in California by a long
  shot – up from 4.2% a decade ago, according to California department of
  education data. “It’s a pretty staggering statistic to consider,” said Brett
  Guinan, one of the authors of the PPIC report, adding, to underscore the
  magnitude of the problem, that the increase in Monterey county student
  homelessness was happening as overall school enrollment was at a historic low
  in the county – meaning that more students are reported as homeless, even
  though fewer students are part of the survey. Students living doubled up
  several families to a house or in a converted garage, like Brigitte and her
  parents, account for the majority of California’s homeless students. More than
  90% of the homeless youth in Monterey county live doubled up, according to the
  latest cumulative data from the California office of education. Precarious
  living has become increasingly common in the region, as the state faces rent
  inflation, wage stagnation and a longstanding housing crisis. California
  renters are already stretched thin – but in Salinas, they’re skint: 57.1%
  spend more than a third of their income just to keep the lights on and a roof
  overhead. Meanwhile, some funding earmarked to help unhoused students have
  dried up, Guinan said, including $99m in federal pandemic relief funds
  dedicated to homeless students. “All of that funding has now expired, and
  there is a lot of uncertainty over what funding for homeless students will
  look like moving forward,” Guinan said. In Monterey county, the classroom is
  not just a place of learning, it’s a frontline in the fight against child
  homelessness. With housing costs surging and wages stagnant, local school
  districts have become de facto safety nets for the most vulnerable students,
  ensuring they’re not left behind simply because they lack a fixed address.
  “Our job in the school district isn’t to fix homelessness,” said Donna Smith,
  who has been coordinating the services for Homeless Children and Youth at the
  Monterey county office of education for the past six years, “it’s to provide
  services to students experiencing homelessness.” That includes everything from
  school supplies, hygiene kits and clothing to transportation, tutoring and
  help navigating the healthcare system. For families in crisis, even basic
  paperwork can become a barrier, she said. By law, homeless children must be
  enrolled in school without delay, even if they lack birth certificates,
  vaccination records or other documents. To make sure there are no learning
  gaps, the school district’s homelessness liaison team will “enroll the
  students right away and then work backwards” to get the necessary paperwork,
  said Smith. Staff offer “wraparound services” – holistic support that adapts
  to the severity of a student’s needs. “Some students might not need anything,”
  said Smith. “Or they may just need a backpack and then you’ll never see them
  again. And then some families need more ongoing support – maybe they need help
  with food.” The school staff can assist families of homeless students find
  housing, and have grants to help put a deposit on an apartment or pay rental
  arrears “so they don’t become homeless”, said Smith. School staff are trained
  to recognize signs of housing instability and to notify teachers who can
  modify assignments. “We know that kids living in shelters can’t always do
  their homework – it’s loud,” she said, so academic expectations can be
  adjusted. Smith has seen families living doubled-up two or more families
  sharing a home, often crammed into single rooms, converted garages or worse.
  “Sometimes there’s a couple of families living together, sometimes three,” she
  explains. “I’ve seen converted garages – or unconverted ones – where a whole
  family is living.” Homelessness here cuts across employment and immigration
  status. “These are not necessarily children of migrant families,” Smith
  emphasizes. “Maybe their families are sick, or they lost a job, or they do
  have a job, but it’s not enough to pay the rent.” In Monterey county, about
  13% of homeless students are migrants compared with the average of about 3%
  statewide. In some agricultural pockets around Salinas, Smith said the
  situation was even more dire. “I know they had families staying in hothouses,”
  she said, referring to an incident in 2023 where a farmer was fined for having
  illegally converted greenhouses into makeshift housing for some 100 people,
  including many women and children as young as two. “There were many, many
  families living together in those. They got shut down because it’s illegal.”
  Seeing kids from migrant families doing their homework on boxes on the floor,
  as their families struggled to rent informal living species, like hallways, is
  what inspired Alexa Johnson, executive director of Monterey county’s housing
  resource center, to switch her focus from migrant education to housing. “The
  cost of rent is increasing, but the amount of money that folks get paid is
  remaining the same,” said Johnson, pulling up a graph on her computer screen
  of the rate at which people are using the section 8 rental-subsidy vouchers
  the government provides to help low-income Americans. “Right now, in our
  county it’s back up to 74% – where it was during the pandemic.” The housing
  crisis in Monterey county is getting worse for everyone, not just migrant
  families, but there are challenges unique to families working in seasonal
  agricultural work, many of whom are undocumented. Non-US citizens aren’t
  eligible for many federal and state housing subsidies, so families work
  selling tamales or doing childcare on the side in between harvests, said
  Johnson. But this kind of precarious cash-based work doesn’t come with pay
  stubs to show a prospective landlord. “When a season ends, where are you
  getting the money for your rent? A lot of them will get unemployment during
  that time, but it doesn’t cover what they need for all of their expenses and
  rent,” said Johnson. And for children studying “housing is the crucial piece
  of the puzzle that’s missing,” said Johnson remembering the pandemic when kids
  without wifi couldn’t log in to Zoom for remote learning. “So you start just
  seeing how important housing was to the overall wellbeing of not only that
  child, but the family.” All pandemic-era federal funding that helped school
  districts identify and support homeless children expired this school year
  leaving uncertainty about not only the future of resources, but school
  districts’ ability to accurately track how many students are in need of them.
  “I suspect that the numbers [of homeless students] will probably go down as we
  lose our ability to identify these students,” said PPIC’s Brett Guinan. “If
  they don’t have funding for separate staff to track them down or for
  additional hours for their current staff, the ability to capture the complete
  picture is limited, even if the schools are trying their best.” In Monterey
  county, the worry for homeless students who are undocumented isn’t just food,
  clothes or accurate headcounts – it’s whether Immigrations and Customs
  Enforcement raids will drive them out of school entirely. “Our kids are
  fearful. Our families are fearful, and as these Ice raids ramp up, I can tell
  you, we are going to see our attendance at school in the fall decline,” said
  Dr Deneen Guss, superintendent of schools serving Monterey county’s 72,000
  students. “We already know it’s going to happen because we’re hearing families
  saying they don’t wanna go to the doctor. They don’t wanna leave their house.”
  Brigitte’s family used to spend most of their days outside the house at parks,
  but with the fear of Ice raids, they have been spending more time cooped at
  home. Nancy loves baking desserts and decorative jellos and dreams of a real
  kitchen, rather than the kitchenette of her converted garage. Cruz dreams of a
  house with a big yard and a fireplace, but isn’t holding his breath. “I want
  to have a bunch of animals in my house and I want to have a brother, but
  sometimes I don’t want to,” said Brigitte pausing to think about how a baby
  brother might fit into the house, before adding: “I want to work hard to give
  my mom and my dad a new car, shoes, and things that are good.”
