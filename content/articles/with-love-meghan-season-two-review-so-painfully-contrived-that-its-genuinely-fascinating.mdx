  “I like recipes that take, like, four hours. I don’t do fast recipes at all. I
  like to braise.” “Wow, that is so fascinating.” Is it though? Is it? Netflix
  is clearly gambling that it is. The second series of With Love, Meghan is with
  us, albeit alongside the news that the Sussexes’ new deal with the streaming
  platform is not another $100m (£74m), five-year extravaganza, but a rather
  less spectacular first-look agreement that gives Netflix first refusal on any
  shows the couple create. Queer Eye for the Straight Guy fashion expert Tan
  France puts fresh bread in the toaster before making french toast to make it
  more absorbent. “That’s so good for people to know!” says Meghan. Is it
  though? Is it? Such questions – well, slight variations on that one question –
  abound as we return to see what Meghan is cooking up/assembling from fruit,
  flowers, twine and name tags in a stranger’s kitchen in Montecito. The high
  point is probably Chrissy Teigen – model, mom, author and braising fan, with
  whom Meghan once worked as a briefcase holder on Deal Or No Deal – and an
  almost thrillingly insultingly brief appearance by her music mogul husband,
  John Legend. Teigen is good value, as the pair reminisce about lining up to
  have their false eyelashes put on by the Deal crew then peeling them off and
  dropping them in a bag on their way out at the end of the day, possibly to be
  used again. Teigen has tattoos of her four children’s birthdates on her arm
  but some are too blurry to read, so she has to shout to John to check what
  they are, and complains about her knees as they squat to cut flowers in the
  garden. I warm to her considerably. I may even voluntarily watch a lifestyle
  show she presented. For Tan, Meghan produces lavender-grey lattes (“Doesn’t
  that just sound chic?”) and after that the hits just keep on coming. Meghan
  has more fruit platters (“Grapes create that bounty I was talking about”). She
  has a passion for being a mum that was evident even in early childhood when
  she spent her allowance on a real diaper bag for her dolls. She has loving
  anecdotes about “H” (He said “I love you” first; she ruined a roast chicken
  for him on an early date because she failed to convert fahrenheit to celsius),
  Archie and Lilibet (they say “zebra” not “zee-bra”), and still issues no
  apology for calling the child Lilibet. She has an express flower-pressing kit,
  ie uses the microwave instead of 40 sheets of blotting paper and patience,
  which I find myself objecting to quite strongly. She used the phrase “moving
  meditation” twice – which, if I have translated from Californian fahrenheit to
  British celsius correctly, means anything you take yourself off to do rather
  than filing for divorce. Not that there is any suggestion that such thoughts
  ever cross her mind. All is well in Meghan’s world. She’s still sprinkling
  flowers over everything, by the way. I don’t know if it’s a choice or a
  compulsion, but if you stand still long enough in (not) Meghan’s kitchen, the
  chances are you will be covered in violets and served alongside a mug of grey
  foam to a nano-celebrity who is beginning to realise he has not been paid
  enough. It’s so boring, so contrived, so effortfully whimsical that, do you
  know what? In the end, it does become almost fascinating. You find yourself
  wondering things you would never normally wonder, such as, what would it take
  for me to embark on making vegan macaroons? How large a part of Meghan wants
  to run screaming for the hills? How excited could I get about tiny eggs from
  silkie chickens? What if I were being paid the thick end of $100m to do so,
  before my original deal ran out? Above all, the real question is, what do you
  think Pippa Middleton makes of the whole thing? After the mauling she got for
  one little book about party planning, do you think she revels in the criticism
  Meghan’s efforts attract or is pig-sick that she couldn’t parlay her way into
  a lucrative series of her own? Or is she busy taking notes (“A sourdough
  starter? Five years after everyone else has thrown theirs in the bin? On it!”)
  and revering the flower-strewing powerhouse as a god? Bring me a lavender-grey
  latte and answers, please. • With Love, Meghan is on Netflix now
