  Pork creates a deliciously juicy burger and its mild flavour allows the other
  ingredients to stand out – the boldness of ’nduja, a spicy, spreadable salami,
  and the sweet, smoky flavour of Tesco Finest Italian scamorza, a mozzarella
  made in the Puglia region and smoked over beechwood chips. Top with a fresh
  and crunchy fennel slaw and assemble in a buttery Tesco Finest brioche bun for
  the perfect summer burger! Prep 40 min Cook 20 min Serves 4 1 tbsp Tesco
  Finest Sicilian extra virgin olive oil 2 Tesco Finest echalion shallots,
  thinly sliced 400g Tesco Finest pork mince 30g Tesco Finest ‘nduja Fine sea
  salt 100g mayonnaise 1 lemon, juiced 1 garlic clove, finely grated Pinch sweet
  smoked paprika 4 Tesco Finest brioche burger buns 120g Tesco Finest Italian
  smoked scamorza mozzarella, thinly sliced into four rounds For the fennel
  salad 1 fennel bulb, thinly sliced Pinch chilli flakes 1⁄2 tbsp olive oil 1
  small lemon, juiced 100g Tesco Finest sundried tomatoes with basil, roughly
  chopped Handful fresh basil, chopped Suggested wine pairing Piccodoro nero
  d’avola Heat the oil in a large frying pan. Add the shallots and fry over a
  low heat with a pinch of salt for 12-15 minutes or until softened. Set aside
  to cool. Tip the pork mince into a large bowl with the shallots, ’nduja and
  half a teaspoon of fine sea salt. Mix everything together by squishing with
  your hands. Set aside in the fridge until needed. In a large bowl toss
  together the fennel, chilli flakes, olive oil and some salt. In a separate
  bowl mix the mayonnaise, garlic, lemon and the smoked paprika. Heat a
  non-stick frying pan over a medium-high heat. Divide the meat into four balls.
  Put two in the pan and cover each with a square of parchment, then weigh down
  with something heavy like a skillet pan. Fry over a high heat for 2 minutes on
  each side. Take off the parchment, add the cheese on top of the burgers, lower
  the heat, put a lid on the pan and cook for 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese
  is melted. Remove from the pan and repeat with the remaining pork balls. Split
  the buns open and fry them, cut-side down for a minute or two in the oil left
  in the pan. Just before serving, toss the lemon juice and sundried tomatoes
  with basil into the fennel slaw. Fill each bun with a dollop of garlic
  mayonnaise, a burger and the fennel slaw. Shop the ingredients for this recipe
