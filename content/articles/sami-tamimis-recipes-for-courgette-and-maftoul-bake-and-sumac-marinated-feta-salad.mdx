  Bursting with sunshine flavours and garden-fresh ingredients, today’s
  all-in-one courgette, sweetcorn and maftoul dish is a wholesome celebration of
  summer in every bite. Layered with tender courgettes, sweet pops of corn,
  aromatic herbs and warm spices, it’s all brought together with nutty maftoul
  (or fregola) and a golden, cheesy crust. Then, a vibrant salad combining juicy
  tomatoes and sweet strawberries with tangy, sumac-marinated feta. Colourful
  and packed with bold Palestinian flavours, it’s the perfect balance of sweet,
  salty and zesty – ideal for alfresco dining or picnics. Tomato, strawberry and
  sumac-marinated feta salad (pictured top) Prep 35 min Marinate 15 min+ Serves
  4 as a side 150g feta, cut into ½cm cubes 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp ground sumac
  ½ tsp lemon zest A pinch of aleppo chilli flakes, or regular chilli flakes
  Salt and black pepper 300g cherry tomatoes, ideally a mix of colours, halved
  200g strawberries, hulled and halved or quartered 1 small shallot (30g),
  peeled and sliced into thin half-moons 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil ½ tbsp
  lemon juice 1 tsp apple cider vinegar 1 tbsp pomegranate molasses 90g mixed
  salad leaves 30g shelled roasted pistachios, roughly chopped 5g fresh mint
  leaves 3g fresh basil leaves First marinate the feta. In a small bowl, toss
  the feta with the olive oil, sumac, lemon zest, chilli flakes and a grind of
  black pepper, then set aside for at least 15 minutes (or refrigerate for up to
  two hours). Put the tomatoes, strawberries and shallot in a large bowl. Add
  the extra-virgin olive oil, lemon juice, vinegar, pomegranate molasses,
  three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then
  toss gently to combine. Arrange the mixed leaves on a large platter, then
  spoon the tomato-strawberry mixture over the top. Scatter on the marinated
  feta, garnish with the chopped pistachios, mint and basil, and serve.
  Courgette, sweetcorn and maftoul bake Comforting yet light, this dish makes a
  perfect centrepiece for a summer lunch or vibrant side. Prep 15 min Cook 40
  min Serves 4 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to finish 2 large garlic cloves,
  peeled and crushed 1 green chilli, thinly sliced 2 courgettes (400g), one
  yellow, if possible, thinly sliced 2-3 spring onions (40g), finely sliced 1
  tbsp fresh oregano leaves (3g), roughly chopped ½ tsp dried mint ½ tsp ground
  cumin ½ tsp ground coriander Salt and black pepper 300g sweetcorn kernels,
  fresh or frozen 170g maftoul, or fregola 5g each fresh coriander, mint and
  dill, all roughly chopped, plus extra mint to finish 500ml vegetable stock, or
  chicken stock 65g grated mozzarella 65g grated cheddar Heat the oil in a large
  pan, then add the garlic and chilli and fry on a medium heat for one minute,
  until fragrant. Add the sliced courgettes, spring onions, oregano, spices, a
  half-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, and cook, stirring
  often, for five minutes. Mix in the sweetcorn, maftoul and chopped herbs, pour
  in the stock, add half a teaspoon of salt and stir to combine. Bring to a
  boil, cover and cook on a low heat for 20 minutes, until the maftoul is cooked
  through and has absorbed most of the stock. Sprinkle the cheeses evenly over
  the top of the maftoul mix and put under a hot grill for five minutes, until
  the cheese melts and turns golden. Garnish with a few mint leaves and finish
  with a drizzle of olive oil. Boustany: A Celebration of Vegetables from my
  Palestine, by Sami Tamimi, is published by Ebury Press at £30. To order a copy
