  Americans have been advised that some packages of a brand of vodka seltzers
  have been mistakenly mislabeled as a non-alcoholic high energy drink,
  triggering a recall announcement from High Noon, the alcoholic beverage brand,
  that was posted by the the US Food and Drug Administration. In a statement,
  High Noon said two lots of High Noon Beach Variety 12-packs contain cans
  mislabeled as “CELSIUS® ASTRO VIBE Energy Drink, Sparkling Blue Razz Edition”.
  “Consumption of the liquid in these cans will result in unintentional alcohol
  ingestion,” the brand warned. The recall was declared after High Noon
  discovered that a shared packaging supplier had mistakenly sent it empty
  Celsius cans. The recalled packs were shipped to distributors in Florida,
  Michigan, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Virginia and Wisconsin.
  High Noon said no illnesses or adverse events have so far been reported. •
  This article was amended on 31 July 2025. A previous version said the FDA
  recalled the energy drink cans when it was actually High Noon that announced
  and led the recall on its vodka seltzer products with the FDA’s awareness.
