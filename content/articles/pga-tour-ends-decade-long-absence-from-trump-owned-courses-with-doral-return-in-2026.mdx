  The PGA Tour will return to Donald Trump’s Blue Monster course in Miami next
  spring, ending a decade-long absence from Trump-owned venues. The Miami
  Championship, a $20m Signature Event scheduled for the first weekend in May
  2026, will mark the 56th time the Tour has played at Trump National Doral but
  the first since 2016, the year Trump won his first US presidential election.
  That year, the WGC-Cadillac Championship was pulled from the resort and
  relocated to Mexico City after Cadillac ended its sponsorship. At the time,
  then-commissioner Tim Finchem stressed that the decision was “fundamentally a
  sponsorship issue” and not political, despite Trump’s incendiary remarks on
  immigration and his insistence the Tour was punishing him for his first US
  presidential run. “We value dollars for our players,” Finchem said in 2016.
  “We were not able to secure sponsorship for Doral. From a golf standpoint, we
  have no issues with Donald Trump. From a political standpoint, we are
  neutral.” Trump, who had spent $250m redeveloping the Doral property, publicly
  lashed out at the Tour and quipped that he hoped officials had “kidnapping
  insurance” for the event’s new Mexican host city. For the next decade, the
  Blue Monster fell off the PGA calendar and instead became a regular site for
  the upstart LIV Golf series, serving as a centerpiece in the Saudi-backed
  league’s schedule. Now the course returns at a moment of transition for the
  PGA Tour. The Miami Championship expands the roster of Signature Events to
  nine and sits at the heart of a crowded spring. Beginning with the Masters in
  April, players will face four Signature Events and two majors in a seven-week
  stretch, with only the Zurich Classic in New Orleans breaking the run. “We’re
  excited to showcase the game’s greatest players competing at golf’s most
  iconic venues,” said Brian Rolapp, the Tour’s new chief executive. “Inspired
  by our players and fans, we’re accelerating the Tour’s evolution and ushering
  in a new era of innovation on and off the course.” The Miami Championship is
  expected to secure a title sponsor before its debut. Its addition shifts the
  Mexico Open into the FedExCup Fall and removes the Barracuda Championship in
  California, which had been played opposite the British Open. Doral has been
  synonymous with PGA Tour golf since 1962, when it launched as the Doral Open.
  It became a World Golf Championship site in 2007 but struggled to sustain
  sponsorship after Trump’s 2012 purchase of the property. The 2016 split was,
  in Finchem’s words, pragmatic rather than political, though it coincided with
  Trump’s polarizing rise.
