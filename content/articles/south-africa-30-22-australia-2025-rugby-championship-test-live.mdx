  The report is in so I’ll get out of here. Thanks all. Well done to the Boks
  and Handre Pollard for edging that one. Overall I’d give the series to
  Australia who were magnificent last week and perhaps unlucky here in Cape
  Town. They’ll fancy themselves for the rest of the Rugby Championship. Catch
  you later. If it’s any consolation to Wallabies fans, your boys won the second
  half. I keep thinking back to those two penalties that Australia turned down
  in the opening quarter. O’Connor could have slotted either to make it 13-10 to
  the Boks. Instead they went to the corner and twice came away with nothing
  around the 20 minute mark. Rugby doesn’t quite work like this but if we can
  imagine both kicks going over we might be considering a different outcome.
  Worth noting that James O’Connor missed three kicks worth eight points in a
  game lost by as many. I’m not saying that is the reason they lost. I’m also
  not not saying it. South Africa deserve that. I think that’s fair to say. Not
  just because Pollard kicked all six of his shots at goal but because on
  balance they won the breakdown battle, owned the skies and got the edge at the
  point of contact. Australia were brilliant. Again. This is a proper rugby
  team. Their work around the fringe is something else and they proved that they
  can play fast and loose as well as tight and scrappy. They can’t stick the
  landing. The line-out is a mess and the subsequent attack off sloppy ball
  fizzled out. No matter. South Africa win a tense battle. Three tries apiece
  but Handre Pollard’s boot was the difference. Not the prettiest game. But that
  was cracking Test footy. That’s a commendable loss for the Wallabies who’ll
  leave South Africa with credit in the bank. 80 min: Another review. There’s a
  neck-roll on de Jager so Handre Pollard hoofs a kick to the corner. Another
  try would see them win a bonus point. They’ll set the maul. Can they do it? 80
  min: South Africa come away with the ball. There’s an Australian knock-on.
  South Africa try to counter off the loose ball but can’t. We come back for the
  scrum. The game is won. They simply need to win the scrum, kick it out and
  take the W. 80 min: O’Connor doesn’t have the legs! That’s three misses in a
  row for the Wallaby 10. He’s nailed for a deliberate knock-on. Hard to argue.
  Ans with Australians outside him he had to go. O’Connor points to the poles
  again. He’s on halfway. Right in front. So a 50 metre shot to win a bonus
  point. 78 min: O’Connor misses! He starts it right of the poles and can’t
  bring it back round. That’s two kicks missed in a row for the Aussies. Van der
  Merwe of the Scarletts comes on to replace Marx at hooker. 77 min: Kolbe with
  a steal inside his own 22! Brilliant from the little winger who has been
  immense! Australia ground their way deep into South Africa’s territory. Slick
  hands from a few of them opened space for Jorgensen down the right. But Kolbe
  stole in and won the ball. OH! There’s a high tackle against
  Feinberg-Mngomezulu after review. So the penalty switches hands. Australia
  need to score twice so perhaps they take the kickable points from here. Even
  if they don’t win they might take a losing bonus point if O’Connor slots it
  from the right about 35 metres out on the angle. Eben stretches and gets
  there! South Africa won the scrum penalty so they had freedom to attack inside
  the Aussie’s 22. They went right with Kriel making ground. Then they went left
  where Venter charged. They came close twice. Reinach stretched and couldn’t
  get there before Etzebeth’s extra length proved the difference from close
  range. Relentless and aggressive. Pollard’s two more points makes it an eight
  point game. Australia need to score twice to rescue this. 72 min: Kellaway
  drops the ball inside his own 22! This is a huge opportunity for the
  Springboks. It came as a result of Feinberg-Mngomezulu wriggling some space
  down the right tram inside his own half. He passed for Reinach who hoofed a
  kick into space. Australia mopped up through Jorgensen who flung a pass for
  Kellaway. But the replacement 15 spilled it and now the Boks have a great set
  with space either side. 70 min: This is tense! South Africa spark a counter
  through Kolbe. It goes down the line and slick hands from the prop Louw means
  they find an edge around the Australian rush defence. Pollard to de Allende to
  Kriel. The final pass to Fassi is a tough one and the full-back/winger can’t
  keep it in play. Oh, ignore all that. We’re coming back to the opposite wing
  as Feinberg-Mngomezulu’s foot was out as he collected McDermott’s box kick.
  Line out for Australia just inside their own half. Australia within a point!
  And they’ve done it by beating the Boks at their own game. Simple rugby.
  Line-out goes to the middle and the hooker, Paenga-Amosa, joins the morass and
  manages to worm his way between the two Springboks defensive pods. It’s
  scrappy but it’s over. O’Connor misses a very gettable kick. How costly will
  that be? 67 min: Australia are keeping it tight off the line-out. Ikitau runs
  a wonderful blind line and makes ground. So does Valetini. Etzebeth gives away
  a penalty. The Aussies are hammering the fringe with short runs off
  McDermott’s accurate passing. Lovely stuff. They don’t breach the line but
  have the penalty. No points. They go for the corner and a line-out.
  Esterhuizen comes on at last and replaces Mostert. So that’s an inside centre
  playing on the flank. 65 min: South Africa look to put a second shove on Bell
  but the Aussie holds his own and stays on his feet. So Reinach picks it up and
  has time to kick a clearing kick towards halfway. Paenga-Amosa is on for Billy
  Pollard and finds his jumper with his first throw. 64 min: Kriel is still on
  the field. So why is Nche captaining? Anyway, McDermott off the scrum kicks.
  South Africa return the favour, get it back and then kick again. Ikitau gets
  the ball and Toole has it. He’s cantering up field. Chips ahead. This is
  sensational! Australia are metres out. Toole is rapid! But the Boks scramble
  and make the tackle and then turn the ball over under the shade of their own
  poles. Phew! What a let off for the Boks. That was Handre Pollard rushing
  back. The chip ahead from Toole bounced the wrong way as far as he was
  concerned. Could have been a 75 metre score. It ends with a Boks scrum deep in
  their own patch. 61 min: Billy Pollard’s throw is long and Mostert snaffles it
  on the floor. South Africa flood forward. They’re up to Australia’s 22. There
  are three spills of the ball. Referee Doleman says they’re all backwards but
  changes his mind on one from Nche that seemed to go forward. Scrum to the
  Wallabies on their own 22. Kriel is off the pitch (for Esterhuizen I’m
  guessing) so Nnche is skipper. Reinach replaces Williams at 9. 58 min:
  Jorgensen plucks a stunning catch under pressure on his right wing. That wins
  the ball back for the Wallabies after some sustained pressure from the Boks.
  Australia are on their own 22 line where McDermott hoofs a box kick.
  Feinberg-Mngomezulu gathers the bouncing before. He tries to unfurl an
  off-load back infield but it bobbles out for a Wallaby throw. Pollard has five
  from five. The Ice Man coming up with the goods yet again. 56 min: South
  Africa drop the ball off the back of a line-out but they get lucky. Ikitau is
  nailed for straying off-side in midfield. He looks befuddled. Handre Pollard
  points to the sticks. About 40 metres out pretty much in front. 55 min: Both
  teams are going to the boot. The ground is tearing up and things are getting
  slippery. A bout of kick tennis ends with thew Boks on the ball inside
  Australia’s half. Pollard tries a dink to the right wing for Moodie to chase,
  but it’s too flat and too long so Toole catches and takes the mark. Moodie,
  after dropping the ball twice, is off for the talented Feinberg-Mngomezulu.
  The new man will go to fullback with Fassi going to the left win. Kolbe shifts
  across the right. 52 min: Moodie knock-on again! How frustrating. South Africa
  were forming an attack following a McDermott clearing kick. They had numbers
  down the right after winning a couple of breakdowns on attack (remember that
  was their main issue last week). But the lanky winger couldn’t hold onto the
  greasy pill. Another scrum for the Wallabies who have Bell on the pitch. 50
  min: South Africa get through six phases after the line-out. They’re direct.
  Etzebeth and de Allende make some meaty carries. De Jager as well. They’re
  going back to basics and are making great ground. But they go one run too many
  with Etzebeth spilling in contact. Solid defence from the Aussies. Scrum to
  the men in gold inside their 22 in front of the poles. 49 min: It’s a
  ding-dong affair after the restart. Toole wins the ball on the wing but it’s
  back in the other tram in a flash with Kolbe hoisting a high kick which he
  chases. Jorgensen wins it but is clattered. From there it’s scrappy near the
  touchline and the ball spills out for a South African throw. The Aussies
  strike first! Off the scrum, O’Connor takes it flat and puts in a diagonal
  kick that has Moodie scrambling in the back field. The South African winger
  made a right mess of the bouncing ball which gave Jorgensen the chance to
  steal in and complete an easy score. Is the comeback on? It’s a three point
  game thanks to an extra two from O’Connor’s boot. 44 min: Solid with ball in
  hand from the Aussies. They get the ball back on their side after Kolbe
  knocked on a high kick. South Africa owned the skies in the first set but this
  goes the Aussies way. They go down the line until they run out of road on the
  left. It ends with a Saffa line-out. A high clearing kick following the throw
  ends with a South African hand spilling a loose ball. The Boks make a double
  change in the second row. De Jager and Etzebeth replace Snyman and Nortje. 43
  min: Nche swims through the Aussie maul and wins the ball. South Africa now
  have an attacking set inside the Wallabies 22. But de Allende gets in a muddle
  in midfield and van Staden overruns his support line. They criss-cross and
  Australia get a soft penalty and a chance to exit. 42 min: South Africa win
  the ball out the scrum and go down the line. Fassi rakes a grubber to the
  corner. Finds touch. Australia will have the line-out inside their 22. 41 min:
  That’s a poor start from Edmed. His first job is to get the game going again
  and he hoofs the kick long. South Africa get the scrum on halfway and will no
  doubt look to force a penalty. Correction, O’Connor is still on the field.
  It’s Suaalii who has been repalced. HIA. We may see him again. We’re back.
  There’s a change at half-time for the Wallabies with 25-year-old Tane Edmond
  coming on. I think he’s replaced James O’Connor. I’d say that’s close to a
  fair reflection of the contest but Australia might argue against that. They
  had a try disallowed and did most of the running. They were the first to cross
  the whitewash after two Pollard penalties but South Africa dotted down twice.
  It’s been direct and confrontational. It’s not been a classic but plenty to
  enjoy. Back in a bit. As the siren sounds O’Connor nails the penalty. That’s a
  good kick on the angle towards the right. 40 min: Australia keep the ball off
  the line-out but don’t do much with it. Skelton with some big carries. It’s a
  little aimless. They spill the ball in contact which gives Smith a chance to
  steal it, but he goes at just the wrong time and coughs up a soft penalty.
  This time O’Connor points to the poles and a shot at points before the
  half-time break. 38 min: South Africa secure the restart and after a few kick
  exchanges Fassi hoists a high left footer that he scampers after. It’s
  overcooked which means the Wallabies will have the throw inside South Africa’s
  half from whence it came. Kwagga through the guts! Direct, robust, South
  Africa at their best. Clean line-out on the 22 means it’s front-foot ball for
  Williams. Kriel with a big carry opened a hole and Smith, off the base of the
  pack, gathered, shook off one tackler, shrugged off another and slid over
  under the poles. Pollard clips the easy extras. Much better from South Africa.
  33 min: Neither side can keep the ball but it’s fascinating viewing. Tupou
  knocks on and South Africa counter. Smith makea ground before Valetini nails
  him. Then they kick and Australia return a kick. Fassi has it and dinks an up
  and under for himself. He gathers, steps a defender and feeds Nortje who is
  charging up field. South Africa are on the edge of the Australian 22 when they
  spill the ball in contact. Australia come away with it and kick. It ends with
  a Saffa line-out on Australia’s 22 towards the right. helter skelter stuff.
  Loving this. 31 min: Australia win a breakdown penalty. Or should that be
  South Africa give away a soft one. Van Staden goes to clean the ruck inside
  the Wallabies’ 22 but loses his feet and is pinged. Also from the side. Good
  defence from the Aussies who are cohesive. The Boks are struggling to find
  cracks in the line. 29 min: South Africa win the line-out. They’re struggling
  to get for-forward though with ball in hand. De Allende chooses to cross kick
  looking for Moodie but it’s a little long and goes out (but not before Moodie
  himself volleyed it straight out). W We’re coming back for a high hit on
  Kolbe. Hooper the guilty party I think so South Africa get the penalty which
  is kicked out on Australia’s 22. 28 min: South Africa get clean ball off the
  scrum. Twice they go to the air for their wingers to chase. Kolbe wins it on
  the left. Moodie wins it on the right but spills it as he lands. Skelton
  almost sacked Handre Pollard. The Boks fly-half must have had the fright of
  his life as the monster lock suddenly loomed in front of him. Anyway,
  Australia’s scrum on the left inside their own half. They win the ball and
  Toole, off his wing, rakes a kick looking for a 50-22. It doesn’t quite land
  but it does find touch, pinning the Saffas inside their own half and forcing
  Marx to throw just beyond his 22. 25 min: A little sloppy from both teams. Now
  it’s Australia’s turn to make a mistake at the line-out. Billy Pollard throws
  skew. Nortje was lifted to challenge which means South Africa get the ball
  back with a scrum feed on their own 22. 24 min: One step forward, two steps
  back for South Africa. After that important steal on the ground they give away
  a soft penalty at the line-out inside Australia’s half. Nortje disrupting the
  lifter in the air. So Australia will come again with a penalty kicked out
  inside their patch. Another good opportunity for the Wallabies to launch an
  attack from South Africa’s patch. 23 min: Marx disrupts the Aussie maul after
  some good ground gained by Skelton and co and that creates the fracture. Du
  Toit spots the ball and steps forward to pinch it. A great result for the
  Boks. They win the ball, spiral it down the line before Kolbe hoofs it long.
  22 min: Australia win the scrum and keep it tight. They hammer the blind side.
  Valetini hammers de Allende with a stiff carry. They keep it narrow before
  Smith gives away a penalty on the ground. Robust stuff from the Aussies who
  are prepared to face up to the bully Boks. Again they turn down the points and
  hoof to the corner. They’ll fancy themselves either with a maul or some more
  short carries around the fringe. It’s all Australia for the past 10 minutes.
  20 min: South Africa cough the ball up at the line-out and give away a scrum
  inside their own half. Skelton causing Snyman problems. Another chance for the
  Wallabies to launch an attacking set from the left. 19 min: Australia win an
  uncontested ball off the top of the line-out but quick line speed from the
  Boks defence forces them back beyond the 22. Australia go through the phases
  despite going backwards. McDermott spots a gap and makes good ground after a
  snipe around the fringe but he’s isolated and van Staden gets in to steal the
  ball once the Aussie scrum-half is tackled. That’s a good penalty win for
  South Africa who were bossed at the breakdown last week. 16 min: Pollard’s
  clearing kick doesn’t go very far so the Wallabies get a line-out just beyond
  South Africa’s 22. They go off the top with Pollard on the wraparound.
  Valetini carries before van Staden slows the ball down as McDermott goes for
  it. Rather than kick for poles Australia go to the corner. 13 min: TRY CHALKED
  OFF! Wow, McReight thought he’d scored after pouncing on a loose ball
  following a brilliant break down the right from Kellaway. Pollard collected
  the grubber ahead but was nailed by Kellaway. The ball spilled towards the SA
  try line and McReight fell onto it and celebrated. But replays show that
  Kellaway’s hand tipped it on as he made the tackle on Pollard. Australia are
  so dangerous from broken play. That is a let off for the Boks. It all ends
  with a scrum for South Africa inside their own 22 all the way on the left. The
  Boks bounce back! Moodie collects a rakiing cross-kick from coast to coast
  from Pollard. He catches after it bounces and steps infield to dot down. It
  started with a high kick from Williams that was grabbed by White. But Smith on
  onto him in a flash and flung him down onto the turf. The Boks swarmed and
  stole the turnover. Du Toit and Snyman cam close with close carries before
  Pollard kicked to the right wing where Moodie finished it off. White is off
  with an HIA after hammering the turf from that rag-doll tackle as Pollard adds
  the extras from the tee. 10 min: Whie and O’Connor are dovetailing
  beautifully. From the restart White dummies a kick and feeds O’Connor who
  hammers a clearing boot. Slick from the men in gold. TRY ON DEBUT! Sharp from
  White who puts it on a place for the sevens star. Du Toit went early on the
  scrum so the Wallabies got the freekick. White spotted the space down the
  blind on the left and tapped and kicked a grubber. Toole cantered onto the
  bouncing ball, gathered and slid over. O’Connor slots the conversion from the
  left tram and the Wallabies are in front. 7 min: Smith gathers his second
  restart. He had troubles from kick-offs in the past but he’s secure once
  again. A Williams high kick is knocked on by a man in green but the Wallabies
  can’t counter as Tupou flings a wild pass that is knocked on. Australia’s
  scrum inside South Africa’s half between halfway and the 22. Pollard doubles
  the lead. Slightly wider and further away than the last one, but that’s no
  problem for the sharpshooter. Two entries into Australia’s 22. Two exits with
  points on the board. 5 min: The Boks get a second shove at the scrum and win a
  penalty. Williams picks up and delays a pass back against the grain for Fassi
  running on from fullback. He kicks to the corner for the onrushing Kolbe. Was
  he taken out off the ball? No says the ref. But we’ll come back for a penalty
  that Pollard will aim at the poles. 4 min: South Africa clear from the scrum
  and Wright in the backfield dallies. The rush defence is on him in a flash and
  he plays a reckless pass that is knocked on by Suiaalii. Wright goes down in a
  heap. Is that an ACL? Doesn’t look good for the fullback. The Boks will have a
  scrum inside Australia’s patch but the bigger worry is the health of Wright’s
  knee. Have they switched him out? Yes they have. Kellaway on the pitch. Wright
  looks despondent. 3 min: A short restart from the Wallabies is chased by
  debutant Toole, but Wiese beats him to it and the Boks secure the ball.
  They’ll have a scrum on their own 22. Pollard doesn’t miss from there. Just to
  the right, just outside the 22. A swing of the boot and the Boks take an early
  lead. 2 min: White kicks a high box that Fassi gathers on the leap. Pollard
  returns a kick but Wright has it comfortably. The Boks swarm the breakdown and
  win a penalty on the floor just outside the Wallabies’ 22. Slight angle, well
  within range for Pollard. Kriel points to the sticks. The anthems are done.
  The pitch looks a picture. The two sets of players are snarling and flashing
  their fangs. Referee James Doleman from New Zealand blows his whistle, Handre
  Pollard kicks off and we’re away! Australia haven’t won consecutive Tests in
  South Africa since 1963. As the Impi warriors run out an the fireworks are set
  off, this feels like it could be an epic day. History beckons. I cannot wait!
  Big news that I missed! Willie le Roux is out. Aphelele Fassi is in at
  full-back! Australia haven’t beaten South Africa in back-to-back games since
  2015. Tell you what, I think they’ll do it. It’s been raining in Cape Town so
  the ball might be slipper early on. The sun is coming out but the weather in
  Cape Town is temperamental at best. Could be a factor throughout the contest.
  While you chew over the Boks’ problems in the back row, why not take a gender
  at some fine writing: Our man Angus Fontaine is in bullish spirits as he backs
  the Wallabies to do the double: Andy Bull was in Sunderland watching women’s
  rugby reach stratospheric levels last night: Sarah Rendell was also up north,
  reporting on an England rout: And Aaron Bower was on hand to watch the
  Wallaroos put Samoa to the sword: An intersting point shared on X by South
  African commentator AP Cronje: “I would honestly rather they just start Andre
  at 8 and have Kwagga come off the bench. Maybe Marco [van Staden] will play 8
  and Kwagga will be 6 - which is marginally better than the other way around.
  Either way we have problems. Pack severely lacking in momentum givers.” I
  worry for the Springboks. Not often you look at the back row and think they’re
  short of grunt but with Kwagga Smith (at 8) and Franco Mostert (at 7) playing
  out of position, you must be worried too if you’re a South African support.
  Valetini, Hooper and McReight will be licking their lips at the prospect of
  yet again commanding their sphere of influence. We’ve got our first email of
  the afternoon and it’s from a gem, Darryl Accone, looking for an old school
  chum: Hi Daniel, Back in 1969 the Wallabies lost all four Tests of the series
  to the Springboks. As a nine year old at the time, from an Eurasian family
  classified as “non-White” by the apartheid government of the day, my support
  went to the Australians. Only one other boy in our private school was rooting
  for the Wallabies: Adrian Robertson, son of the Australian ambassador to South
  Africa. If Adrian’s out there reading this, I have to say my allegiances have
  changed, mate, but it was so good to stand with you then. Ciao. The curse of
  the Boks No 8 continues. Jasper Wiese is suspended after being injured for
  some time. Elrigh Louw, Cameron Hannekom, Juarno Augustus and Siya Kolisi are
  all on the phsyio’s table. That means that Andre Esterhuizen, a centre by
  trade, has been called onto the bench. Don’t be surprised if you see him pack
  down at flank. Kwagga Smith starts, making that back row look quite light all
  of a sudden. Worrying for the Boks. The return of Rob Valetini adds heft and
  dynamism to an already accomplished back row. There’s also a debut for Corey
  Toole who starts on the wing. The 25-year-old has already had a taste of the
  big time having played in the Paris Olympics, but this will be a different
  challenge for the sevens ace. Skipper Harry Hilson is out with a knee niggle
  so the breakdown king Fraser McReight captains. James Slipper also misses out
  having failed to recover from a head knock and is replaced by Tom Robertson in
  the front row. Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt said the side had recovered well
  after the physical encounter at altitude and had identified their slow start –
  trailing 22-0 – as an area they needed to improve. “The squad as a whole has
  recovered pretty well from what was a very draining and physical Test match on
  the highveld last week,” he said in a statement. “We struggled to contain a
  powerhouse Springbok start last weekend and we know that we have to improve
  leading into what’s likely to be a bruising encounter in Cape Town.”
  Wallabies: Tom Wright; Max Jorgensen, Joseph Suaalii, Len Ikitau, Corey Toole;
  James O’Connor, Nic White; Tom Robertson, Billy Pollard, Taniela Tupou, Nick
  Frost, Will Skelton, Tom Hooper, Fraser McReight (c), Rob Valetini.
  Replacements: Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Angus Bell, Zane Nonggorr, Jeremy
  Williams, Nick Champion de Crespigny, Tane Edmed, Tate McDermott, Andrew
  Kellaway. Out with the flash, in with the grit. It’s not as simple as that, or
  is it? Manie Libbok’s razzle-dazzle has been shelved for the more pragmatic
  Handre Pollard at fly-half. The Boks have all but telegraphed that they will
  play a route one game today. Expect runners off short passes, pods of forwards
  battering the line and big meaty hits around the fringe. If they earn the
  right to go wide the returning Cheslin Kolbe will be ready to pounce. There’s
  a late change: Jean-Luc du Preez was meant to start at no. 8. He’s unwell
  which means Kwagga Smith slots in at the base of the pack. Andre Esterhuizen
  is now on the bench. And another! Aphelele Fassi comes from the cold to
  replace Willie le Roux at 15. (Cards on the table, this wasn’t a late change.
  It was in fact announced yesterday. I just missed it. Apologies) Springboks:
  Aphelele Fassi; Canan Moodie, Jesse Kriel (c), Damian de Allende, Cheslin
  Kolbe; Handre Pollard, Grant Williams; Ox Nche, Malcolm Marx, Thomas du Toit,
  RG Snyman, Ruan Nortje, Marco van Staden, Franco Mostert, Kwagga Smith.
  Replacements: Marnus van der Merwe, Boan Venter, Wilco Louw, Eben Etzebeth,
  Lood de Jager, Andre Esterhuizen, Cobus Reinach, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu. In
  the immortal words of Woody Harrelson’s Tallahassee, it’s time to nut up or
  shut up. For South Africa’s Springboks who must now dispel all talk of a
  dynasty in decline. Who must prove that their all-conquering champions are
  still a force to be reckoned with. For Australia’s Wallabies who must now
  hammer down on their gains. Who must now prove that their heroes in gold are a
  team on the rise. Last week defied expectations. From 22-0 down Australia
  roared back to claim a 38-22 win. Remarkable. Sensational. Bewildering. Take
  your pick. None of them will do it justice. Don’t expect a freewheeling Boks
  today. Rassie Erasmus has promised to bring the thunder with good old
  fashioned Saffa rugby. They’ll be direct. They’ll be aggressive. They will do
  whatever they can to deny the Wallabies loose forwards opportunity to boss the
  breakdown once again. Can they do it? Or will wily Joe Schmidt orchestrate
  another heist? We’ll find out together. Kick-off at 5:10 pm local time, 4:10
  pm in the UK and 0:10 am AEST. Teams and other bits to come.

The report is in so I’ll get out of here. Thanks all. Well done to the Boks and Handre Pollard for edging that one. Overall I’d give the series to Australia who were magnificent last week and perhaps unlucky here in Cape Town. They’ll fancy themselves for the rest of the Rugby Championship. Catch you later. If it’s any consolation to Wallabies fans, your boys won the second half. I keep thinking back to those two penalties that Australia turned down in the opening quarter. O’Connor could have slotted either to make it 13-10 to the Boks. Instead they went to the corner and twice came away with nothing around the 20 minute mark. Rugby doesn’t quite work like this but if we can imagine both kicks going over we might be considering a different outcome. Worth noting that James O’Connor missed three kicks worth eight points in a game lost by as many. I’m not saying that is the reason they lost. I’m also not not saying it. South Africa deserve that. I think that’s fair to say. Not just because Pollard kicked all six of his shots at goal but because on balance they won the breakdown battle, owned the skies and got the edge at the point of contact. Australia were brilliant. Again. This is a proper rugby team. Their work around the fringe is something else and they proved that they can play fast and loose as well as tight and scrappy. They can’t stick the landing. The line-out is a mess and the subsequent attack off sloppy ball fizzled out. No matter. South Africa win a tense battle. Three tries apiece but Handre Pollard’s boot was the difference. Not the prettiest game. But that was cracking Test footy. That’s a commendable loss for the Wallabies who’ll leave South Africa with credit in the bank. 80 min: Another review. There’s a neck-roll on de Jager so Handre Pollard hoofs a kick to the corner. Another try would see them win a bonus point. They’ll set the maul. Can they do it? 80 min: South Africa come away with the ball. There’s an Australian knock-on. South Africa try to counter off the loose ball but can’t. We come back for the scrum. The game is won. They simply need to win the scrum, kick it out and take the W. 80 min: O’Connor doesn’t have the legs! That’s three misses in a row for the Wallaby 10. He’s nailed for a deliberate knock-on. Hard to argue. Ans with Australians outside him he had to go. O’Connor points to the poles again. He’s on halfway. Right in front. So a 50 metre shot to win a bonus point. 78 min: O’Connor misses! He starts it right of the poles and can’t bring it back round. That’s two kicks missed in a row for the Aussies. Van der Merwe of the Scarletts comes on to replace Marx at hooker. 77 min: Kolbe with a steal inside his own 22! Brilliant from the little winger who has been immense! Australia ground their way deep into South Africa’s territory. Slick hands from a few of them opened space for Jorgensen down the right. But Kolbe stole in and won the ball. OH! There’s a high tackle against Feinberg-Mngomezulu after review. So the penalty switches hands. Australia need to score twice so perhaps they take the kickable points from here. Even if they don’t win they might take a losing bonus point if O’Connor slots it from the right about 35 metres out on the angle. Eben stretches and gets there! South Africa won the scrum penalty so they had freedom to attack inside the Aussie’s 22. They went right with Kriel making ground. Then they went left where Venter charged. They came close twice. Reinach stretched and couldn’t get there before Etzebeth’s extra length proved the difference from close range. Relentless and aggressive. Pollard’s two more points makes it an eight point game. Australia need to score twice to rescue this. 72 min: Kellaway drops the ball inside his own 22! This is a huge opportunity for the Springboks. It came as a result of Feinberg-Mngomezulu wriggling some space down the right tram inside his own half. He passed for Reinach who hoofed a kick into space. Australia mopped up through Jorgensen who flung a pass for Kellaway. But the replacement 15 spilled it and now the Boks have a great set with space either side. 70 min: This is tense! South Africa spark a counter through Kolbe. It goes down the line and slick hands from the prop Louw means they find an edge around the Australian rush defence. Pollard to de Allende to Kriel. The final pass to Fassi is a tough one and the full-back/winger can’t keep it in play. Oh, ignore all that. We’re coming back to the opposite wing as Feinberg-Mngomezulu’s foot was out as he collected McDermott’s box kick. Line out for Australia just inside their own half. Australia within a point! And they’ve done it by beating the Boks at their own game. Simple rugby. Line-out goes to the middle and the hooker, Paenga-Amosa, joins the morass and manages to worm his way between the two Springboks defensive pods. It’s scrappy but it’s over. O’Connor misses a very gettable kick. How costly will that be? 67 min: Australia are keeping it tight off the line-out. Ikitau runs a wonderful blind line and makes ground. So does Valetini. Etzebeth gives away a penalty. The Aussies are hammering the fringe with short runs off McDermott’s accurate passing. Lovely stuff. They don’t breach the line but have the penalty. No points. They go for the corner and a line-out. Esterhuizen comes on at last and replaces Mostert. So that’s an inside centre playing on the flank. 65 min: South Africa look to put a second shove on Bell but the Aussie holds his own and stays on his feet. So Reinach picks it up and has time to kick a clearing kick towards halfway. Paenga-Amosa is on for Billy Pollard and finds his jumper with his first throw. 64 min: Kriel is still on the field. So why is Nche captaining? Anyway, McDermott off the scrum kicks. South Africa return the favour, get it back and then kick again. Ikitau gets the ball and Toole has it. He’s cantering up field. Chips ahead. This is sensational! Australia are metres out. Toole is rapid! But the Boks scramble and make the tackle and then turn the ball over under the shade of their own poles. Phew! What a let off for the Boks. That was Handre Pollard rushing back. The chip ahead from Toole bounced the wrong way as far as he was concerned. Could have been a 75 metre score. It ends with a Boks scrum deep in their own patch. 61 min: Billy Pollard’s throw is long and Mostert snaffles it on the floor. South Africa flood forward. They’re up to Australia’s 22. There are three spills of the ball. Referee Doleman says they’re all backwards but changes his mind on one from Nche that seemed to go forward. Scrum to the Wallabies on their own 22. Kriel is off the pitch (for Esterhuizen I’m guessing) so Nnche is skipper. Reinach replaces Williams at 9. 58 min: Jorgensen plucks a stunning catch under pressure on his right wing. That wins the ball back for the Wallabies after some sustained pressure from the Boks. Australia are on their own 22 line where McDermott hoofs a box kick. Feinberg-Mngomezulu gathers the bouncing before. He tries to unfurl an off-load back infield but it bobbles out for a Wallaby throw. Pollard has five from five. The Ice Man coming up with the goods yet again. 56 min: South Africa drop the ball off the back of a line-out but they get lucky. Ikitau is nailed for straying off-side in midfield. He looks befuddled. Handre Pollard points to the sticks. About 40 metres out pretty much in front. 55 min: Both teams are going to the boot. The ground is tearing up and things are getting slippery. A bout of kick tennis ends with thew Boks on the ball inside Australia’s half. Pollard tries a dink to the right wing for Moodie to chase, but it’s too flat and too long so Toole catches and takes the mark. Moodie, after dropping the ball twice, is off for the talented Feinberg-Mngomezulu. The new man will go to fullback with Fassi going to the left win. Kolbe shifts across the right. 52 min: Moodie knock-on again! How frustrating. South Africa were forming an attack following a McDermott clearing kick. They had numbers down the right after winning a couple of breakdowns on attack (remember that was their main issue last week). But the lanky winger couldn’t hold onto the greasy pill. Another scrum for the Wallabies who have Bell on the pitch. 50 min: South Africa get through six phases after the line-out. They’re direct. Etzebeth and de Allende make some meaty carries. De Jager as well. They’re going back to basics and are making great ground. But they go one run too many with Etzebeth spilling in contact. Solid defence from the Aussies. Scrum to the men in gold inside their 22 in front of the poles. 49 min: It’s a ding-dong affair after the restart. Toole wins the ball on the wing but it’s back in the other tram in a flash with Kolbe hoisting a high kick which he chases. Jorgensen wins it but is clattered. From there it’s scrappy near the touchline and the ball spills out for a South African throw. The Aussies strike first! Off the scrum, O’Connor takes it flat and puts in a diagonal kick that has Moodie scrambling in the back field. The South African winger made a right mess of the bouncing ball which gave Jorgensen the chance to steal in and complete an easy score. Is the comeback on? It’s a three point game thanks to an extra two from O’Connor’s boot. 44 min: Solid with ball in hand from the Aussies. They get the ball back on their side after Kolbe knocked on a high kick. South Africa owned the skies in the first set but this goes the Aussies way. They go down the line until they run out of road on the left. It ends with a Saffa line-out. A high clearing kick following the throw ends with a South African hand spilling a loose ball. The Boks make a double change in the second row. De Jager and Etzebeth replace Snyman and Nortje. 43 min: Nche swims through the Aussie maul and wins the ball. South Africa now have an attacking set inside the Wallabies 22. But de Allende gets in a muddle in midfield and van Staden overruns his support line. They criss-cross and Australia get a soft penalty and a chance to exit. 42 min: South Africa win the ball out the scrum and go down the line. Fassi rakes a grubber to the corner. Finds touch. Australia will have the line-out inside their 22. 41 min: That’s a poor start from Edmed. His first job is to get the game going again and he hoofs the kick long. South Africa get the scrum on halfway and will no doubt look to force a penalty. Correction, O’Connor is still on the field. It’s Suaalii who has been repalced. HIA. We may see him again. We’re back. There’s a change at half-time for the Wallabies with 25-year-old Tane Edmond coming on. I think he’s replaced James O’Connor. I’d say that’s close to a fair reflection of the contest but Australia might argue against that. They had a try disallowed and did most of the running. They were the first to cross the whitewash after two Pollard penalties but South Africa dotted down twice. It’s been direct and confrontational. It’s not been a classic but plenty to enjoy. Back in a bit. As the siren sounds O’Connor nails the penalty. That’s a good kick on the angle towards the right. 40 min: Australia keep the ball off the line-out but don’t do much with it. Skelton with some big carries. It’s a little aimless. They spill the ball in contact which gives Smith a chance to steal it, but he goes at just the wrong time and coughs up a soft penalty. This time O’Connor points to the poles and a shot at points before the half-time break. 38 min: South Africa secure the restart and after a few kick exchanges Fassi hoists a high left footer that he scampers after. It’s overcooked which means the Wallabies will have the throw inside South Africa’s half from whence it came. Kwagga through the guts! Direct, robust, South Africa at their best. Clean line-out on the 22 means it’s front-foot ball for Williams. Kriel with a big carry opened a hole and Smith, off the base of the pack, gathered, shook off one tackler, shrugged off another and slid over under the poles. Pollard clips the easy extras. Much better from South Africa. 33 min: Neither side can keep the ball but it’s fascinating viewing. Tupou knocks on and South Africa counter. Smith makea ground before Valetini nails him. Then they kick and Australia return a kick. Fassi has it and dinks an up and under for himself. He gathers, steps a defender and feeds Nortje who is charging up field. South Africa are on the edge of the Australian 22 when they spill the ball in contact. Australia come away with it and kick. It ends with a Saffa line-out on Australia’s 22 towards the right. helter skelter stuff. Loving this. 31 min: Australia win a breakdown penalty. Or should that be South Africa give away a soft one. Van Staden goes to clean the ruck inside the Wallabies’ 22 but loses his feet and is pinged. Also from the side. Good defence from the Aussies who are cohesive. The Boks are struggling to find cracks in the line. 29 min: South Africa win the line-out. They’re struggling to get for-forward though with ball in hand. De Allende chooses to cross kick looking for Moodie but it’s a little long and goes out (but not before Moodie himself volleyed it straight out). W We’re coming back for a high hit on Kolbe. Hooper the guilty party I think so South Africa get the penalty which is kicked out on Australia’s 22. 28 min: South Africa get clean ball off the scrum. Twice they go to the air for their wingers to chase. Kolbe wins it on the left. Moodie wins it on the right but spills it as he lands. Skelton almost sacked Handre Pollard. The Boks fly-half must have had the fright of his life as the monster lock suddenly loomed in front of him. Anyway, Australia’s scrum on the left inside their own half. They win the ball and Toole, off his wing, rakes a kick looking for a 50-22. It doesn’t quite land but it does find touch, pinning the Saffas inside their own half and forcing Marx to throw just beyond his 22. 25 min: A little sloppy from both teams. Now it’s Australia’s turn to make a mistake at the line-out. Billy Pollard throws skew. Nortje was lifted to challenge which means South Africa get the ball back with a scrum feed on their own 22. 24 min: One step forward, two steps back for South Africa. After that important steal on the ground they give away a soft penalty at the line-out inside Australia’s half. Nortje disrupting the lifter in the air. So Australia will come again with a penalty kicked out inside their patch. Another good opportunity for the Wallabies to launch an attack from South Africa’s patch. 23 min: Marx disrupts the Aussie maul after some good ground gained by Skelton and co and that creates the fracture. Du Toit spots the ball and steps forward to pinch it. A great result for the Boks. They win the ball, spiral it down the line before Kolbe hoofs it long. 22 min: Australia win the scrum and keep it tight. They hammer the blind side. Valetini hammers de Allende with a stiff carry. They keep it narrow before Smith gives away a penalty on the ground. Robust stuff from the Aussies who are prepared to face up to the bully Boks. Again they turn down the points and hoof to the corner. They’ll fancy themselves either with a maul or some more short carries around the fringe. It’s all Australia for the past 10 minutes. 20 min: South Africa cough the ball up at the line-out and give away a scrum inside their own half. Skelton causing Snyman problems. Another chance for the Wallabies to launch an attacking set from the left. 19 min: Australia win an uncontested ball off the top of the line-out but quick line speed from the Boks defence forces them back beyond the 22. Australia go through the phases despite going backwards. McDermott spots a gap and makes good ground after a snipe around the fringe but he’s isolated and van Staden gets in to steal the ball once the Aussie scrum-half is tackled. That’s a good penalty win for South Africa who were bossed at the breakdown last week. 16 min: Pollard’s clearing kick doesn’t go very far so the Wallabies get a line-out just beyond South Africa’s 22. They go off the top with Pollard on the wraparound. Valetini carries before van Staden slows the ball down as McDermott goes for it. Rather than kick for poles Australia go to the corner. 13 min: TRY CHALKED OFF! Wow, McReight thought he’d scored after pouncing on a loose ball following a brilliant break down the right from Kellaway. Pollard collected the grubber ahead but was nailed by Kellaway. The ball spilled towards the SA try line and McReight fell onto it and celebrated. But replays show that Kellaway’s hand tipped it on as he made the tackle on Pollard. Australia are so dangerous from broken play. That is a let off for the Boks. It all ends with a scrum for South Africa inside their own 22 all the way on the left. The Boks bounce back! Moodie collects a rakiing cross-kick from coast to coast from Pollard. He catches after it bounces and steps infield to dot down. It started with a high kick from Williams that was grabbed by White. But Smith on onto him in a flash and flung him down onto the turf. The Boks swarmed and stole the turnover. Du Toit and Snyman cam close with close carries before Pollard kicked to the right wing where Moodie finished it off. White is off with an HIA after hammering the turf from that rag-doll tackle as Pollard adds the extras from the tee. 10 min: Whie and O’Connor are dovetailing beautifully. From the restart White dummies a kick and feeds O’Connor who hammers a clearing boot. Slick from the men in gold. TRY ON DEBUT! Sharp from White who puts it on a place for the sevens star. Du Toit went early on the scrum so the Wallabies got the freekick. White spotted the space down the blind on the left and tapped and kicked a grubber. Toole cantered onto the bouncing ball, gathered and slid over. O’Connor slots the conversion from the left tram and the Wallabies are in front. 7 min: Smith gathers his second restart. He had troubles from kick-offs in the past but he’s secure once again. A Williams high kick is knocked on by a man in green but the Wallabies can’t counter as Tupou flings a wild pass that is knocked on. Australia’s scrum inside South Africa’s half between halfway and the 22. Pollard doubles the lead. Slightly wider and further away than the last one, but that’s no problem for the sharpshooter. Two entries into Australia’s 22. Two exits with points on the board. 5 min: The Boks get a second shove at the scrum and win a penalty. Williams picks up and delays a pass back against the grain for Fassi running on from fullback. He kicks to the corner for the onrushing Kolbe. Was he taken out off the ball? No says the ref. But we’ll come back for a penalty that Pollard will aim at the poles. 4 min: South Africa clear from the scrum and Wright in the backfield dallies. The rush defence is on him in a flash and he plays a reckless pass that is knocked on by Suiaalii. Wright goes down in a heap. Is that an ACL? Doesn’t look good for the fullback. The Boks will have a scrum inside Australia’s patch but the bigger worry is the health of Wright’s knee. Have they switched him out? Yes they have. Kellaway on the pitch. Wright looks despondent. 3 min: A short restart from the Wallabies is chased by debutant Toole, but Wiese beats him to it and the Boks secure the ball. They’ll have a scrum on their own 22. Pollard doesn’t miss from there. Just to the right, just outside the 22. A swing of the boot and the Boks take an early lead. 2 min: White kicks a high box that Fassi gathers on the leap. Pollard returns a kick but Wright has it comfortably. The Boks swarm the breakdown and win a penalty on the floor just outside the Wallabies’ 22. Slight angle, well within range for Pollard. Kriel points to the sticks. The anthems are done. The pitch looks a picture. The two sets of players are snarling and flashing their fangs. Referee James Doleman from New Zealand blows his whistle, Handre Pollard kicks off and we’re away! Australia haven’t won consecutive Tests in South Africa since 1963. As the Impi warriors run out an the fireworks are set off, this feels like it could be an epic day. History beckons. I cannot wait! Big news that I missed! Willie le Roux is out. Aphelele Fassi is in at full-back! Australia haven’t beaten South Africa in back-to-back games since 2015. Tell you what, I think they’ll do it. It’s been raining in Cape Town so the ball might be slipper early on. The sun is coming out but the weather in Cape Town is temperamental at best. Could be a factor throughout the contest. While you chew over the Boks’ problems in the back row, why not take a gender at some fine writing: Our man Angus Fontaine is in bullish spirits as he backs the Wallabies to do the double: Andy Bull was in Sunderland watching women’s rugby reach stratospheric levels last night: Sarah Rendell was also up north, reporting on an England rout: And Aaron Bower was on hand to watch the Wallaroos put Samoa to the sword: An intersting point shared on X by South African commentator AP Cronje: “I would honestly rather they just start Andre at 8 and have Kwagga come off the bench. Maybe Marco [van Staden] will play 8 and Kwagga will be 6 - which is marginally better than the other way around. Either way we have problems. Pack severely lacking in momentum givers.” I worry for the Springboks. Not often you look at the back row and think they’re short of grunt but with Kwagga Smith (at 8) and Franco Mostert (at 7) playing out of position, you must be worried too if you’re a South African support. Valetini, Hooper and McReight will be licking their lips at the prospect of yet again commanding their sphere of influence. We’ve got our first email of the afternoon and it’s from a gem, Darryl Accone, looking for an old school chum: Hi Daniel, Back in 1969 the Wallabies lost all four Tests of the series to the Springboks. As a nine year old at the time, from an Eurasian family classified as “non-White” by the apartheid government of the day, my support went to the Australians. Only one other boy in our private school was rooting for the Wallabies: Adrian Robertson, son of the Australian ambassador to South Africa. If Adrian’s out there reading this, I have to say my allegiances have changed, mate, but it was so good to stand with you then. Ciao. The curse of the Boks No 8 continues. Jasper Wiese is suspended after being injured for some time. Elrigh Louw, Cameron Hannekom, Juarno Augustus and Siya Kolisi are all on the phsyio’s table. That means that Andre Esterhuizen, a centre by trade, has been called onto the bench. Don’t be surprised if you see him pack down at flank. Kwagga Smith starts, making that back row look quite light all of a sudden. Worrying for the Boks. The return of Rob Valetini adds heft and dynamism to an already accomplished back row. There’s also a debut for Corey Toole who starts on the wing. The 25-year-old has already had a taste of the big time having played in the Paris Olympics, but this will be a different challenge for the sevens ace. Skipper Harry Hilson is out with a knee niggle so the breakdown king Fraser McReight captains. James Slipper also misses out having failed to recover from a head knock and is replaced by Tom Robertson in the front row. Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt said the side had recovered well after the physical encounter at altitude and had identified their slow start – trailing 22-0 – as an area they needed to improve. “The squad as a whole has recovered pretty well from what was a very draining and physical Test match on the highveld last week,” he said in a statement. “We struggled to contain a powerhouse Springbok start last weekend and we know that we have to improve leading into what’s likely to be a bruising encounter in Cape Town.” Wallabies: Tom Wright; Max Jorgensen, Joseph Suaalii, Len Ikitau, Corey Toole; James O’Connor, Nic White; Tom Robertson, Billy Pollard, Taniela Tupou, Nick Frost, Will Skelton, Tom Hooper, Fraser McReight (c), Rob Valetini. Replacements: Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Angus Bell, Zane Nonggorr, Jeremy Williams, Nick Champion de Crespigny, Tane Edmed, Tate McDermott, Andrew Kellaway. Out with the flash, in with the grit. It’s not as simple as that, or is it? Manie Libbok’s razzle-dazzle has been shelved for the more pragmatic Handre Pollard at fly-half. The Boks have all but telegraphed that they will play a route one game today. Expect runners off short passes, pods of forwards battering the line and big meaty hits around the fringe. If they earn the right to go wide the returning Cheslin Kolbe will be ready to pounce. There’s a late change: Jean-Luc du Preez was meant to start at no. 8. He’s unwell which means Kwagga Smith slots in at the base of the pack. Andre Esterhuizen is now on the bench. And another! Aphelele Fassi comes from the cold to replace Willie le Roux at 15. (Cards on the table, this wasn’t a late change. It was in fact announced yesterday. I just missed it. Apologies) Springboks: Aphelele Fassi; Canan Moodie, Jesse Kriel (c), Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe; Handre Pollard, Grant Williams; Ox Nche, Malcolm Marx, Thomas du Toit, RG Snyman, Ruan Nortje, Marco van Staden, Franco Mostert, Kwagga Smith. Replacements: Marnus van der Merwe, Boan Venter, Wilco Louw, Eben Etzebeth, Lood de Jager, Andre Esterhuizen, Cobus Reinach, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu. In the immortal words of Woody Harrelson’s Tallahassee, it’s time to nut up or shut up. For South Africa’s Springboks who must now dispel all talk of a dynasty in decline. Who must prove that their all-conquering champions are still a force to be reckoned with. For Australia’s Wallabies who must now hammer down on their gains. Who must now prove that their heroes in gold are a team on the rise. Last week defied expectations. From 22-0 down Australia roared back to claim a 38-22 win. Remarkable. Sensational. Bewildering. Take your pick. None of them will do it justice. Don’t expect a freewheeling Boks today. Rassie Erasmus has promised to bring the thunder with good old fashioned Saffa rugby. They’ll be direct. They’ll be aggressive. They will do whatever they can to deny the Wallabies loose forwards opportunity to boss the breakdown once again. Can they do it? Or will wily Joe Schmidt orchestrate another heist? We’ll find out together. Kick-off at 5:10 pm local time, 4:10 pm in the UK and 0:10 am AEST. Teams and other bits to come.
