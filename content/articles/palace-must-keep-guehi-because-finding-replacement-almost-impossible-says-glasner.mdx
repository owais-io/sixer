  Oliver Glasner has made clear that Crystal Palace must not sell Marc Guéhi
  before Monday’s transfer deadline because finding a replacement for the
  England defender will be “almost impossible”. Palace, who confirmed the
  signing of Spain forward Yeremy Pino from Villarreal on Friday, have agreed a
  fee worth up to €27m (£23.4m) with Toulouse for Jaydee Canvot, with the France
  Under-20 defender expected to sign a five-year contract. Palace have been
  desperate to add defensive reinforcements amid uncertainty over Guéhi’s future
  and Canvot is seen as a player with huge potential having made his
  breakthrough in Ligue 1 last season. But the FA Cup winners have been
  frustrated so far in their attempts to find a more experienced option. They
  have approached Manchester City over a deal for Manuel Akanji but the
  Switzerland defender has interest from Milan and Spurs so looks likely to move
  elsewhere, while Palace have also made inquiries about taking Mohammed Salisu
  on loan from Monaco. Liverpool have yet to meet Palace’s £40m valuation for
  Guéhi, who has one year on his contract, and Glasner wants him to stay. “From
  my side, he has to [still be a Crystal Palace player] because it’s not
  possible at the moment to find a Marc Guéhi replacement who can play straight
  in the Premier League, being a starter, being consistent,” said the Palace
  manager. Palace are in the market for more attacking reinforcements. They have
  had an approach for David Brooks turned down by Bournemouth and could follow
  up interest in Christoph Baumgartner of RB Leipzig.
