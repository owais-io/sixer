  Going to waste: two years after REDcycle’s collapse, Australia’s soft plastics
  are hitting the environment hard

  Two years on from REDcycle’s collapse, 94% of Australia’s soft plastics are
  still headed for landfill. Collection has restarted at supermarkets, and 42
  warehouses of plastics have been cleared, but experts say the packaging
  industry must take responsibility for the mess. By July, supermarkets had
  mostly cleared the stockpiles, which by November 2022 reached 11,000 tonnes of
  soft plastics at 44 sites across the country, hoards accumulated as
  collections outstripped available recycling capacity and export restrictions
  increased the amount of plastic waste in Australia. The remainder – 3,500
  tonnes at two sites, in Victoria and in South Australia – is due to be
  processed in the first half of 2026, according to the supermarket members of
  the Soft Plastics Taskforce. But as more than 100 new collection points have
  been rolled out since June in selected Woolworths, Coles and Aldi stores
  across New South Wales and Victoria, taskforce members have been careful not
  to collect more than can be processed. “The biggest challenge still remains
  that there is simply not enough soft plastic recycling capacity in Australia
  to support full, nationwide collections,” a spokesperson for the taskforce
  told the Guardian. Soft plastic is defined by its ability to be scrunched into
  a ball, unlike “rigid” plastics, which are moulded to hold their shape. Even
  at the peak of its operations in 2022, REDcycle was collecting about 7,500
  tonnes – less than 2% of the 538,000 tonnes of plastic bags, food wrappers,
  bubble wrap and other “flexible” plastic waste produced in Australia each
  year. “We still have a real problem in that we consume too much [soft
  plastics], we discard too much and we don’t buy back anywhere near enough,”
  says Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of the Waste Management and Resource
  Recovery Association of Australia. While recyclers are increasing their
  capacity to process the material, Sloan says other problems remain: the vast
  quantities produced, design packaging that is too complex to recover and the
  lack of demand from packaging companies and other consumers for
  Australian-made recycled plastic. She says the onus should be on plastic
  manufacturers to invest in facilities to take back their own material. “We’ve
  got to stop putting it on consumers to solve the problem.” Despite national
  packaging targets set by governments in 2018 for 70% of plastic packaging to
  be recycled by 2025, only about 6% of used and discarded soft plastics were
  being baled, sorted, shredded, washed, melted – or chemically processed – and
  turned into new products, according to data published in December by Soft
  Plastics Stewardship Australia. The rest has headed to landfill. Consumer
  plastics collected by households, while the most visible, are only one part of
  the story. Soft plastics are embedded in so many aspects of modern life, says
  David Hodge, the managing director of recycling company Plastic Forests. The
  material is widely used, for example, in sectors such as agriculture for
  storing grain and preventing weeds, and in transport for wrapping pallets.
  Consumer materials, particularly those used for foods – frozen produce bags,
  cereal liners or bread bags – are “tremendously hard to recycle, some of them
  impossible”, he says. They are often “super technical”, comprising different
  types of plastic, and contaminated by inks used for advertising, or food
  residues. While there is value for recyclers in processing plastics, such as
  PET (or polyethylene terephthalate) in drink bottles collected in container
  deposit schemes, Hodge says “the economics is broken in soft plastics” because
  the energy, labor and transport required to collect, process and recycle them
  costs more than importing new materials. The lack of incentives or mandates
  for products made from recycled content – such as fence posts and garden
  edging, electrical cable cover and plastic sheeting – mean they often
  struggled to compete with non-recycled products. “There has to be support for
  the purchase of products. That will create the pull through,” Hodge says.
  “Bunnings needs to be given a federal government mandate to support Australian
  made recycled products,” he says as an example. Jennifer Macklin, a researcher
  at Monash University’s Sustainable Development Institute, says the solutions
  to the soft plastics problem are similar to other material and waste
  challenges. They include designing plastic packaging so it can be more easily
  recycled (while retaining its function, such as keeping food fresh),
  developing recycling infrastructure capable of turning large volumes of soft
  plastic waste into a usable material and – crucially – reinforcing demand for
  the recovered material. “That’s the big chicken and egg that we have with
  recycling,” Macklin says. “We’re quite good at collecting and reprocessing but
  not very good at buying it to turn it into new things.” Consumers have a role
  to play, she says, but as a general principle producers and importers of
  plastics should be responsible for the material’s entire lifecycle. In late
  2024, the federal government consulted on options for reforming plastic
  packaging. According to its summary, 80% of stakeholders supported regulation,
  and 65% supported an extended responsibility scheme that would make plastics
  producers responsible for the entire product lifecycle. The government is now
  “working with industry and state and territory governments to deliver
  fit-for-purpose packaging regulations as part of Australia’s transition to a
  circular economy”, a departmental spokesperson said. Sloan says voluntary
  approaches have failed. “We need to have clear design standards and they need
  to be enforceable, and we actually need those who make this to be held
  accountable and invest in facilities to take it back,” she says. “We’ve got to
  stop putting products out on the market that have no home and can’t be
  recovered.”
