  Last year, amid partisan debate over international student numbers,
  Universities Australia accused both sides of parliament of using the tertiary
  sector as a “political plaything”. Fast forward to 2025, and the federal
  government has back flipped on its plan to cap foreign student entries,
  announcing last week that it would increase places by 25,000 next year. The
  opposition has also said it will adopt a more “sensitive approach”. So was the
  election campaign rhetoric just hot air? And will the cap ever be revived?
  What’s changing with the number of international students? From next year, the
  international education sector will be allowed to grow by 25,000 additional
  places compared with 2025 and all providers will receive at least their
  current allocation of students. After the commonwealth’s proposed
  international student cap – which would have limited new enrolments in 2025 to
  270,000 – failed to receive Coalition backing, the National Planning Level for
  2026 was set at 295,000 international places. The education department said
  that was 8% below the post-Covid peak in 2023, and that international student
  levels for 2025 were “broadly on track” for the current planning level of
  270,000s. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Public universities will be able to
  push for higher individual allocations by demonstrating “increased engagement”
  with Southeast Asia, in line with the government’s priority to “deepen
  engagement in our region”, or by providing additional student accommodation
  (the initial purpose of the proposed cap was to free-up housing).
  “Strategically important” cohorts including Pacific and Timor-Leste students
  and scholarship holders will continue to receive high-priority visa
  processing, and some students, including those moving from Tafe institutes to
  public universities, will be exempt from the planning level. The minister for
  home affairs, Tony Burke, said the changes would ensure student visa
  processing supported “genuine education outcomes” and strategic priorities.
  “This is about backing providers who do the right things and giving them the
  certainty they need to grow sustainably,” he said. How did the international
  student system work before? The federal government replaced its failed
  international student cap by slowing visa processing, a move the former deputy
  immigration secretary described as “political point scoring”. The new
  Ministerial Direction 111 (MD111), rolled out in late 2024 introduced two
  categories of student visa processing: “high priority” and “standard
  priority”, instead of capping numbers. All international providers received
  high priority processing up to 80% of their indicative cap, with slower
  processing after this. Prior to that, Ministerial Direction 107 (MD107) was
  employed as an arbitrary cap that gave visa processing priority to “low risk”
  sandstone universities and students from “low risk” nations,
  disproportionately affecting applicants from south Asia and regional
  universities. The education department said MD111 would be replaced with an
  updated ministerial direction later in 2025 to “manage student visa
  prioritisation in line with the 2026 allocations”. It will continue the
  principles of MD111. Is this a long-term solution to the international
  education system? The international education sector will be continue to be
  heavily regulated by the government. From 2027, the new Australian Tertiary
  Education Commission will manage higher education growth, subject to
  legislation passing, indicating there will not be a shift back to a market-led
  approach. For the international Vet sector from 2027, the federal government
  will continue to use visa processing and integrity reforms to direct the
  proportion of international students. The education minister, Jason Clare,
  said the sector was an “incredibly important export industry” that had to be
  expanded sustainably. “The new planning level gives the sector certainty to
  continue delivering a high-quality educational experience to international
  students, while addressing national priorities.” The next step is for the
  government to meet its 2026 target. Andrew Norton, a higher education policy
  professor at Monash University, said that despite the modest reforms, other
  migration policies in place to block or deter international students could
  mean the actual number falls short of 295,000. Norton noted in the
  Conversation that the successive migration policies had particularly decimated
  offshore demand for vocational education, which dropped by 75% in the first
  six months of 2025 compared with 2023. How has the international education
  sector reacted? After consistently calling for growth in the international
  student market, Universities Australia’s chief executive officer, Luke Sheehy,
  said the government’s approach was “sensible” and would provide “stability and
  certainty”. “We’ll continue to work constructively with the government to
  strengthen the integrity of the sector, including the design of a new
  ministerial direction,” Sheehy said. International students have welcomed the
  changes, but say the government needs to go further to lure students back.
  International officer at the Council of Australian Postgraduate Associations
  (CAPA), Weihong Liang, said international education needed a “reset” towards
  student welfare and support, “instead of the constant rhetoric around the
  revenue they bring in”. He pointed out international student visa fees almost
  tripled since 2023, from $710 to $2,000 – and not were not directed towards
  university services or funding for accommodation. “Experiences of perceived
  unfair treatment have lasting impacts, potentially affecting Australia’s
  international relationships, educational partnerships and economic
  opportunities far into the future,” Liang said. Are Australia’s international
  student wars over? Deputy Greens leader and higher education spokesperson,
  Senator Mehreen Faruqi, said during the election campaign that international
  students had been used as a “political football”. “Blaming international
  students for the housing crisis was pure racist dog-whistling and a far cry
  from reality,” she said. “Australia’s reputation was trashed by Labor’s
  politically motivated international student caps and high visa fees, with
  students turning away and university rankings declining. “Now Labor is trying
  to crawl back on their reckless international student caps but still without a
  rationale or a long-term plan to address [this] crisis.” The Coalition has
  also toned down its messaging. The opposition’s education spokesperson,
  Jonathon Duniam, walked away from his party’s call for Australia to slash
  80,000 international student places, promising a more “sensitive” approach
  this term. He said tertiary providers needed clarity on how the target was
  chosen, “while ensuring that there are no losers”. “Regional universities and
  high-quality specialist providers should not be swept up in a
  one-size-fits-all approach,” he said. “We will work with the tertiary sector
  to get this right.”
