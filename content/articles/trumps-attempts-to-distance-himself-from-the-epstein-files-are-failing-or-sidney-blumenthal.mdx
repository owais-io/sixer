  One of Trump’s preternatural abilities is his apparent animal instinct to lie
  on the spot whenever he senses he might be cornered. His initial Pavlovian
  training by his mob lawyer Roy Cohn and subsequent experience in more than
  4,000 lawsuits and countless scandals seem to have ingrained in him that
  lying, the more outrageous the better, buys him time, plays to his credulous
  followers as insouciant defiance, and wears down his accusers. When Trump’s
  distractions failed to distract from the Jeffrey Epstein files, he offered a
  story without missing a beat to distance himself from any taint. In his tale,
  he was traduced by Epstein. Trump was taken advantage of, violated, despoiled.
  There could be no guilt by association; Trump was a victim, too. Perhaps,
  after claiming to no effect that Barack Obama, Joe Biden and the former FBI
  director James Comey had fabricated the files, he felt that he had at last
  found ground where he could gain some traction. Trump always designates a
  scapegoat, but neither Tren de Agua nor Hunter Biden would fit with Epstein.
  All along, Trump has missed the easiest and most obvious scapegoat. Why not
  blame Epstein for Epstein? Trump just needed to invent a story. He began by
  blurting on 28 July: “But for years, I wouldn’t talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I
  wouldn’t talk because he did something that was inappropriate. He hired help,
  and I said, ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ He stole people that worked for me. I
  said, ‘Don’t ever do that again.’ He did it again. And I threw him out of the
  place – persona non grata. I threw him out, and that was it. I’m glad I did,
  if you want to know the truth.” After establishing the premise of his story,
  he added more detail the next day. “People that work in the spa – I have a
  great spa, one of the best spas in the world at Mar-a-Lago – and people were
  taken out of the spa, hired by him. In other words, gone. And other people
  would come and complain, ‘This guy is taking people from the spa.’ I didn’t
  know that. He took people that worked for me. And I told him, ‘Don’t do it any
  more.’ And he did it. I said, ‘Stay the hell out of here.’” A reporter
  followed up to ask if any of those employees were young women, an opportunity
  for further Trump story enhancement. “The answer is yes, they were in the
  spa,” Trump said. “I told him, I said, ‘Listen, we don’t want you taking our
  people, whether it was spa or not spa’ … And he was fine. And then not too
  long after that, he did it again.” Then Trump was asked if one of those young
  women was Virginia Giuffre, who was exploited by Epstein beginning at age 16
  in 2000 until she escaped his clutches in 2002, eventually filing lawsuits
  against him that helped break the case open. “I think she worked at the spa,”
  Trump replied. “I think that was one of the people, yeah. He stole her.” He
  added, “And by the way, she had no complaints about us, as you know – none
  whatsoever.” Trump’s self-defensive remarks were an accumulation of lies and
  distortions, each one at risk of tumbling on the next. Unfortunately, it was
  contradicted by the factual timeline. And his comments about Giuffre, the
  tragically abused child who bore witness, for whom he offered not a word of
  sympathy, depicting her as stolen property, offended the Giuffre family, who
  came forward to denounce his heartlessness. “It was shocking to hear President
  Trump invoke our sister and say that he was aware that Virginia had been
  ‘stolen’ from Mar-a-Lago,” read the family’s statement. This was not the
  public relations success that Trump had hoped for to lay the Epstein scandal
  to rest. Trump suggested in his story that Giuffre was only one of the
  “people” Epstein had poached from him. In his telling, he first warned Epstein
  before he “stole” Giuffre. In fact, it was Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former
  girlfriend and accomplice, who recruited Giuffre and participated in her
  sexual abuse. There is no record of others than Giuffre recruited from the
  Mar-a-Lago spa. Trump’s story of multiple “people” and his warning to Epstein
  are baseless. Still, the ever reliable White House press secretary Karoline
  Leavitt stated: “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein
  out of his club for being a creep to his female employees.” Trump went on
  Newsmax to praise her, the press secretary, as if she were the winner of a
  modeling contest: “She’s become a star. It’s that face, it’s that brain, it’s
  those lips, the way they move, they move like she’s a machine gun.” It was
  true Trump had not spoken “for years” to Epstein. But there his truthfulness
  ended. Three years after Trump claimed he had cut his ties to Epstein for
  stealing Giuffre, in 2003, Trump sent him a risqué poem celebrating his 50th
  birthday inside his drawing of a naked woman, signing his name to represent
  pubic hair, according to the Wall Street Journal. “We have certain things in
  common, Jeffrey … A pal is a wonderful thing … and may every day be a
  wonderful secret.” According to the Washington Post, their relationship
  ruptured not in 2000 as Trump claimed, but in 2004 over a real estate rivalry
  to purchase a Palm Beach estate. Trump, whose casinos went bankrupt that year,
  somehow found the cash to outbid Epstein. Four years later, Trump sold the
  estate to a Russian oligarch closely tied to Vladimir Putin for double the
  price, at $95m. “Don’t say Russian,” Trump told a reporter from the Palm Beach
  Post. He urged the reporter just to write “foreign”. Trump and Epstein
  socialized together for years with “young women”, some underage, and often
  with models, including a party for “calendar girls” at Mar-a-Lago in 1992,
  where the two were the only other guests, and Trump’s alleged groping of the
  model Stacey Williams in Trump Tower with Epstein present in 1993. Trump
  denies these allegations. “Epstein enjoyed hanging out backstage at beauty
  pageants and fashion shows with his Palm Beach and New York neighbor and
  friend Donald Trump, former models said,” the Miami Herald reported. Trump
  himself owned three beauty pageants. He described going backstage on the
  Howard Stern radio talk show in 2005: “You know they’re standing there with no
  clothes … And you see these incredible looking women. And so I sort of get
  away with things like that.” Trump created Trump Model Management, also known
  as T Models, in 1999. T Models recruited girls as young as 14 to the US on
  tourist visas with lavish promises of fame and fortune, and once they arrived
  paid them minimally. “It is like modern-day slavery,” said one of the models,
  Rachel Blais. “Honestly, they are the most crooked agency I’ve ever worked
  for, and I’ve worked for quite a few.” Epstein wanted a modeling agency of his
  own. He admired Trump’s T Models and sought to replicate it. He invested in
  one based in Paris operated by Jean-Luc Brunel, a model agency head who was
  also accused of sex trafficking. Courtney Powell Soerensen, a model, told the
  Miami Herald: “Epstein had to have his slimy peons and Brunel was the ideal
  person to do the job.” Brunel had been the subject of a 60 Minutes exposé as
  an alleged sexual abuser of models in 1988. In New York, in the 1990s, Brunel
  lived in Trump Tower. “The modeling agency was the perfect vehicle for Epstein
  to get more victims,” Giuffre said. Heather Braden, a model, told the Miami
  Herald she saw Brunel, Epstein and Trump at parties together frequently in the
  early 1990s. Brunel was charged with rape in 2021 and died by apparent suicide
  in a French prison in 2022, about two years after Epstein’s apparent suicide.
  Trump had never before told his self-exonerating story about how he had broken
  with Epstein over Giuffre. But he had spoken publicly about his relationship
  with Epstein in 2002, when he rejoiced in their friendship to New York
  magazine: “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he
  likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger
  side. No doubt about it – Jeffrey enjoys his social life.” Little remarked
  upon in the citation of this quote was that Trump’s response to the writer
  appears intended to offer a more positive and vivid picture of Epstein, at
  least in Trump’s eyes, than the reclusive and serious image Epstein was trying
  to promote. Trump’s description was preceded in the article by this set-up:
  “Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched
  alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if
  you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges.” Trump, always seeking
  to elevate himself, preened in talking about Epstein as following his example
  as a Casanova. Now he continues to stonewall the public over the Epstein
  files. Days after Maxwell was interviewed by the deputy attorney general Todd
  Blanche in her Florida prison, she was granted transfer to a minimal security
  penitentiary in Texas. Her move heightens the intrigue surrounding her
  deposition, which the administration is keeping secret despite calls by
  Democratic senators for its release. By invoking Giuffre, Trump has activated
  her family. They were enraged by the favor suddenly granted to Maxwell and
  wonder whether it is part of a deal. “President Trump has sent a clear message
  today: pedophiles deserve preferential treatment and their victims do not
  matter,” read their statement. “This move smacks of a cover-up. The victims
  deserve better.” Trump’s ill-conceived story about Giuffre has undermined
  rather than bolstered him in maintaining control of the storyline. Sidney
