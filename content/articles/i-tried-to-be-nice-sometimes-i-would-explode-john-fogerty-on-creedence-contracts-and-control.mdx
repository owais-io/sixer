  There were once two brothers from an Irish background, living in the outer
  suburbs of a hip city. They got in a band and one of them turned out to be a
  genius songwriter and arranger. For a few years everything they touched turned
  to gold. Then they fell out, bitterly, each blaming the other for everything
  that had gone wrong. It’s the story of not just the Gallagher brothers, but
  also John and Tom Fogerty. Like Noel, John was the brilliant songwriter,
  arranger, lead guitarist and producer – but he was also like Liam, the
  frontman with one of the great rock’n’roll voices. Whereas Tom Fogerty, who
  had been the original lead singer of the group that eventually became
  Creedence Clearwater Revival, had nothing without his brother’s genius. The
  first strains came when Tom began to resent his younger brother’s leadership,
  and the demands he made on the rest of the band. It widened when Tom was the
  first to quit, in 1971. It became a chasm after Creedence completely split.
  Fantasy, the tiny jazz label that had been the only one to offer the young
  band a deal – a staggeringly onerous deal, demanding 180 songs over five years
  on a meagre royalty – freed the other three from their commitments, but
  refused to let John go, and kept ownership of his songs. Things soured further
  throughout the 1980s, when John battled to extricate himself from Fantasy, and
  from the failed offshore savings scheme the label had pushed him into which
  had left him without any of the rewards from his Creedence years. Each time,
  Tom took Fantasy’s side, proclaiming John’s nemesis, Fantasy boss Saul Zaentz,
  to be his friend. The two never reconciled. Tom died, aged 48, in 1990. The
  John Fogerty sitting in his home in California – dressed, inevitably, in a
  plaid shirt, a giant photo of himself on stage in 1969 hanging behind him – is
  cheery and tolerant on our video call, not the raging man he was through the
  decades after Creedence split in 1972. He has the stability of a long and
  happy marriage to his wife, Julie. And, as of two years ago, he has ownership
  of the 69 songs he wrote for Creedence, 20 of them also additionally
  rerecorded with two of his sons, Shane and Tyler. They will be released this
  month as Legacy: The Creedence Clearwater Revival Years. He looks back over
  the years when he was fighting for his songs, and sighs. “The best way I can
  describe it is I was imprisoned wrongfully and sent away to the penitentiary
  for many, many years.” * * * Creedence, without anyone really noticing, have
  remained the biggest rock band of the 1960s: of any band from that decade,
  only the Beatles have more listeners on Spotify each month. Weeks after he
  turned 80, Fogerty played a barnstorming Pyramid stage set at Glastonbury
  festival this summer, and the greatest hits album, Chronicle – released
  without Fogerty’s consent in 1976 – is, like, Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours,
  permanently lodged in the US album chart (currently at No 57). But Creedence
  don’t have the tumultuous love lives, the thinly veiled Broadway plays and TV
  dramas, the hanging out with Harry Styles. They may be the most unglamorous
  major band in rock history. “I’m a great believer in songs,” Fogerty says. “If
  you have enough songs, even if your playing is kind of average, you can go
  far.” But why do those songs – Fortunate Son, Bad Moon Rising, Proud Mary,
  Born on the Bayou, Green River, Have You Ever Seen the Rain, Lodi and so many
  more – endure so strongly? Perhaps its because Creedence simply sound like
  America: you can hear John Steinbeck and Mark Twain in them, as well as Little
  Richard and Howlin’ Wolf. Their name harks back to something innocent, and
  those plaid shirts – at a time when their California contemporaries were
  donning hippy finery – kept the package timeless. During his boyhood in the
  San Francisco Bay Area town of El Cerrito, “I had very strong input,” says
  Fogerty. “My mom gave me a record when I was three years old, and it was songs
  by Stephen Foster. She explained that he had been a songwriter.” Foster, a
  century earlier, had composed many of the songs that passed down in American
  folklore – Oh! Susanna, Camptown Races and more. Fogerty also paid attention
  to Pete Seeger and the folk revival, and to country music. “Even though I
  always considered myself pretty much a mainstream rock’n’roll kid, all these
  other influences were there.” By the time Creedence broke through in 1968 with
  a cover of Dale Hawkins’ Susie Q – the start of an astounding run that
  resulted in nine Top 10 hit singles up to Sweet Hitch-Hiker in 1971, and three
  classic albums in 1969 alone – the Fogertys, and rhythm section Stu Cook and
  Doug Clifford, had been making records under various names and in varying
  line-ups since 1961. By the time he started writing for Creedence, Fogerty
  knew exactly what he wanted to achieve. Each side of a seven-inch single was
  rehearsed for six weeks before recording it to achieve maximum impact, and the
  other three were instructed in exactly how they had to play. The result was
  that Creedence sounded like the tightest, most powerful garage band in the
  world. They were a juggernaut, but they could convey emotion as well. “For
  every song I wrote I threw 10 away,” Fogerty says. “When you heard one of my
  songs, I wanted there to be no doubt it was a really good song. It sounds
  grandiose to say it, but I was trying to have that as my career goal.” With no
  competent manager and a label that didn’t have a clue, Fogerty determined he
  would have to do everything. “The absolute coin of the realm, the only thing
  that I had to spend, was the music I could create. I became manic about it,
  but also paranoid, meaning I just had to work really, really hard. Whatever
  energy I had, I applied it completely to furthering the career of the band.
  And when the jealousy [from the other three members, who also wanted to write
  songs] began, I thought I could cure that by working hard.” But it didn’t
  work. Tom left after their sixth album, Pendulum. Fogerty believes it’s
  because his bluff had been called: he knew he would have to write songs for
  the next one, and that he wasn’t good enough to step up. So for the final one,
  Mardi Gras, Fogerty let Clifford and Cook write. “It was something I had been
  putting off, or pushing back against, because I thought they were incapable
  and it would mean career suicide.” It turned out to be just that – panned by
  critics, it failed to make the US Top 10 and Fogerty later called it “horse
  manure”. On 16 October 1972, Creedence announced their split. Thus began the
  wilderness years. There was a solo album in 1973, of covers, but Fogerty still
  owed Fantasy eight original albums. So he went on strike, until David Geffen
  bought out his deal and brought him to Asylum for one underpowered record in
  1975, and then more or less nothing until 1985’s hit album Centerfield, which
  resulted in him being sued by Zaentz for plagiarising himself. Fogerty won
  that one, but had to pay Zaentz for defamation over the song Zanz Kant Danz
  (later rerecorded and renamed Vanz Kant Danz). And still Zaentz wouldn’t sell
  him the Creedence catalogue. What Fogerty describes in his autobiography – an
  inability to write any new songs, an allergic reaction to his old ones (he
  would turn off the radio if they came on), a refusal to play live in any
  meaningful sense, periods of heavy drinking, reckless behaviour, disturbed
  sleep – sounds like an ongoing, decades-long breakdown. “I never really
  thought I had a nervous breakdown, but I would say I was not well,” he says.
  “Not stable, or even-keeled, or normal. It would manifest itself in strange
  ways: I remember going into a department store to buy some socks, and I was
  unable to approach the salesperson because it was far too complicated for me.
  It sounds pathetic.” No, it doesn’t. It sounds like someone very sick. “Yeah.
  I guess I might have seen a shrink, but I was in the middle of the stream
  swimming and just trying to keep my head above water.” The rage, he says,
  could make him difficult to be around. “I tried to be nice. I tried to be
  humble, but there were times when I would explode. That could come out if I
  was near people, or even if I was quite alone. It happened a few times when I
  was alone in the wilderness, fishing, and I’d just go off into a rage about my
  gear.” I tell him it sounds as though, more than anything else, he needed
  someone to take care of him. He had been, in effect, chief executive of a
  multinational company before he was 25, and had been working since childhood.
  Everyone who was meant to take care of him had let him down. “Well, yes,
  that’s true. And, boy, there’s nothing like that sense that somebody cares for
  you and they’re taking care of you. After I met Julie, she insisted some
  therapy would help me. I was telling the doctor about my situation with the
  band and he said, ‘Well, that’s betrayal. You were betrayed.’ And that’s the
  first time I’d been given a word to describe the situation.” * * * Fantasy
  wasn’t the issue by this point. Zaentz was. So when he sold his share of the
  company to Concord in 2004, Fogerty returned more or less immediately. Concord
  now owned the Creedence catalogue, and had no desire to make an enemy of their
  signing. Almost immediately, it reinstated the royalties Fantasy had
  previously withheld, and it was open to selling Fogerty his songs. It took a
  further 19 years, but it did happen, and Fogerty was delighted. “This is
  something I thought would never be a possibility,” he tweeted in January 2023.
  “After 50 years, I am finally reunited with my songs.” The first fruits of
  that ownership come in the form of the Legacy album. One of the first songs he
  worked on for it was what he believes to be his first great song, Proud Mary,
  the unlikely rock’n’roll number about a Mississippi paddle steamer. He built
  up the backing track, making it sound ragged and raw but thrillingly precise,
  exactly as Creedence did. Then he listened back to his first vocal takes.
  “There was what they call an epiphany. The track sounded really stunning, and
  the lead vocal paled by comparison. And it finally dawned on me: John, when
  you were doing this way back when, it was life or death for you. I came from a
  state of if not poverty, then the lower economic rungs. It was very important
  and necessary to be great, as great as whatever was in me. And at that point I
  felt as if I was going through a portal, and really trying to be that person
  again. I continued to work on Proud Mary that way and I ended up in a place I
  felt very good about. “My wife told me she’d been watching me from the control
  room, and she said she could see it in my face that I actually was making
  myself go back, so I continued to work that way with the rest of the songs.
  I’m just an adventurer, you know, like an explorer coming back to the
  homeland.” It’s an oddity that Fogerty’s legacy rests on songs written in such
  a short span of time. Only two of his solo albums (Centerfield and 1997’s Blue
  Moon Swamp) come within spitting distance of Creedence. It’s terrifying, too,
  that a song such as Fortunate Son – about how the sons of wealth avoid
  fighting the wars their fathers profit from – remains relevant, especially now
  the US is governed by one of those fortunate sons. “I wrote that song during
  the administration of Richard Nixon. Now Donald Trump is almost a direct
  descendant, skipping the years since 1974. Of course, Mr Trump is doing
  everything on steroids compared to Nixon. I think Nixon did have some shame. I
  don’t get that sense these days.” Fogerty, the all-American musician (right
  down to being a hunter), must have some pretty staunch Maga types among his
  fans. Does that trouble him? “There’s certainly no secret about a song like
  Fortunate Son, or Who’ll Stop the Rain” – the rain representing the rot in the
  Nixon era. “You know what my worldview must be. But I don’t hold fans
  responsible for the activities of Mr Trump. I wish everyone was a little bit
  more towards the middle. The older you get, you’re just sorry that
  everything’s so kneejerk.” The great imponderable, given how much misery it
  caused him, is whether Fogerty might have been happier without his success. If
  he had written and recorded all those songs, but no one had ever bought them
  and there had been no money to fight over, would he have happily gone back to
  El Cerrito? “I like to hope that being a history teacher – if I found my
  partner and had this wonderful life I have found – would have made me very
  happy. But my second answer … I don’t know if you can see the picture on the
  wall behind me.” He gestures to that print of him in full flight as a young
  man. “Someone asked me about that, about a month ago: ‘Tell me about that guy
  up on the wall back there.’ Maybe a couple days before that particular
  question had been asked, I actually had this conversation in my mind: John,
  would you trade places and be that 24-year-old who was so confused and unhappy
  and scratching his head trying to figure out life? Would you trade places? Or
  would you be the person you are now at 80? And my answer was, and it’ll always
  be, I want to be the guy I am here now, even though I’m 80. That poor young
  man had youth, for sure, but he was so confused about what was going on with
  his gift. I wouldn’t want to live even one day like that. I prefer being
  really happy, very settled, completely in love with my wife, Julie, having
  raised great kids. It’s a sense of being that’s irreplaceable.” • Legacy: The
