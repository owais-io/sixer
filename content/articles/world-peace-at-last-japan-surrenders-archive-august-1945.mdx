  Emperor to give orders to stop all fighting 15 August 1945 Japan has
  surrendered, unconditionally. This was announced in London, Washington,
  Moscow, and Chungking at midnight last night. Broadcasting the news at that
  hour Mr Attlee said: Japan has today surrendered. The last of our enemies is
  laid low. Continue reading. Manchester’s night of rejoicing 15 August 1945 For
  half an hour after Mr Attlee’s midnight announcement of the Japanese surrender
  the centre of Manchester remained quiet. The night-time ‘population’ of
  servicemen and girls and a few late travellers had not yet heard the news. The
  first indication of anything unusual was a flood of calls to the Manchester
  Guardian office asking if the news was really official at last. In the
  meantime the news spread and groups of singing and cheering girls and
  servicemen began to appear on the streets. A motorcar went up Cross Street
  with people sitting on the roof, shouting, and waving a large union jack. The
  one motorcar was joined by others and crowds of people, middle-aged and
  children as well as young people, began to converge on Albert Square. Many of
  the people who had been in bed or were about to go to bed when they heard the
  news dressed and came down to town. By a quarter to one Albert Square, which
  had been deserted 40 minutes before, was a solid mass of people, filling the
  square, standing on the air raid shelters, and sitting on the pedestals of the
  statues. A large section of the crowd, after unsuccessfully chanting “We want
  the mayor” for some time had their attention diverted by a soldier who climbed
  to the top of the large flagstaff in front of the town hall entrance and tied
  a union jack to the top. This feat was greeted with loud cheering, while a
  sailor proceeded to add a second flag, to a chorus of “All the nice girls love
  a sailor.” In night attire The crowd was finding other ways to amuse itself
  and one party, including a girl still dressed in her pyjamas, was vigorously
  dancing and singing Knees up Mother Brown. A Jeep, hidden beneath a mass of
  Americans, girls and children, drove back and forth through the Square, while
  fireworks were exploding continuously. There seemed to be little happening in
  Piccadilly, but here one met crowds of singing people, arm in arm, making
  their way to the town hall. Midnight scenes in London The news of the Japanese
  surrender was received in the Thames-side districts by a medley of noise from
  ships’ sirens. Many people were awakened by continuous blasts and firework
  explosions. Across the Thames in Kent bonfires were blazing in a manner
  reminiscent of the nights of the blitz. Sleep took wings and fled with the
  last clouds of war from the London suburbs. Lights blazed out long after
  midnight. An hour after the premier’s announcement the air was still echoing
  with the crack of fireworks. Hoots from river tugs sent the victory sign
  ringing out in reply to the “dot-dot-dot–dash” of the train whistles.
  Telephone operators were “flooded” with calls as soon as Mr Attlee had
  finished speaking. One trunk operator said: “We were soon working at midday
  pitch with the usual shortage of staff.” About 30 or 40 American soldiers in
  the main hall of the American Rainbow Club in the West End of London listened
  to a midnight announcement by President Truman from Washington. They greeted
  it with cheers. “They have been celebrating for days,” said an American
  observer, “and most of them are pretty tired.” Outside crowds swayed in noisy
  welcome of the midnight declaration. An enormous bonfire on Carfax blocked all
  through traffic from north, south, east, and west at Oxford. Thousands of
  people flocked the streets singing and dancing, and fireworks were exploding
  everywhere. Around the city from the many aerodromes multicoloured flares lit
  up the countryside for miles. Crowds wail in Tokyo 15 August 1945 Wailing
  “Forgive us, O Emperor, our efforts are not enough,” a weeping crowd of
  Japanese bowed to the ground before the Imperial Palace in Tokyo yesterday
  after being told that an Imperial decision had been reached. A report of the
  scene broadcast by the Japanese news agency to its offices in the Far East was
  picked up in New York and quoted by Reuter. Without explaining what the
  Imperial decision was, the agency broke off its transmission in the middle of
  a sentence and asked editors to hold the report. The Emperor’s message was
  addressed to the people gathered before the Niju-Bashi – the double bridge
  leading to the parade ground in front of the Palace, the nearest point to the
  Palace which the public is allowed to approach and where the people are
  accustomed to gather in times of crisis and celebration. Americans’ joy:
  all-night celebration in New York 16 August 1945 Americans continued today to
  celebrate the victory over Japan with undiminished vigour. The rejoicing,
  which began last night at seven o’clock when President Truman announced the
  Japanese acceptance of the Allied terms, continued all night and is still
  going on. President Truman declared today and tomorrow to be holidays for all
  employees of the federal government. Business houses throughout the nation
  closed today and probably many of them will do the same tomorrow. New York’s
  Times Square, the traditional scene of great celebrations, was packed all
  night last night by a great crowd. They cheered, sang, and waved flags, and
  pretty girls were kissed by complete strangers and took it good-naturedly.
  Throughout the city motorcars roared through the streets with horns sounding
  and the occupants shouting, while tons of torn paper floated down from
  skyscraper windows in spite of preliminary pleas by officials that paper is
  still scarce and should not be wasted. The demonstrations were much larger
  than when Germany capitulated. In Washington huge crowds gathered before the
  White House. Mr Truman and his wife appeared in the portico and greeted the
  throng. Arranging to control Japan: unrepentant tone of Tokyo 16 August 1945
  While General MacArthur is issuing orders to the Japanese to fly to Manila to
  sign the surrender and is preparing to take command of the forces that will
  shortly land in Japan, Tokyo journalists and broadcasters are declaring that
  Japan only lost the war because of the Allied superiority in material and
  civil and scientific power. Japanese spokesmen all blame the Allies for their
  methods, and one paper says the “entire nation is burning with righteous
  indignation over the enemy’s outrages.” The Emperor denied that in starting
  the war the Japanese had any aggressive ideas. The Japanese envoys should, on
  General MacArthur’s orders, leave for Manila this morning to sign the
  surrender and receive instruction. It is thought that the signing ceremony may
  not take place till next week. Men of the United States Third Fleet cheered
  the end of the war yesterday and then had to man their guns to shoot down
  about 16 Japanese planes which were approaching the American ships after the
  acceptance of the surrender terms. The British fleet shot down five. Admiral
  Halsey ordered that this should be done in a “friendly way.” See also
  Editorial: problems of peace London transfigured 17 August 1945 The floodlit
  spectacle of London is naturally much grander time than on the VE nights. From
  this building you see great illuminated flags waving and bright tops of towers
  that are lost in the darkness, and everywhere you look – north, south, east,
  and west – resplendent buildings rise like visions of the night. St Paul’s,
  that we thought so often we were seeing for the last time, rises over the
  city, transfigured, something “not made by hands.” By some technique of
  floodlighting the peristyle and dome are like precious crystals and the cross
  high over the lantern gleams like pure gold. How one remembers St Paul’s
  glowing against the darkness with another glow, red and fiery, when Ludgate
  Hill was on fire and Paternoster Row was flaming. In the west the Abbey towers
  shine out and the Westminster clock tower was like a great ornament. Above it
  was the great bright flag on Victoria Tower.
