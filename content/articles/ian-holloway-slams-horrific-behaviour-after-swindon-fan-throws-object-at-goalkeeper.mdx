  Swindon Town have launched an investigation into what their manager, Ian
  Holloway, called “absolutely horrific” behaviour by one of their fans in the
  moments after Walsall scored a late winner against them in their 2-1 League
  Two defeat on Saturday. A supporter from the away end at Bescot Stadium was
  seen throwing an object at Walsall goalkeeper Myles Roberts, while Swindon
  said they were also aware of “a number of serious incidents” including “the
  use of pyrotechnics, objects being thrown, abuse directed at stewards, staff,
  players and match officials, as well as damage caused to property within the
  stadium”. The club said it would work with Walsall to investigate the
  incidents, adding: “This behaviour has absolutely no place at our football
  club or in the wider game. Let us be clear: any individuals found to have
  engaged in such actions will face the strictest possible sanctions, including
  banning orders and legal action where appropriate.” Addressing the fan
  directly on Swindon’s YouTube channel, Holloway said: “I’m disgusted by
  whoever that person was. Whoever you are, you’re not a Swindon fan. I’m not
  having you, and I hope you get caught. That is absolutely horrific. How dare
  you put our club in the situation you’ve just done … we don’t want you in
  football. “If you’ve ripped a seat out and thrown it at somebody, I just can’t
  stand you, whoever you are. And I will find you. I want us to find that
  person, and shame them.” Earlier he told BBC Radio Wiltshire: “That’s not
  right; that’s not football. You think you’re upset and all of this? Just shut
  your face and get out of the game. It’s absolutely disgusting.”
