  I tried to write a letter recently but my hand didn’t quite cooperate: the
  result was a maniacal scrawl. I rarely put literal pen to paper any more and
  it seems my overreliance on a keyboard means I may have lost the ability to
  write legible cursive. I’m not alone: handwriting is disappearing. It’s
  possible my kid will never be taught joined-up writing at school. While typing
  is more efficient, studies suggest typing notes rather than writing may have a
  negative impact on the brain’s ability to learn. A keyboard feels like stone
  age technology now; as AI becomes more embedded in our lives, what impact will
  that have on our brains? We’re still figuring that out. The people who make
  money from the tech keep telling us we need it, or we’ll fall behind. Mark
  Zuckerberg, for example, recently said if you don’t wear AI-powered smart
  glasses, you will find yourself at a “significant cognitive disadvantage” in
  the near future. However, a recent study suggests an overreliance on ChatGPT
  could harm critical thinking abilities. And then, of course, there’s all the
  other collateral damage of AI – from its massive environmental impact to its
  exploitation of underpaid creatives’ labour. Not everyone is keen on
  participating in this brave new world. Meet the “AI vegans”: people who have
  chosen to abstain from using AI for environmental, ethical and personal
  wellness reasons. Yes, “AI veganism” is a real phrase. No, I didn’t make it
  up. Although I rather wish I did, because it’s quite catchy, isn’t it? Side
  note: one of the most genius rebrands of all time was the way fake leather
  (which is often made from polyurethane, a type of plastic) suddenly became
  aspirational “vegan leather”. Will AI veganism catch on? Who knows. But, just
  like regular veganism, I’m sure its practitioners will tell you about it. And
  while it may be unrealistic to expect the masses to go digitally vegan, it’s
  not a bad idea for us all to be more cognisant of how much AI we consume and
  its impact on the planet. Perhaps any request to AI apps should be met with a
  digital calorie count first? Yes, I can generate a picture of a cat in a
  spaceship eating a taco, but my AI model might guzzle a bottle of water to do
  so and 10 times more energy than a Google search … do you really want that
  picture? Just some food for thought. • Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist
