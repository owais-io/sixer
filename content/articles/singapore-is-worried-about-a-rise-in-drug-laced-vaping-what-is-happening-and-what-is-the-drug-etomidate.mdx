  Singapore will crack down on the vaping and drug-laced vapes from Monday,
  introducing heavier fines, lengthy prison sentences and even caning in some
  cases. Vaping has been banned since 2018 in Singapore, which is known for
  having some of the world’s toughest drug laws, but the authorities will impose
  tougher measures from September in response to concerns about the emergence of
  vapes laced with the anaesthetic agent etomidate, popularly known as Kpods,
  short for ketamine pods. Under the changes, etomidate has been reclassified
  from a poison to a Class C drug, bringing tougher penalties for misuse, while
  vapers will also face bigger fines. What is the drug etomidate? Etomidate is
  an intravenous anaesthetic, used in medical settings. However, the Singapore
  authorities say it is increasingly being mixed with vape juice. Random testing
  of confiscated vapes in July found that one in three contained etomidate,
  according to officials. Online sellers have promoted Kpods online as being
  undetectable by urine tests. Etomidate was listed as a dangerous drug in Hong
  Kong and China as of February this year, according to the United Nations
  Office on Drugs and Crime, and said it had also been found in vaping products
  in Indonesia and Thailand. What are the penalties for using vapes containing
  the drug? The reclassification of etomidate from 1 September will result in
  tougher penalties. Individuals caught using Kpods will also face tougher
  penalties, with a fine of S$500 (US$390) for under-18s, or S$700 (US$545) for
  adult offenders. They will be required to attend a rehabilitation programme
  for up to six months. Repeat offenders could face fines of up to S$2,000
  (US$1,557) and/or 10 years in jail. Individuals found to be importing Kpods
  will face between three and 20 years in prison, as well as caning, while
  offenders caught selling or distributing Kpods could be jailed for between two
  and 10 years, as well as caning. What about for those using regular vapes?
  Vaping has been banned since 2018 but remains popular in Singapore. Under new
  rules adult users will be fined S$700, while vape users under 18 will face a
  fine of S$500, with increased penalties for repeat offenders. Those caught a
  second time will have to attend a rehabilitation programme for three months,
  while subsequent offenders will be prosecuted and fined up to S$2,000. Why are
  authorities so concerned about vaping? Health minister Ong Ye Kung has said
  vapes have become a “gateway for very serious substance abuse”. The
  authorities are especially concerned that vaping is popular among young
  people, and report that about a third of vapers are under 18, and more than
  half are below 30. Under new measures, schools have been given saliva test
  kits that can detect nicotine, local media reported, and students caught
  vaping will face disciplinary action, including possible suspension or
  expulsion from school. Students suspected of using Kpods will be sent for
  urine testing. According to local media, vape bins will be introduced at
  Changi airport for travellers flying into Singapore or transiting, with more
  notices played to warn foreigners about the tougher rules. Foreign nationals
  will face the same penalties, and risk having their passes revoked, or being
  deported and banned from re-entering Singapore, according to local media.
