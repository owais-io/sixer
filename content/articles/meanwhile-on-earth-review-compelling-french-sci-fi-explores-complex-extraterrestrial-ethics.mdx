  Meanwhile on Earth review – compelling French sci-fi explores complex
  extraterrestrial ethics

  Here is a French indie sci-fi in which a woman called Elsa (Megan Northam)
  mourns her brother Franck, who is missing and presumed dead in space, which
  makes him rather less likely to be found again. Elsa works at a care facility
  for elderly people and lives with her mother and younger brother; they are all
  stuck in the kind of limbo that comes with unresolved family mysteries. One
  day, Elsa encounters Franck once more – as a voice. It seems that an alien
  presence may be able to return him to his home planet, if Elsa is prepared to
  help them out with a little favour: the aliens require four people to be
  procured for them in exchange for Franck’s return. The people won’t be killed,
  but their personalities will essentially be erased or dampened to become hosts
  for the extraterrestrials. A Hollywood blockbuster would perhaps resolve this
  dilemma quickly, as a subplot in a larger invasion plot, but here the dilemma
  is the meat of the film, a kind of thought experiment, and the challenge of
  having Elsa plausibly wrangle with her decision is what enables a fine
  performance from Northam. The film is interested in whether different lives
  have different value, which is a thorny question. You might think it is
  obvious that they are all equal, until you realise that perhaps you may feel
  differently about saving your spouse or baby over a serial killer, say. What
  that elevates animator Jérémy Clapin’s live-action debut is that it gives
  these pub chat hypotheticals a human face and emotional subtlety; this isn’t
  something like Saw, a film that plays gory games with deadly consequences.
  Instead, it uses its supernatural premise to explore some very human
  behaviour. • Meanwhile on Earth is on digital platforms from 25 August
