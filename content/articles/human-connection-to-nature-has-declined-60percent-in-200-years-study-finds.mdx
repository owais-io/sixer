  People’s connection to nature has declined by more than 60% since 1800, almost
  exactly mirroring the disappearance of nature words such as river, moss and
  blossom from books, according to a study. Computer modelling predicts that
  levels of nature connectedness will continue to decline unless there are
  far-reaching policy and societal changes – with introducing children to nature
  at a young age and radically greening urban environments the most effective
  interventions. The study by Miles Richardson, a professor of nature
  connectedness at the University of Derby, accurately tracks the loss of nature
  from people’s lives over 220 years by using data on urbanisation, the loss of
  wildlife in neighbourhoods and, crucially, parents no longer passing on
  engagement with nature to their children. In the research published in the
  journal Earth, Richardson also identified the disappearance of natural words
  from books between 1800 and 2020, which peaked at a 60.6% decline in 1990. The
  modelling predicts an ongoing “extinction of experience” with future
  generations continuing to lose an awareness of nature because it is not
  present in increasingly built-up neighbourhoods, while parents no longer pass
  on an “orientation” towards the natural world. Other studies have found
  parental nature connectedness is the strongest predictor of whether a child
  will become close to nature. “Nature connectedness is now accepted as a key
  root cause of the environmental crisis,” said Richardson. “It’s vitally
  important for our own mental health as well. It unites people and nature’s
  wellbeing. There’s a need for transformational change if we’re going to change
  society’s relationship with nature.” Richardson said when he tested different
  policy and urban environmental changes in the model he was surprised at the
  scale of the changes required to reverse the loss of connection to nature.
  Increasing the availability of biodiverse green spaces in a city by 30% may
  look like radical positive progress for wildlife and people but Richardson
  said his study suggested a city may need to be 10 times greener to reverse
  declines in nature connection. The study found that measures to increase
  popular engagement with the natural world were not effective at reversing
  long-term declines in nature connectedness. Richardson said such schemes by
  charities – for instance, the Wildlife Trusts’ #30DaysWild – were still
  important for boosting mental health but the modelling suggested they don’t
  halt the intergenerational loss of nature connection. More effective,
  according to the study, are measures instilling awareness and engagement with
  nature in young children and families, such as forest school nurseries. A
  further obstacle to restoring nature connectedness is that the modelling shows
  policies to transform early education and urban areas need to be in place over
  the next 25 years to reverse the decline. But if done, increases in nature
  connectedness would become self-sustaining. Richardson said the scale of
  societal changes required to re-establish nature connection may not be as
  daunting as they appeared because the baselines were now so low. A study found
  that people in Sheffield on average spent just four minutes and 36 seconds in
  natural spaces each day. “Increase that by [a factor of] 10, and people are
  spending 40 minutes outside every day – that may be enough,” said Richardson.
  “Working with families and parents to engage children with nature with a real
  focus on that intergenerational transmission is key. There’s already a lot of
  focus on connecting children with nature but I prefer to say – don’t
  disconnect them. A newborn child is much the same as a child born in 1800.
  Children are fascinated by the natural world. It’s maintaining that through
  their childhood and schooling that’s essential, alongside urban greening.
  There’s policies starting to do that but we’ve got to think in
  transformational terms – not 30% but 1,000%.” Intriguingly, there may be hope
  of a cultural shift. Richardson was surprised to find that nature words in
  books are actually on the increase again – with the decline having fallen from
  60.6% between 1800 and 1990 to 52.4% today. “Is it a genuine eco-awareness? Is
  it the British trend for nature writing? Is it ‘real’ or is it an artefact of
  the data? I don’t know,” said Richardson. “There has also been an increasing
  interest in spirituality in recent decades so that might reflect people
  getting back in touch with nature.”
