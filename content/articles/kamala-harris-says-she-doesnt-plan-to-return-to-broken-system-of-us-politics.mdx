  Kamala Harris has said that she currently has no desire to re-enter “the
  system” of American politics because it is “broken”. On Thursday night the
  Democratic party’s defeated presidential nominee, who replaced Joe Biden late
  in the 2024 campaign after he dropped his re-election bid, gave her first
  interview since losing the election to Donald Trump, talking to Stephen
  Colbert on The Late Show. After she announced she will not run for the
  governorship of California just a day earlier, Harris told the TV show that it
  was about something more “basic” than whether she wanted to run for something
  else instead – with the subtext being whether she will attempt a White House
  run again in 2028. “Recently I made the decision that I just – for now – I
  don’t want to go back in the system. I think it’s broken,” she said, provoking
  a collective groan from the studio audience. Colbert later returned to the
  subject, saying that her remark was harrowing. “Well, but it’s also evident,
  isn’t it?” she said. Describing herself as a “devout public servant”, the
  former vice-president added: “I always believed, that as fragile as our
  democracy is, our systems would be strong enough to defend our most
  fundamental principles. And I think right now that they’re not as strong as
  they need to be. And for now I don’t want to go back into that system.”
  Harris’s choice of The Late Show as the channel for her first post-election
  defeat interview was pointed. The most-watched talkshow was cancelled last
  month by the CBS network, which pleaded financial stress, though the decision
  was widely denounced as being politically motivated. The cancellation was
  announced after Colbert had criticized CBS and its parent company Paramount
  Global for reaching a $16m settlement with Trump. The president had sued CBS
  News over an interview on the 60 Minutes show with Harris at the height of
  last year’s presidential campaign, which Trump claimed had been manipulated in
  her favour. None of this febrile back story was mentioned by either Colbert or
  Harris on Thursday. But she did delivery a passionate lament for the numbers
  of people who she said had “capitulated” to the aggressive second Trump
  administration. When Colbert invited her to say “I told you so” after she had
  predicted many of Trump’s most contentious moves – including Medicaid cuts,
  ignoring court orders, and “massive tax cuts to the rich” – she replied: “But
  Stephen, what I did not predict was the capitulation.” She went on: “Perhaps
  it’s naive of me … there should be many who consider themselves to be
  guardians of our system and our democracy who just capitulated, and I didn’t
  see that coming.” The timing of the interview was also poignant, as she was
  considered to be the automatic frontrunner if she had decided to run to become
  the next governor of California. Her wider remarks on “the system” help
  explain that decision, though they still notably left room for another
  possible presidential run. In the meantime, Harris has a book to sell, 107
  Days, which she name-checked copiously on the Late Show in advance of its
  publication next month. The book, as its title suggests, relates the story of
  the shortest presidential run of all time. She said it would give a
  “behind-the-scenes sharing” of those intense days. Whether it is to sell the
  book or to lay the foundations for another presidential bid remains a moot
  point, but Harris said she wanted to use the next period to “travel the
  country and listen to people. I don’t want it to be transactional, where I’m
  asking for their vote.” Harris admitted that it had taken her months following
  her defeat before she had the strength to tune into the news again. “You know,
  I’m just not into self-mutilation,” she said. Instead there had been “lots of
  cooking shows”, her top choice being The Kitchen.
