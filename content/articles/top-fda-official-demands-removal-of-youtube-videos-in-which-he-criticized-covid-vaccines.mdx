  A top official at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) demanded the removal
  of YouTube videos of himself that were published by a physician and writer who
  has been critical of medical misinformation and public health officials in the
  Trump administration, according to a YouTube notice that was seen by the
  Guardian. Jonathan Howard, a neurologist and psychiatrist in New York City,
  received an email from YouTube on Friday night, which stated that Vinay
  Prasad, who is the FDA’s top vaccine regulator, had demanded the removal of
  six videos of himself from Howard’s YouTube channel. Howard’s entire channel
  has now been deleted by YouTube, which cited copyright infringement. The
  now-defunct channel contained about 350 videos of doctors and commentators,
  including Prasad, Robert F Kennedy Jr, the secretary of health and human
  services, and Jay Bhattacharya, the head of the National Institutes of Health,
  which had been collected by Howard from their social media accounts,
  interviews and podcasts. Creating the channel, Howard told Guardian in an
  interview, had been an attempt to “preserve” what these individuals had said
  during the early years of the pandemic, including comments that Howard said
  exaggerated the dangers of the Covid vaccine to children and – in some cases –
  minimized the risk of Covid infection, among other issues. “These videos were
  nothing more than collections of what other doctors said during the pandemic,
  including doctors who are extremely influential and who are now the medical
  establishment,” he said. The Guardian requested a comment from the office of
  public affairs at the department of health and human services, and attempted
  to reach Prasad through personal email addresses and by a listed mobile phone
  number. No one responded to the request for comment. When YouTube notified
  Howard of the demand request, it included an email address for Prasad, which
  is identical to the email address that is linked to Prasad’s now inactive
  podcast, called Plenary Session. Prasad, a former hematologist-oncologist at
  the University of California San Francisco, is now head of the FDA’s Center
  for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which makes him the chief
  vaccine regulator in the US. He was a vocal critic of Peter Marks, who
  previously led CBER and was widely respected for his role in Operation Warp
  Speed, the initiative that developed, manufactured and helped distribute the
  Covid-19 vaccines. Marks was forced to resign by Kennedy. Prasad has also been
  critical of the use of Covid boosters in young people and vaccine mandates,
  and has defended cuts to health agencies and university research. “It’s really
  important to remember [Prasad’s] past words in order to gauge his current and
  future credibility, and that was the mission of my YouTube channel, to record
  what these doctors [Prasad and others] said,” Howard said. Although the videos
  Howard collected were often only viewed “dozens” of times, Howard included
  them in his online articles that appeared on the Science Based Medicine blog.
  Now those video links are dead. He noted that snippets of Prasad’s comments
  still appeared on anti-vaccine social media accounts, suggesting Prasad was
  directing his removal demand only at a critic and not anti-vaccine
  influencers. In the past, Prasad has complained about censorship by social
  media companies. Howard has been quoted in the New York Times, the Guardian,
  and other publications and is the author of a forthcoming book Everyone Else
  Is Lying to You, which he said examines how the medical establishment, which
  has come into power in Trump’s second term, normalized “quackery” during the
  Covid pandemic and undermined public health. “I had thought there was a policy
  that government officials shouldn’t censor opposing perspectives, but I must
  be mistaken,” said John Moore, a scientist and colleague who is familiar with
  Howard’s book and videos. Howard told the Guardian he wanted to emphasize that
  he was not a victim, and that the ordeal of having his YouTube channel deleted
  was nothing compared with the dire situation facing scientists and researchers
  whose funding is being cut by public health institutions. Prasad has had a
  rocky start in his FDA tenure. Jeremy Faust, a doctor at Brigham and Women’s
  Hospital Department of Emergency Medicine whose Substack newsletter Inside
  Medicine is widely followed, once described Prasad as having two sides. There
  was a 2010s Prasad who was a “rigorous and professorial cancer research
  methodology expert with hundreds of peer-reviewed publications, including
  well-reasoned analyses that often stood up against some slippery stuff from
  big pharma”. And there was the “2020s Prasad”, who Faust called “newly famous
  and admired by the Right … [a] hot-headed firebrand who when asked about how
  we should move forward from the lessons of Covid-19 pandemic criticized the
  pro-masking contingent saying, “I don’t believe in forgiveness because, in my
  opinion, these pieces of shit are still lying.” Prasad briefly resigned this
  summer after he was the subject of an attack by the rightwing activist Laura
  Loomer, and then returned to his post at the FDA. He reportedly had a
  significant role in the FDA’s decision to change rules around the Covid-19
  vaccine, limiting its availability this fall to adults over 65 or those with
  certain medical conditions. Previously, Covid shots were recommended for
  everyone six months or older.
