webTitle: Breaking Bach review – breakdancing thrillingly animates 300-year-old music

  A thread of fascinating partnerships between music and movement runs through
  the 78th Edinburgh international festival, with circus skills meeting Gluck in
  Orpheus and Eurydice and puppetry realising Huang Ruo’s Book of Mountains and
  Seas. The final week has brought Kim Brandstrup and The Orchestra of the Age
  of Enlightenment in the culmination of the choreographer’s project to bring
  the music of JS Bach to young people through dance. A small edition of the
  OAE, with 18 strings, three winds and keyboard, led by Margaret Faultless, was
  raised above the Usher Hall stage, transformed, with mirrored floor and back
  wall and benches to the side, into something like a shiny school gym. And it
  was indeed in a north London high school, where the orchestra is resident,
  that the larger works took shape, Bach’s Concerto for Two Violins and
  Brandenburg Concerto No 3 uniting the breakdancing skills of the young people
  and professional dancers already familiar with Brandstrup’s vocabulary. His
  instinct that the fusion would animate 300-year-old music is thrillingly
  justified, but it does place huge demands on the instrumentalists, who
  initially sounded a little insipid in Edinburgh’s big hall until the discreet
  amplification properly kicked in. This was necessarily “strict time” Bach,
  with no room for the improvisatory freedom expected in early music
  performance, and often all the better for that. The rigorous beat made
  familiar music new, and it was a more relaxed band that played the
  instrumental interludes between the choreography. Music from the Solo Cello
  Suites, played by Andrew Skidmore, soundtracked a trio and two solos, the last
  of them daringly slow but still recognisably hip-hop in its shapes. Those and
  much of the frontline precision were performed by regular Brandstrup
  associates including Tommy Franzen, Deavion Brown, Aurora Casatori and Elyse
  Renwick-Ashun. But it was the full ensemble work, where it was often
  impossible – and irrelevant – to distinguish between those dancers and the
  young recruits, that was most exciting, particularly the Brandenburg finale.
  Bean-bag seating in the stalls, the Usher Hall was packed to the rafters, with
  many young people in the audience for this one-night-only premiere. It was not
  perfect, with even the professional dancers sometimes out of position, but it
  was already exhilarating – and has the potential to be breathtaking.
