  Garmin’s latest mid-range running and multisport watch has smartened up with a
  very bright OLED screen, voice assistant and upgraded sensors. The Forerunner
  570 continues the revamp of the company’s running watches, which have all
  gained more accurate GPS chips and improved heart rate monitors. The new model
  replaces the popular 265 and sits under the 970. It offers a similar look and
  feel to the top watch but with a few key features removed for a lower price.
  Unfortunately the reduced price is still quite high at £450 (€550/$550/A$999),
  which puts the 570 well above most mid-range rivals and dangerously close to
  top-of-the-range money. The 570 has quite a few updated hardware and software
  features, compared with the 265. It comes in a choice of 42mm or 47mm sizes
  and in a range of fun colours – or black for those looking for something more
  understated. The polycarbonate body, metal buttons and aluminium bezel feel
  high quality, with a super bright, crisp and great-looking OLED touchscreen.
  Like the Fenix 8 and Forerunner 970, the watch has Garmin’s new offline voice
  command system for quickly setting timers, accessing settings, starting
  activities and other functions of the watch. It will also connect to your
  phone’s voice assistant so you can speak to Siri or Gemini, or take calls on
  your wrist. The 570 has the same revamped interface as the 970, making it a
  more capable smartwatch for handling notifications or controlling music on
  your phone. It also supports the recently released Google Maps app, but only
  with Android phones. It can download various apps from the Connect IQ app
  store including Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music or others for phone-free
  music on runs. Garmin Pay is available for contactless payments, though UK
  bank support is very limited. The battery of the 47mm watch lasts about five
  days of smartwatch use with the screen on all the time, which is a day or so
  short of the 970 or the 265. The 570’s default screen brightness is very high,
  however, so turning it down one level added about a day to the battery life.
  It will last about 10 days with the always-on display setting turned off.
  Specifications Screen: 1.2in or 1.4in AMOLED Case size: 42mm or 47mm Case
  thickness: 12.9mm Band size: standard 20mm or 22mm Weight: 42g or 50g Storage:
  8GB Water resistance: 50 metres (5ATM) Sensors: GNSS (Multiband GPS, Glonass,
  Galileo, QZSS, BeiDou), compass, thermometer, heart rate, pulse Ox
  Connectivity: Bluetooth, ANT+, wifi Running and activity tracking The
  Forerunner has Garmin’s latest optical heart rate sensor on the back and dual
  band GPS for some of the most accurate tracking available. It has more than 85
  different sport profiles built in, so it will track most things. For running
  and triathlon it packs nearly everything that the 970 offers, including
  wrist-based power and running dynamics, adaptive coaching plans with suggested
  workouts, performance condition and various VO2 Max and fitness estimations.
  It lacks offline maps, however, only providing breadcrumb navigation on
  planned routes or back to the start of your run. It also includes Garmin’s
  useful recovery tools, such as training readiness, which are the best in the
  business. The only things it lacks are Garmin’s new impact load and running
  tolerance features that are limited to the 970, which is a shame. The battery
  lasts about 14 hours of running with the highest accuracy settings or about
  eight hours while also listening to offline music from Spotify using Bluetooth
  headphones, which is solid but not class leading and several hours short of
  the 970. The 570 has all of Garmin’s most recent general health tracking
  features, including its excellent body battery system, a sleep coach, morning
  and evening health and recovery briefings, stress, women’s health and heart
  health, with one exception: it lacks the ability to record an ECG. With
  similarly priced rivals from Apple, Google and Samsung all supporting the
  feature that helps spot heart conditions, it seems like a miss. Sustainability
  The watch is generally repairable with options available via support. The
  battery is rated to maintain at least 90% of its original capacity after two
  years of weekly charging. The watch does not contain any recycled materials.
  Garmin guarantees security updates until at least 21 May 2027 but typically
  supports its devices far longer. It offers recycling schemes on new purchases.
  Price The Garmin Forerunner 570 costs £459.99 (€549.99/$549.99/A$999). For
  comparison, the Garmin Fenix 8 starts from £780, the Forerunner 970 costs
  £630, the Forerunner 165 £250, the Coros Pace 3 £219, the Suunto Run £199 and
  the Polar Pacer Pro £299. Verdict The Forerunner 570 is a great running watch
  that is priced just a little too high to be a wholehearted recommendation. It
  looks great with standout colours, a super bright and crisp screen, and many
  of the good bits of the Forerunner 970. It is one of the most accurate for GPS
  and heart rate tracking, records almost every metric under the sun, and plugs
  into Garmin’s unrivalled training and recovery systems. It also works pretty
  well as a day-to-day smartwatch. The lack of offline maps, a built-in torch,
  ECG or the latest running tolerance features, and a shorter daily-use battery
  life could be excused at a lower price. But at £460 or equivalent, the 570
  stacks up poorly against more feature-rich rivals making it one to look out
  for on a deal. Pros: super bright OLED screen, phone and offline voice
  control, Garmin Pay, extensive tracking and recovery analysis for running and
  many other sports, offline Spotify, buttons and touch, most accurate GPS.
  Cons: expensive, no ECG, no offline maps, no running tolerance, no torch,
  limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared with
  Apple/Google/Samsung watches, shorter battery life than other Forerunners.
