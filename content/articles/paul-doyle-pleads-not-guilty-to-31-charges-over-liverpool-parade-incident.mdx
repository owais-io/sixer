  A man has pleaded not guilty to 31 charges, including dangerous driving and
  causing grievous bodily harm with intent, after a car was driven into a crowd
  of people in Liverpool in May. Paul Doyle, 53, was arrested on 29 May after
  driving through a crowd of Liverpool football club supporters during the
  team’s Premier League trophy parade in the city centre on the evening of 26
  May. Doyle was initially charged with seven offences at the time of his
  arrest, but was charged with an additional 24 in August after appearing in
  Liverpool crown court via a video link. The incident is reported to have
  occurred after Doyle allegedly followed an ambulance down a road off-limits to
  cars during the parade. His grey Ford Galaxy could allegedly be observed on
  CCTV being surrounded by fans before accelerating, running over and hitting
  many, and then coming to a stop. Police pushed back fans trying to remove him
  from the car before arresting him. The incident left 134 people with injuries
  and more than 50 requiring hospitalisation, four of whom were children. In the
  immediate aftermath of the incident police released details of Doyle’s
  ethnicity, a decision that some said could lead to difficulties for forces in
  the future.
