  gender identity views

  Ten authors nominated for this year’s Polari prizes, a set of UK awards
  celebrating LGBTQ+ literature, have withdrawn from the awards over the
  longlisting of John Boyne, who has described himself as a “Terf” – the acronym
  for trans-exclusionary radical feminist. Two judges have also withdrawn from
  the prize process, and more than 800 writers and publishing industry workers
  have signed a statement calling on Polari to formally remove Boyne from the
  longlist. Boyne, who was longlisted for the main Polari book prize for his
  novella Earth, is best known for his 2006 novel The Boy in the Striped
  Pyjamas. Author Nicola Dinan, who won the Polari first book prize last year
  for her novel Bellies, resigned from this year’s jury for the debut prize.
  Guardian journalist Jason Okundaye asked for his book Revolutionary Acts to be
  removed from this year’s first book prize longlist, while Andrew McMillan
  withdrew his book Pity from the longlist for the overall Polari book prize for
  non-debuts. Heartstopper author Alice Oseman along with the writers Nikesh
  Shukla, Julia Armfield, Naoise Dolan, Seán Hewitt and Kirsty Logan are among
  the hundreds to have signed the statement. “We are profoundly disappointed by
  the Polari prize’s decision to include John Boyne on the longlist for this
  year’s Polari book prize,” it reads. Boyne “has publicly and unequivocally
  associated himself with trans exclusionary sentiments”, it continues, citing
  an Irish Independent article in which Boyne expresses support for JK Rowling
  and describes himself as a “fellow Terf”. Boyne declined to comment. Boyne’s
  “public statements on trans rights and identity are incompatible with the
  LGBTQ+ community’s most basic standards of inclusion”, the statement
  continues. “In any year, the decision to include Mr Boyne on the longlist
  would be, in our view, inappropriate and hurtful to the wider community of
  LGBTQ+ readers and writers. That the decision has been made this year – in the
  context of rising anti-trans hatred and systematic exclusion of trans people
  from public life in the UK and across the world – is inexcusable.” Today’s
  statement was drafted in response to one made by the Polari prize on 7 August.
  “It is inevitable given the challenges we face and the diversity of the lived
  experience we now represent under the LGBTQ+ Polari umbrella, that even within
  our community, we can at times hold radically different positions on
  substantive issues,” it says. “This is one of those times.” In a statement to
  the Guardian on Monday, the Polari prize added that the “past few weeks have
  been extremely difficult for the trans and non-binary writers and communities”
  associated with the award. “The hurt and anger caused has been a matter of
  deep concern to everyone associated with the prize, for which we sincerely
  apologise. We accept and respect the decisions of those writers and judges who
  have chosen to withdraw.” “Despite these events, we are committed to going
  forward with the prize this year. However, we will be undertaking a full
  review of the prize processes, consulting representatives from across the
  community ahead of next year’s awards, taking on board the learnings from this
  year.” The Polari prize was founded by journalist Paul Burston in 2011. The
  longlists for this year’s prize were published on 1 August, with the
  shortlists due to be announced in late September and the winners on 27
  November. The statement in response, which garnered 821 signatures, was
  organised by the writers Niamh Ní Mhaoileoin and Emma van Straaten. “We want
  there to be a literary prize that recognises the vital importance of queer and
  trans stories,” it concludes. “That’s why we’re calling on the Polari prize to
  formally remove Mr Boyne from the longlist, to restore the integrity of this
  prize as a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for the LGBTQ+ community.”
  Other signatories include the writers Nussaibah Younis, Poorna Bell, Daisy
  Buchanan, K Patrick and Lex Croucher.
