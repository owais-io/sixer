  The Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East is coming to a
  close. Here’s a round-up of today’s key events: Israeli prime minister
  Benjamin Netanyahu hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now focused on a
  comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all at once,
  rather than in phases. “I want all of them,” he said of the hostages. “The
  release of all the hostages, both alive and dead – that’s the stage we’re at.”
  He added that Israel’s demands haven’t changed, and that the war will end only
  when all hostages are returned and Hamas has surrendered. The Israeli military
  said that chief of staff Eyal Zamir has approved the “main concept” for an
  attack plan in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reports. There are no further details
  yet, but we bring you updates when we get them. The approval of the plan amid
  a rift between Israel’s political leaders and its military commanders. A Hamas
  official said that Israeli forces were making “aggressive” incursions into
  Gaza City on Wednsday, after the military approved the framework for a new
  offensive in the territory. “The Israeli occupation forces continue to carry
  out aggressive incursions in Gaza City,” Ismail Al-Thawabta, director general
  of the Hamas government media office in Gaza. Israeli gunfire killed at least
  25 people seeking aid Wednesday, health officials and witnesses said.
  Witnesses and staff at Nasser and Awda hospitals, which received the bodies,
  said people were killed on their way to aid distribution sites and while
  awaiting convoys entering the strip. The Israeli military said it struck a
  group of militants in Gaza who were disguised as aid workers and using a car
  with the logo of international charity World Central Kitchen. The charity
  confirmed that the men and the vehicle were not affiliated with it. “We
  strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or other
  humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers,” it said in a
  statement. Palestinian officials said an Israeli settler shot and killed a
  Palestinian in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday, AFP reports, while the IDF
  confirmed an off-duty soldier shot someone it said was throwing rocks. The
  confrontation marks the latest fatal clash in the Palestinian territory, where
  violence has surged since the start of the Gaza war. “Thameen Khalil Reda
  Dawabsheh (35 years old) was killed by settler gunfire in the town of Duma,
  south of Nablus,” the Palestinian Authority’s health ministry said in a
  statement. Contacted by AFP, Duma village council head Suleiman Dawabsheh said
  that a confrontation broke out when a group of Israeli settlers trespassed on
  land north of the town while farmers worked on their land. Israeli gunfire
  killed at least 25 people seeking aid Wednesday, health officials and
  witnesses said, AP reports. Witnesses and staff at Nasser and Awda hospitals,
  which received the bodies, said people were killed on their way to aid
  distribution sites and while awaiting convoys entering the strip. Israel did
  not immediately respond to a request for comment. The defence ministers of
  Turkey and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding on military training and
  consultancy after talks in Ankara on Wednesday, Reuters reports, citing
  Turkey’s defence ministry. The neighbours had been negotiating a comprehensive
  military cooperation agreement for months, after the ousting of Bashar
  al-Assad in December. Earlier Turkey’s foreign minister warned Israel off what
  he said were attempts to destabilise Syria (see 13.12). Egyptian security
  sources said the ceasefire talks would discuss the possibility of a deal that
  would see Hamas relinquish governance in Gaza and concede its weapons. A Hamas
  official told Reuters the group was open to all ideas if Israel ends the war
  and pulls out. However, “Laying down arms before the occupation is dismissed
  is impossible,” the official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. Arab
  states and much of the international community want post-war Gaza to be
  governed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited governance in
  the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The authority’s foreign minister, Varsen
  Aghabekian Shahin, told reporters it was ready to assume full responsibility
  in Gaza. Hamas would have no role and be required to hand over arms, she
  added, calling for an international peacekeeping force and withdrawal by
  Israel. Hamas says it is ready to quit Gaza governance for a non-partisan
  technocratic entity agreed by all Palestinian parties. Israel says it does not
  trust the Palestinian Authority to rule Gaza. AFP carries some more quotes
  from Turkish foreign minister, who earlier said Israel was interfering in
  Syria for its own ends. “Certain actors are bothered by the positive
  developments in Syria,” Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan said after talks
  with Syria’s Asaad al-Shaibani in Ankara, referring to Israel and Kurdish YPG
  fighters operational in northeastern Syria. “Israel is currently one of the
  biggest actors in this dark picture,” he said of its ongoing military
  incursions since the overthrow of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad late last
  year. “The emergence of chaos in Syria ... appears to have become a priority
  for Israel’s own national security,” he said. Standing next to him, Shaibani
  also warned against efforts to foster chaos in Syria. “We’re facing new
  challenges that are no less dangerous than those we encountered during the
  years of war, foremost among them are repeated Israeli threats ... through
  airstrikes,” he said. Fidan said efforts to destabilise Syria could be clearly
  seen in the March bloodshed in the coastal Alawite heartland of Latakia and in
  the recent deadly violence that gripped the southwestern Druze-majority
  province of Sweida as well as in the Kurdish-dominated northeast. Shaibani
  said foreign actors were exacerbating the unrest within Syria. “We are also
  confronting multiple foreign interventions, both direct and indirect... (that)
  push the country toward sectarian and regional strife,” he said without giving
  details but warning against “any reckless attempts to exploit events here”. No
  group in Lebanon is permitted to bear arms or rely on foreign backing,
  President Joseph Aoun told a senior Iranian official on Wednesday, days after
  the cabinet approved the objectives of a US-backed roadmap to disarm the
  Iran-aligned Hezbollah group. Reuters reports that during a meeting in Beirut
  with Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s top security body, Aoun warned against
  foreign interference in Lebanon’s internal affairs, saying the country was
  open to cooperation with Iran but only within the bounds of national
  sovereignty and mutual respect. According to a statement from his office, Aoun
  said The friendship we seek with Iran must be with all Lebanese, not through
  one sect or component alone.” He added that recent language used by some
  Iranian officials had not been helpful, and reaffirmed that the Lebanese state
  and its armed forces were solely responsible for safeguarding all citizens. A
  US-brokered ceasefire late last year ended a 14-month-old war between Israel
  and Hezbollah that had caused widespread destruction in southern Lebanon.
  Agence France-Presse has more on the bombardment of Gaza City with Sabah
  Fatoum, 51, who lives in a tent in its Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood, telling the
  news agency by phone that “the explosions are massive” in the area. There are
  “many air strikes and tanks are advancing in the southern area of Tal al-Hawa
  with drones above our heads,” she said. “The tanks are still there, and I saw
  dozens of civilians fleeing” to the west of the city, she added. Gaza’s civil
  defence agency said Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City have intensified in recent
  days, with the residential neighbourhoods of Zeitoun and Sabra hit “with very
  heavy air strikes targeting civilian homes, possibly including high-rise
  buildings”. Israel’s military pounded Gaza City on Wednesday prior to its
  planned takeover, with another 123 people killed in the last day according to
  the Gaza health ministry The 24-hour death toll was the worst in a week and
  added to the massive fatalities from the nearly two-year war, according to
  Reuters. A Hamas official said that Israeli forces were making “aggressive”
  incursions into Gaza City on Wednsday, after the military approved the
  framework for a new offensive in the territory. “The Israeli occupation forces
  continue to carry out aggressive incursions in Gaza City,” Ismail Al-Thawabta,
  director general of the Hamas government media office in Gaza, told AFP.
  “These assaults represent a dangerous escalation aimed at imposing a new
  reality on the ground by force, through a scorched earth policy and the
  complete destruction of civilian property.” Israeli planes and tanks bombed
  eastern areas of Gaza City heavily overnight, residents said, with many homes
  destroyed in the Zeitoun and Shejaia neighbourhoods, Reuters reports. Al-Ahli
  hospital said 12 people were killed in an airstrike on a home in Zeitoun.
  Tanks also destroyed several houses in the east of Khan Younis in south Gaza,
  while in the centre Israeli gunfire killed nine aid-seekers in two separate
  incidents, Palestinian medics said. Israel’s military did not comment. Last
  night in a TV interview Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated
  an idea – also enthusiastically floated by US president Donald Trump – that
  Palestinians should simply leave the territory housing more than 2 million
  people after nearly two years of conflict. “They’re not being pushed out,
  they’ll be allowed to exit,” he told Israeli television channel i24NEWS. “All
  those who are concerned for the Palestinians and say they want to help the
  Palestinians should open their gates and stop lecturing us.” Arabs and many
  world leaders are aghast at the idea of displacing the Gaza population, which
  Palestinians say would be like another “Nakba” (catastrophe) when hundreds of
  thousands fled or were forced out during a 1948 war, news wire Reuters says.
  Israel’s planned re-seizure of Gaza City – which it took in the early days of
  the war before withdrawing – is probably weeks away, officials say. That means
  a ceasefire is still possible though talks have been floundering and conflict
  still rages. Britain, France and Germany have told the UN they are ready to
  reimpose UN-mandated sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme if no
  diplomatic solution is found by the end of August, according to a joint letter
  obtained by AFP. The letter to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the
  UN security council says the three European powers are “committed to use all
  diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear
  weapon” unless Tehran meets the deadline. All three have stepped up warnings
  to Iran about its suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the
  International Atomic Energy Agency. That came after Israel launched a 12-day
  war with Iran in June, partly seeking to destroy its nuclear capability. The
  US staged its own bombing raid during the war. Iran’s top security chief vowed
  in Lebanon that his government would continue to provide support for
  Hezbollah, AFP reports, after the Lebanese government ordered the army to
  devise a plan to disarm the Tehran-backed militant group. Ali Larijani’s trip
  to Lebanon comes after Iran expressed opposition to a government plan to
  disarm Hezbollah, which before a war with Israel last year was believed to be
  better armed than the Lebanese military. “If ... the Lebanese people are
  suffering, we in Iran will also feel this pain and we will stand by the dear
  people of Lebanon in all circumstances,” Larijani, the head of the National
  Security Council, told reporters after landing in Beirut. Dozens of Hezbollah
  supporters gathered along the airport road to welcome Larijani. He briefly
  stepped out of his car to greet them as they chanted slogans of support. In
  Lebanon, Larijani is scheduled to meet president Joseph Aoun and prime
  minister Nawaf Salam, as well as parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who is close
  to Hezbollah. Iran has suffered a series of blows in its long-running rivalry
  with Israel, including during 12 days of war between the two countries in
  June. Hezbollah’s grip on power has slipped since a war with Israel ended in a
  November 2024 ceasefire and the new Lebanese government, backed by the United
  States, has moved to further restrain it. New Zealand’s prime minister has
  said that Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu had “lost the plot”, accusing him
  of going too far in his efforts to wage war on Gaza, AFP reports. “What’s
  happening in Gaza is utterly, utterly appalling,” said prime minister
  Christopher Luxon. “Netanyahu has gone way too far. I think he has lost the
  plot,” added Luxon in unusually candid comments. “He is not listening to the
  international community and that is unacceptable.” New Zealand on Monday
  hinted it could join the likes of Australia, Canada, France and Britain in
  recognising a Palestinian state. “New Zealand has been clear for some time
  that our recognition of a Palestinian state is a matter of when, not if,”
  foreign affairs minister Winston Peters said. “Cabinet will take a formal
  decision in September over whether New Zealand should recognise a state of
  Palestine at this juncture – and if so, when and how.” The approval of the new
  Gaza plan by IDF chief of staff, Eyal Zamir comes amid a rift between Israel’s
  political leaders and its military commanders. Israel’s decision to approve a
  plan to occupy the Gaza Strip has reportedly deepened tensions between the
  government and the country’s military leadership, while also exposing fresh
  fractures within the army’s senior ranks and straining relations with
  reservists summoned for what could become the most dangerous phase of the war,
  the Guardian’s international corespondent Lorenzo Tondo wrote on Sunday. In
  the seven days leading up to the pivotal meeting of Israel’s security cabinet
  at which the plan was approved, the chief of staff Zamir, had repeatedly
  voiced his misgivings over the move to fully occupy the territory, warning
  that taking over Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged
  insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages.
  Zamir’s dissent ignited a political storm, with the son of the prime minister,
  Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing the army’s chief of staff of mutiny. Israel’s
  far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, urged the chief of
  staff to “clearly state he will fully comply with the political leadership’s
  instructions, even if the decision is to occupy Gaza”. Some Israeli reports
  suggested Zamir could resign, though he now appears to have approved the new
  plans. The Israeli military said that chief of staff Eyal Zamir has approved
  the “main concept” for an attack plan in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reports.
  There are no further details yet, but we bring you updates when we get them.
  On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected to complete the new Gaza
  offensive “fairly quickly”. Last week Israel’s security cabinet approved the
  plans to seize control of Gaza City. The plan was met with international
  criticism and from Israel’s opposition. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called
  the decision to send Israeli forces into Gaza City a disaster, saying it
  defied the advice of military and security officials. Cogat, the Israeli
  military agency that deals with humanitarian logistics in Gaza, has posted an
  update on aid deliveries into the territory: “Close to 320 trucks entered Gaza
  through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. Aid collection: Close to 320
  trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international
  organizations. Fuel: 3 tankers of UN fuel entered for the operation of
  essential humanitarian systems. Airdrops: 97 pallets of aid were airdropped in
  cooperation with the UAE, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and France. Humanitarian
  personnel: A rotation coordination of humanitarian personnel has been
  successfully completed. We will continue expanding our efforts to facilitate
  humanitarian aid for the civilian population of Gaza.” Yesterday foreign
  ministers from 25 countries signed a statement calling for a “flood” of aid to
  be let into Gaza, which is suffering from an acute shortage of food because of
  Israel’s blockade. The Israeli military said it struck a group of militants in
  Gaza who were disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of
  international charity World Central Kitchen, AP reports. The army said it
  carried out an airstrike on the men after confirming with the charity that
  they were not affiliated with it and that the car did not belong to it. World
  Central Kitchen confirmed that the men and the vehicle were not affiliated
  with it. “We strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or other
  humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers,” it said in a
  statement. The military shared video footage showing several men in yellow
  vests standing around a vehicle with the charity’s logo on its roof. The
  military said five of the men were armed. The charity, founded in 2010,
  dispatches teams that can quickly provide meals on a mass scale in conflict
  zones and after natural disasters. In a TV interview with an Israeli
  broadcaster last night, Benjamin Netanyahu revived calls to “allow”
  Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, as the military prepares a broader
  offensive in the territory, AFP reports. Past calls to resettle Gazans outside
  of the war-battered territory, including from US president Donald Trump, have
  sparked concern among Palestinians and condemnation from the international
  community. Netanyahu told Israeli broadcaster i24NEWS that “we are not pushing
  them out, but we are allowing them to leave”. “Give them the opportunity to
  leave, first of all, combat zones, and generally to leave the territory, if
  they want,” he said, citing refugee outflows during wars in Syria, Ukraine and
  Afghanistan. Israel has tightly controlled Gaza’s borders for years. “We will
  allow this, first of all within Gaza during the fighting, and we will
  certainly allow them to leave Gaza as well,” Netanyahu said. Israeli prime
  minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now
  focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all
  at once, rather than in phases. Arab officials told the AP news agency last
  week that mediators Egypt and Qatar were preparing a new framework for a deal
  that would include the release of all remaining hostages in one go in return
  for a lasting ceasefire and Israel’s withdrawal. The long-running indirect
  talks appeared to break down last month, but a Hamas delegation arrived in
  Cairo for fresh talks on Tuesday. In an interview with Israel’s i24 News
  network on Tuesday, Netanyahu was asked if the window had closed on a partial
  ceasefire deal. “I think it’s behind us,” Netanyahu replied. “We tried, we
  made all kinds of attempts, we went through a lot, but it turned out that they
  were just misleading us.” “I want all of them,” he said of the hostages. “The
  release of all the hostages, both alive and dead – that’s the stage we’re at.”
  He added that Israel’s demands haven’t changed, and that the war will end only
  when all hostages are returned and Hamas has surrendered. Other key updates
  include: The United Nations has warned that starvation and malnutrition in
  Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began. UN spokesman Stephane
  Dujarric reported the warning from the World Food Program and said Gaza’s
  Health Ministry told UN staff in Gaza that five people died over the last 24
  hours from malnutrition and starvation. The ministry says 121 adults and 101
  children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war. The foreign
  ministers of 25 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain and Japan
  as well as two signatories from the EU released a joint statement saying that
  “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels”. The
  statement called for the government of Israel to let in a “flood” of aid. The
  World Health Organization said Israel should let it stock medical supplies to
  deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza, before Israel enacts
  plans to seize control of Gaza City. Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office
  has said Israel is blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into the
  territory, despite allowing some aid trucks through last month under
  international pressure. Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday revived calls to “allow”
  Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, as the military prepares a broader
  offensive in the territory. Israel tightly controls Gaza. It is not clear
  where Gazans would go should they be allowed to leave the territory. Australia
  prime minister Anthony Albanese said his Israeli counterpart Benjamin
  Netanyahu was “in denial” about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a day
  after announcing Australia would recognise a Palestinian state for the first
  time.

That means a ceasefire is still possible though talks have been floundering and conflict still rages. Britain, France and Germany have told the UN they are ready to reimpose UN-mandated sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme if no diplomatic solution is found by the end of August, according to a joint letter obtained by AFP. The letter to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres and the UN security council says the three European powers are “committed to use all diplomatic tools at our disposal to ensure Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon” unless Tehran meets the deadline. All three have stepped up warnings to Iran about its suspension of cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. That came after Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, partly seeking to destroy its nuclear capability. The US staged its own bombing raid during the war. Iran’s top security chief vowed in Lebanon that his government would continue to provide support for Hezbollah, AFP reports, after the Lebanese government ordered the army to devise a plan to disarm the Tehran-backed militant group. Ali Larijani’s trip to Lebanon comes after Iran expressed opposition to a government plan to disarm Hezbollah, which before a war with Israel last year was believed to be better armed than the Lebanese military. “If ... the Lebanese people are suffering, we in Iran will also feel this pain and we will stand by the dear people of Lebanon in all circumstances,” Larijani, the head of the National Security Council, told reporters after landing in Beirut. Dozens of Hezbollah supporters gathered along the airport road to welcome Larijani. He briefly stepped out of his car to greet them as they chanted slogans of support. In Lebanon, Larijani is scheduled to meet president Joseph Aoun and prime minister Nawaf Salam, as well as parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who is close to Hezbollah. Iran has suffered a series of blows in its long-running rivalry with Israel, including during 12 days of war between the two countries in June. Hezbollah’s grip on power has slipped since a war with Israel ended in a November 2024 ceasefire and the new Lebanese government, backed by the United States, has moved to further restrain it.

Israel’s decision to approve a plan to occupy the Gaza Strip has reportedly deepened tensions between the government and the country’s military leadership, while also exposing fresh fractures within the army’s senior ranks and straining relations with reservists summoned for what could become the most dangerous phase of the war, the Guardian’s international corespondent Lorenzo Tondo wrote on Sunday. In the seven days leading up to the pivotal meeting of Israel’s security cabinet at which the plan was approved, the chief of staff Zamir, had repeatedly voiced his misgivings over the move to fully occupy the territory, warning that taking over Gaza would plunge Israel into a “black hole” of prolonged insurgency, humanitarian responsibility and heightened risk to hostages. Zamir’s dissent ignited a political storm, with the son of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing the army’s chief of staff of mutiny. Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, urged the chief of staff to “clearly state he will fully comply with the political leadership’s instructions, even if the decision is to occupy Gaza”. Some Israeli reports suggested Zamir could resign, though he now appears to have approved the new plans. The Israeli military said that chief of staff Eyal Zamir has approved the “main concept” for an attack plan in the Gaza Strip, Reuters reports. There are no further details yet, but we bring you updates when we get them. On Sunday, Benjamin Netanyahu said he expected to complete the new Gaza offensive “fairly quickly”. Last week Israel’s security cabinet approved the plans to seize control of Gaza City. The plan was met with international criticism and from Israel’s opposition. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called the decision to send Israeli forces into Gaza City a disaster, saying it defied the advice of military and security officials. Cogat, the Israeli military agency that deals with humanitarian logistics in Gaza, has posted an update on aid deliveries into the territory: “Close to 320 trucks entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings. Aid collection: Close to 320 trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international organizations. Fuel: 3 tankers of UN fuel entered for the operation of essential humanitarian systems. Airdrops: 97 pallets of aid were airdropped in cooperation with the UAE, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and France. Humanitarian personnel: A rotation coordination of humanitarian personnel has been successfully completed. We will continue expanding our efforts to facilitate humanitarian aid for the civilian population of Gaza.” Yesterday foreign ministers from 25 countries signed a statement calling for a “flood” of aid to be let into Gaza, which is suffering from an acute shortage of food because of Israel’s blockade. The Israeli military said it struck a group of militants in Gaza who were disguised as aid workers and using a car with the logo of international charity World Central Kitchen, AP reports. The army said it carried out an airstrike on the men after confirming with the charity that they were not affiliated with it and that the car did not belong to it. World Central Kitchen confirmed that the men and the vehicle were not affiliated with it. “We strongly condemn anyone posing as World Central Kitchen or other humanitarians, as this endangers civilians and aid workers,” it said in a statement. The military shared video footage showing several men in yellow vests standing around a vehicle with the charity’s logo on its roof. The military said five of the men were armed. The charity, founded in 2010, dispatches teams that can quickly provide meals on a mass scale in conflict zones and after natural disasters. In a TV interview with an Israeli broadcaster last night, Benjamin Netanyahu revived calls to “allow” Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, as the military prepares a broader offensive in the territory, AFP reports. Past calls to resettle Gazans outside of the war-battered territory, including from US president Donald Trump, have sparked concern among Palestinians and condemnation from the international community. Netanyahu told Israeli broadcaster i24NEWS that “we are not pushing them out, but we are allowing them to leave”. “Give them the opportunity to leave, first of all, combat zones, and generally to leave the territory, if they want,” he said, citing refugee outflows during wars in Syria, Ukraine and Afghanistan. Israel has tightly controlled Gaza’s borders for years. “We will allow this, first of all within Gaza during the fighting, and we will certainly allow them to leave Gaza as well,” Netanyahu said. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has hinted that ceasefire efforts in Gaza are now focused on a comprehensive deal that would release the remaining hostages all at once, rather than in phases. Arab officials told the AP news agency last week that mediators Egypt and Qatar were preparing a new framework for a deal that would include the release of all remaining hostages in one go in return for a lasting ceasefire and Israel’s withdrawal. The long-running indirect talks appeared to break down last month, but a Hamas delegation arrived in Cairo for fresh talks on Tuesday. In an interview with Israel’s i24 News network on Tuesday, Netanyahu was asked if the window had closed on a partial ceasefire deal. “I think it’s behind us,” Netanyahu replied. “We tried, we made all kinds of attempts, we went through a lot, but it turned out that they were just misleading us.” “I want all of them,” he said of the hostages. “The release of all the hostages, both alive and dead – that’s the stage we’re at.” He added that Israel’s demands haven’t changed, and that the war will end only when all hostages are returned and Hamas has surrendered. Other key updates include: The United Nations has warned that starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at the highest levels since the war began. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric reported the warning from the World Food Program and said Gaza’s Health Ministry told UN staff in Gaza that five people died over the last 24 hours from malnutrition and starvation. The ministry says 121 adults and 101 children have died of malnutrition-related causes during the war. The foreign ministers of 25 countries including the UK, Australia, France, Spain and Japan as well as two signatories from the EU released a joint statement saying that “humanitarian suffering in Gaza has reached unimaginable levels”. The statement called for the government of Israel to let in a “flood” of aid. The World Health Organization said Israel should let it stock medical supplies to deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza, before Israel enacts plans to seize control of Gaza City. Gaza’s Hamas-run government media office has said Israel is blocking the entry of more than 430 food items into the territory, despite allowing some aid trucks through last month under international pressure. Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday revived calls to “allow” Palestinians to leave the Gaza Strip, as the military prepares a broader offensive in the territory. Israel tightly controls Gaza. It is not clear where Gazans would go should they be allowed to leave the territory. Australia prime minister Anthony Albanese said his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu was “in denial” about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, a day after announcing Australia would recognise a Palestinian state for the first time.
