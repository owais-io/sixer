  The official trial of age assurance technologies that could be used to keep
  under-16s from accessing social media has found that while there are effective
  options, errors are inevitable and age estimation tools are more likely to
  make mistakes for users within two years of 16. The long-awaited report from
  the trial found that companies may need to provide multiple “fallback options”
  such as ID checks in those cases where age estimation technology fails. The
  $6.5m age assurance technology trial, run by the UK-based Age Check
  Certification Scheme (ACCS), tested various types of technology that could be
  used by social media platforms and adult websites to keep out under-16s or
  under-18s, respectively, when Australia’s under-16s social media ban comes
  into force in December. The report, released by the communications minister,
  Anika Wells, on Sunday evening, runs to 10 volumes, testing 60 technologies
  from 48 age assurance vendors. It tested out facial age estimation, age
  verification using IDs, parental controls, parental consent, age inference and
  other methods including verification on the phone operating system level. Sign
  up: AU Breaking News email ACCS said in the report it was not the role of the
  trial to recommend a specific type of technology or whether age assurance
  should be used at all. It conducted 28,514 facial age estimation tests with 13
  vendors across Australia and found most tests took less than 40 seconds to
  complete. It was a “fundamental misunderstanding” of age estimating technology
  that it could be used without a “margin of error”, the report said: “False
  negatives will then be inevitable and alternative methods will be required to
  correct them.” The report found there is a two- to three-year “buffer zone”
  for facial age estimation where it is likely that errors in correctly
  estimating a person’s age will increase, for example if a user is 17 and it
  estimates them to be under 16, or a 14-year-old told they are over 16. The
  report said these users would probably need to be referred for age
  verification as a fallback method. “The implementation of buffer thresholds
  also plays a crucial role in enabling successive validation, a layered
  approach to age assurance where one method (e.g. age estimation) is followed
  by a second, more definitive method (e.g. document-based verification) when
  uncertainty is high,” the report said. For people aged 16 and 17, false
  rejection rates remained “above acceptable levels” for facial age estimation,
  the report found, at 8.5% and 2.6% respectively. Another major issue
  identified was that there were accuracy issues for older adults, non-Caucasian
  users and female-presenting people near the age levels tested, as well as
  underrepresentation of Indigenous people in the training data. “Skin tone is a
  known source of bias in age estimation systems,” the report said. “As light
  reflects off a subject’s face and into the camera sensor, lighter skin tones
  tend to return more detail-rich signals because they reflect more light;
  darker skin absorbs more light, reducing contrast and lower data availability
  for the algorithm to analyse.” The report noted that both Meta and Snapchat
  already use facial age estimation technology. Other biometric tests, including
  hand gestures and voice analysis, were said to be “promising” but still not
  yet developed enough for wide deployment. Under the law, providers can use age
  verification via ID checks as one method but it cannot be the only method
  offered. The report also found while most age verification providers kept as
  little data as possible, there was “concerning evidence” that, without
  guidance, some providers were “over-anticipating the eventual needs of
  regulators about providing personal information for future investigations” and
  were building tools to enable regulators or law enforcement to retrace actions
  of people to verify their age, which the report said could lead to increased
  risk of privacy breaches. Age inference – where a platform estimates a user’s
  age based on behaviour of the account, interests, friends and other data – was
  found to be useful to flag likely underage access and support interventions or
  trigger fallback mechanisms such as age estimation, and is more “low friction”
  for users who are over the age restriction. Circumvention using AI and faked
  images were also something vendors said they had tools to combat, such as
  using live motion tracking in facial age estimation. Some vendors highlighted
  their software could be used to detect if users were using virtual private
  network connections to dodge the age restriction requirements in Australia.
  The report found that while it was “promising, this approach raises its own
  challenges related to accuracy, evasion tactics and the implications for user
  privacy and cross-border service access”. Wells said there was no “one size
  fits all” solution to age assurance. “This trial shows there are many
  effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded.” The
  federal government was “pushing forward with our mission to keep kids safer
  online through world-leading reforms”.
