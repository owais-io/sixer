  An animated caper about singing teenagers who secretly battle the forces of
  evil has confirmed its status as the breakout hit of the summer after becoming
  Netflix’s most-watched film in its history. KPop Demon Hunters, which tells
  the story of a world-famous all-female K-pop group tasked with protecting the
  world in their spare time, has become a surprise sensation since its launch in
  June. Netflix has now confirmed the film is its most viewed of all time in any
  genre, overtaking its 2021 action movie Red Notice, which featured the
  Hollywood sparkle of the A-listers Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal
  Gadot. KPop Demon Hunters has now had more than 236m views. It has also broken
  records at cinema box offices and in the music charts over recent weeks,
  defying concerns that original, animated movies were losing their lustre. The
  film follows the story of Huntr/x, a group of three girls – Rumi, Mira and
  Zoey. They have to juggle their stardom with their secret status as demon
  hunters, which comes with the weighty responsibility of protecting the world.
  If that wasn’t enough to clog up their diaries, they also have to battle
  against a rival band, Saja Boys, whose members are secretly – yes – demons.
  The film became Netflix’s first No 1 in the US movie box office charts over
  the weekend after a singalong version was given a limited theatrical release,
  selling out shows across more than 1,000 venues. It scooped a reported $18m
  (£13.4m) in a single weekend, though Netflix does not share data about its
  earnings from theatrical releases. Its success came despite Netflix’s apparent
  resistance to cinematic releases: the streamer tends to release a film in
  cinemas only when it is a requirement of making it eligible for awards season.
  Audiences in the UK were also given the chance to attend cinema showings last
  weekend, with screenings similarly packed, before the release of the
  sing-along version of the film on Netflix. Unsurprisingly for a film based on
  a pop group, the soundtrack has been key to its popularity, setting records of
  its own. It has become the first soundtrack ever to have four songs in the top
  10 of the US Billboard Hot 100 at the same time. Its main hit, Golden, remains
  at No 1. Three of its tracks are in the top five – the first time a soundtrack
  has achieved such a feat since Saturday Night Fever in 1978, when the Bee Gees
  wrote the three hits Night Fever, Stayin’ Alive and If I Can’t Have You, sung
  by Yvonne Elliman. Meanwhile, other animation made by established studios has
  struggled this summer, as the likes of Disney and Universal Pictures have
  opted to pursue live-action remakes of popular hits such as Lilo &amp; Stitch
  and How to Train Your Dragon. Demon Hunters bucks the trend of remakes and the
  relentless exploitation of back catalogues, instead embracing an entirely new
  story of unknown characters, songs and stars. The movie was produced not by
  Netflix but by Sony Pictures Animation, which also made the Spider-Verse
  movies and has adopted an arresting visual style. KPop Demon Hunters has a
  persistent pink and purple hue. The show spotlights the importance of another
  recent cultural phenomenon – the cult of fandom. The love of the group’s fans
  plays a key role in the film, while the movie’s real-world followers have
  driven its summer successes. Ironically for a fantastical animated tale, some
  of those involved in the film say it is the relatability of the characters to
  its young audience that has inspired its popularity. “On stage, they’re
  perfect,” said Arden Cho, one of the film’s main voice actors. “But put them
  together and they’re goofy, they’re real, they’re making funny faces. They eat
  all the things that they want, and they’re burping. I think it makes us, as
  girls, feel seen.”
