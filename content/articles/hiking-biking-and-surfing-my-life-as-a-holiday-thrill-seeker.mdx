  Marriott Bonvoy® American Express® Card (Representative 53.3% APR Variable,
  Annual fee applies, 18+, Subject to status, terms and conditions apply) It’s
  not that I don’t like reading a book on a sun-lounger by the pool, lazing in a
  beachside hammock, or getting pampered at a hotel spa – I love all of those
  things – but I only like doing them once I’ve filled the day with some
  adrenaline-charged activity first. Whether you’re rafting, surfing or mountain
  biking, adventure travel gets you out into nature and out of your comfort zone
  – it makes your holiday more memorable, and your relaxation time feel so much
  sweeter. I can’t think of the last holiday I went on that didn’t involve some
  kind of outdoor or ocean-based adventure. Maybe it was in early childhood when
  my parents tried to take me around their choice of city-based museums a few
  times before realising we’d all have a far more relaxing trip if we chose
  holidays centred around the beach, where I would spend all day playing in the
  waves. I still love being in the sea, and surfing is one of my favourite
  pastimes. There are so many incredible places around the world for wave riding
  – from Sydney’s iconic Bondi beach (where I visited as a youthful backpacker),
  to Seminyak, a beach resort area at the southern end of Bali – that it can be
  difficult to choose one destination when you’re booking a holiday. Courtyard
  Bali Seminyak Resort Seminyak is a popular destination for surfers of all
  ability levels. Stay at the Courtyard Bali Seminyak Resort, a vibrant hotel
  just a short walk from the beach and a stone’s throw from some of Bali’s
  finest bars and restaurants. Alternatively, Marriott Bonvoy® American Express®
  Cardmembers can accumulate 6 points for every £1 spent at hotels participating
  in Marriott Bonvoy, so you could use your Card to dine at the hotel’s
  restaurant, savouring local and international flavours – ideal for those who
  have built an appetite after a busy day in the surf. And with two points for
  every £1 spent elsewhere, using your Marriott Bonvoy® Amex® Card means that
  whatever you spend can also help towards your next surfing trip. And there are
  other activities aside from surfing. Guests can try their hand at kitesurfing
  or wakeboarding lessons, or even travel to the island’s tropical jungle-rich
  interior for a mountain bike trip, including a descent down a volcano. In fact
  research has found that biking and hiking are the most popular activities for
  adventure-seeking holidaymakers. And for me, it’s easy to see why. When I was
  younger, my most memorable travel experiences were mountain biking on
  boulder-strewn trails in South Africa’s Western Cape and through black lava
  fields beneath Bali’s Mount Batur, hiking amid wonderful canyons in Chiapas,
  Mexico, and the jagged peaks of Poland’s Tatra mountains. If you are after a
  more leisurely cycling holiday, albeit still one filled with adventures, head
  to Copenhagen, one of the world’s most bike-friendly capitals. Explore this
  outdoorsy city on two-wheels, taking in its beaches, its famed harbour baths,
  and traditional Danish fare, such as open-faced rye sandwiches, all while
  collecting Marriott Bonvoy® points as you go – which you can redeem for future
  stays, experiences and more. Whether you choose to stay at a hotel
  participating in Marriott Bonvoy, such as Residence Inn Copenhagen Nordhavn
  (you can rent bikes at reception) on the waterfront, or the Nobis Hotel
  Copenhagen, a Member of Design Hotels, housed in an historic building that
  once served as the Royal Danish Conservatory of Music, the Marriott Bonvoy
  American Express Card will help elevate your stay. All Cardmembers
  automatically start with Silver Elite status, which includes perks such as
  Priority Late Checkout (subject to availability) And after all that cycling,
  your legs might thank you for a later start. You can upgrade to Gold Elite
  status with even more benefits when you spend £15,000 in a year as a Marriott
  Bonvoy Amex Cardmember. I am fortunate in that my children (aged 12 and 14)
  and husband are as hungry for adventure as I am. Our highlight trips have
  included a surf and safari adventure in Sri Lanka and climbing via ferratas in
  the French Alps. This summer, we’re planning to go rafting and on an overnight
  bivouac hike in the French Pyrenees. Residence Inn Copenhagen Nordhavn And it
  appears, with our thirst for adventure, we’re not alone. More holidaymakers
  than ever are looking to book trips which include unique and immersive
  thrill-seeking activities, and that trend is set to accelerate over the next
  decade, according to research. And if you’re having so much fun on your
  holiday that you’re reluctant to go home, Marriott Bonvoy American Express
  Cardmembers can also benefit from a Free Night Award – creating extra time for
  more adventures. How does the Marriott Bonvoy American Express Card work? For
  every £1 you spend on your Card, you’ll receive two Marriott Bonvoy® points.
  If you’re using your Card at a hotel participating in Marriott Bonvoy, you’ll
  receive six points per eligible £1 spent. Points can then be redeemed to
  explore 9,500 properties across more than 30 leading brands in 144 countries
  and territories, and on more than 150 airlines. The Marriott Bonvoy American
  Express Card is also well suited to regular travellers. All Cardmembers start
  with Silver Elite status, and they are eligible for a Free Night Award after
  spending £25,000 in a year. Search for Amex Marriott Bonvoy for more
