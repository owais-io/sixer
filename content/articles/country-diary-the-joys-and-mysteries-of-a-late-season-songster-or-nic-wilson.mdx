  It’s not been the best week. I live with an energy-limiting illness, so after
  giving a series of talks on my new book, I’ve needed several days in bed. And
  while I’ve been resting, battling the boredom of fatigue, every morning and
  evening a blackcap has serenaded me through my open window. His song is sweet
  and clear, despite the background rumbling of trains, planes and automobiles.
  He reminds me of wilder places beyond my bedroom. My first blackcap of the
  year was by the wet meadows back in February, a melodious yet puzzling song,
  given the season. I knew that a growing number of blackcaps were spending the
  winter in the UK, but hadn’t realised that they can sometimes be heard tuning
  up in readiness for the breeding season. We’ve certainly noticed more
  blackcaps around in midwinter in recent years. One memorable January, we
  spotted a male on our leafless apple espaliers during the Big Garden
  Birdwatch. We could only assume he was unaware of the mass exodus
  traditionally undertaken by garden birds as soon as 600,000 bird lovers reach
  for their binoculars on the last weekend in January. These overwintering
  blackcaps aren’t, as one might assume, the same birds that breed in the UK,
  staying put after the warmer months. Instead, these individuals spend their
  summers on the continent then their winters here, rather than migrating to
  long-established wintering sites in the Mediterranean and north Africa.
  Studies initially suggested these birds migrate from central Europe, but more
  recent research shows they come from a wider area, including Spain and Poland,
  to take advantage of our warming winters and well-stocked garden feeders. Some
  are even evolving rounder wingtips, possibly due to leading more sedentary
  lifestyles. Yet our estimated 10,000 overwintering blackcaps are just a
  fraction of those that undertake the more orthodox migration patterns and
  breed in the UK. These summer birds are abundant in Hertfordshire and they’ve
  nested in the scrub on the railway embankment across the road for some years
  now. This spring, though, I listened for the blackcap’s lilting notes in vain.
  How wonderful, then, to hear this late-season songster. And how lucky I am
  that, no matter how exhausted I feel, birds never fail to intrigue and delight
  me. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary,
