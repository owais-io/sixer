  Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an
  adviser, with a remit to challenge government thinking. Greg Jackson has
  joined the Cabinet Office board, an influential core of government advisers,
  as a non-executive member. The announcement comes weeks after ministers ruled
  out his plan to split the national energy market into regional zones, which
  would have meant users in different areas would pay different rates for their
  electricity. The tech entrepreneur, who has long had links to the Labour
  party, responded to that decision by saying he would “respectfully disagree”.
  Jackson failed to win over ministers after a long and controversial campaign,
  in part because zonal pricing would have meant higher energy prices in the
  south-east of England and lower prices in Scotland. He claimed that
  electricity prices that reflected local supply and demand dynamics would
  encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that have more
  renewable energy generation such as Scotland and encourage renewables
  developers to base their projects closer to where their energy was needed.
  Jackson is now expected to play an influential role in shaping how future
  government policies are implemented. His non-executive role is one of a number
  that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from outside
  government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on policy
  decisions. Jackson is expected to use his three-year term on the Cabinet
  Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder, who set up
  Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the energy
  supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company in less
  than a decade. He has maintained strong links in the government after
  previously serving as head of the pressure group Labour List. He met the new
  Labour government alongside Octopus colleagues 10 times in the 12 weeks after
  the election, according to official records first reported by Politico. He
  told the Guardian: “Having been brought up with a sense of civic duty, I’m
  really proud to have the chance to contribute to public service. Finding ways
  to improve services without spending more is key to public services, the
  economy and our society, and if through business I’ve learned lessons on
  technology, delivery and organisation that can be useful to government, it’s
  an honour to share those.”
