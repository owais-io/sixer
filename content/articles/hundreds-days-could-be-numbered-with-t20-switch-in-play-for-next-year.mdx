  The Hundred could be changed to a Twenty20 competition as soon as next year.
  The 100-ball format is enshrined in the England and Wales Cricket Board’s
  domestic TV contracts with Sky Sports and the BBC until 2028 but the Guardian
  has learned that both broadcasters are open to switching to T20 next summer if
  requested by the newly formed Hundred board, which will be dominated by
  representatives of the eight franchises. The ECB first explored dropping the
  Hundred in favour of the global-standard T20 format two years ago in informal
  discussions, which drew a lukewarm response from Sky in particular. The
  broadcaster has invested heavily in marketing the Hundred, which has succeeded
  in attracting more diverse crowds to grounds and has a younger TV audience
  than other forms of cricket on the network, while the BBC also likes the
  format as it is easier to fit shorter matches into its schedules. The sale of,
  in most cases, minority stakes in the eight franchises for £520m this year has
  altered the power dynamics, however, with the new co-owners expected to have a
  huge influence over the future of the competition given the collective size of
  their investment. Four of the joint owners are Indian Premier League
  franchises, two are Indian‑American consortiums, and two are US investment
  companies. Formal discussions will not take place until the Hundred board
  meets for the first time in October, but the issue of format is expected to
  feature prominently. The 20-strong board will be made up of four
  representatives from the ECB and two each from the eight host venues and new
  investors, which in effect puts the franchises in control. A source at one
  franchise said the IPL owners in particular want to switch to T20 to align
  with the other franchise leagues where they operate teams in India, South
  Africa, the US and the United Arab Emirates. The T20 format will also be used
  in the Olympics when cricket returns after 132 years at Los Angeles 2038,
  which is particularly significant given India are bidding to host the Games in
  2036. The Hundred this summer is in effect a transitional tournament before
  the new owners formally come on board on 1 October, when the sales of Oval
  Invincibles and Trent Rockets are due to be completed. While Sky and the BBC
  have resisted ditching the Hundred until this point, there is a growing
  feeling that it would be better to relaunch the competition with a bang next
  year rather than make a series of incremental changes. There will be other
  significant innovations next year, including new team names at some
  franchises, new commercial deals and a fresh digital strategy. Another source
  confirmed that if T20 was to be embraced it should be done next year rather
  than wait until 2028. It is anticipated that the Hundred name and branding
  would be retained after a format change, given it is established.
