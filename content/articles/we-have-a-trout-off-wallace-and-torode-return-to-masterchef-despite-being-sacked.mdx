  sacked

  To say that this year’s MasterChef UK has been an unmitigated calamity for the
  BBC feels like an understatement. In early July, Gregg Wallace was fired from
  the show after a series of sexual misconduct allegations, including one
  accusation of unwanted touching (45 out of 83 claims against him were upheld
  following an official report), leaving the BBC with a headache over whether to
  broadcast the latest series, which was filmed last autumn. It then emerged
  that the report into Wallace’s behaviour had also highlighted an accusation of
  racist language on the part of his co-host of 20 years, John Torode. The BBC
  swiftly dispensed with him, too, despite him saying that he doesn’t believe
  the incident happened. The corporation confirmed in late July that it would
  broadcast the series anyway; one contestant, Sarah Shafi, was so appalled by
  the decision that she agreed to be edited out. Meanwhile, the broadcasting
  union Bectu said: “If [the BBC] are serious about addressing this
  industry-wide problem, broadcasters should not reward bad behaviour with
  primetime coverage.” Perhaps unsurprisingly, no advanced screeners were
  offered to the media; the first three episodes landed unannounced on BBC
  iPlayer on Wednesday morning, ahead of its 8pm broadcast on BBC One. And so to
  the programme itself. Would the first episode be full of jarring jump-cuts,
  introduced to minimise the presence of Torode and Wallace? Would it seem as
  though the pair had just happened to wander on to the set now and again? It
  began like any other series of MasterChef, with the narrator, India Fisher,
  introducing the latest “battle for the ultimate culinary prize” between 60 new
  contestants, over some characteristically tense music. As in previous series,
  Wallace and Torode featured prominently in the opening montage, alongside
  nervous contestants and lingering shots of plates buckling under the weight of
  jus and garnishes, with Torode saying: “This is the sort of stuff that dreams
  are made of,” and Wallace describing one dish as “a cracker of a job”. As
  usual, the first challenge was “basic to brilliant”. As usual, Torode and
  Wallace introduced the conceit (contestants have to zhoosh up a workaday
  grocery item of their choosing). The duo stood and salivated at the prospect
  of digital marketing manager Thea’s gorgonzola risotto and recruiter Gon’s
  take on the Thai dish kaphrao. But there wasn’t as much in the way of witty
  repartee between the hosts and the contestants, unlike the previous series,
  which opened with one participant declaring that they “[couldn’t] wait to meet
  John and Gregg and hoping that Wallace would give their dish a “phwoar” of
  approval. Nonetheless, both were definitely, firmly hosting the show. Wallace
  was limited to asking questions rather than offering up punchlines, but he
  delivered his usual gushing critiques. Speaking of business development
  manager Gemma’s mackerel-heavy take on the Malaysian national dish, nasi
  lemak, he said: “I could dip bread in this all day.” Torode quibbled over
  whether vocal coach Beth’s chocolate and orange ganache tart was, in fact,
  merely a chocolate tart. Overall, very much business as usual. Gon and Shaun,
  a digital marketing manager, received the first aprons and progressed to the
  next round. Then it was on to the mystery box challenge, with the amateur
  cooks charged with fashioning a dish from any or all of trout, beetroot and
  chocolate. As always, there was some light chat from Torode and Wallace about
  the sort of mistakes the contestants might make, with comments that seemed far
  from truncated. “We have a trout-off!” declared Torode as four contestants
  reached for the fish. Wallace quizzed writer Penelope about her skills with
  invention and asked whether her couscous was likely to turn into porridge. The
  critiques were largely effusive, even if Torode did have to console an
  overwhelmed Thea with the words: “It’s a big thing, isn’t it MasterChef?”
  Those words would take on a greater meaning in the months after filming. Thea
  was booted off alongside Gemma, with Penelope and Beth bagging the next two
  aprons. In the final round, the four remaining contenders cooked for the 2024
  champion, Brin Pirathapan, and the finalists Chris Willoughby and Louise Lyons
  Macleod. As the hosts fawned over Gon’s Thai-influenced steak tartare and
  risotto and Shaun’s scissor-cut noodles, it was just like old times.
  Pirathapan, Willoughby and Lyons Macleod took centre stage as the food started
  to appear, but not in a way that seemed out of the ordinary for the show’s
  guest judges. Still, their presence was surely a boon to Banijay, the producer
  of the show, which could give over a huge chunk of the episode’s final 20
  minutes to their discussions about what makes a good tartare and whether fish
  and apples should ever be on the same plate. But there was still much time
  given over to Wallace and Torode, speaking with their mouths half-full, raving
  over a chicken dish that Wallace said he could have eaten by the kilo. By the
  time the names of the three contestants advancing to the next stage of the
  competition were announced over a bed of uplifting plinky-plonk music, it was
  easy to forget that there had ever been a national controversy. It was always
  going to be a challenge to be faithful to the series while also editing out
  the two people at the centre of it, but if episode one is anything to go by,
  it seems the BBC and Banijay have decided essentially to ignore the problem
  and hope that putting out more or less the same show as ever will suffice.
  Maybe further chopping the contributions of Wallace and Torode would have felt
  ludicrous, but it might also have been the right thing to do. Instead, the BBC
  is getting to have its chocolate ganache tart and eat it. Still, you imagine
  the ratings will be astronomical. Phwoar indeed. • This article was amended on
  6 August 2025 to clarify the circumstances in which Sarah Shafi was edited out
  of the MasterChef series.
