  A book-loving American woman in her 20s decides to spend time in Europe before
  she settles into the safety of a finance job in New York City, but she ends up
  falling for a man who is harbouring a tragic secret about his future. She’s
  played by an in-house Netflix star, he’s played by a non-American actor known
  for his role in a hit TV show. The film is based on a novel and is premiering
  on a streaming platform this month. While this might not be dramatically
  similar enough to become a Dante’s Peak/Volcano situation, it’s hard not to
  watch Amazon’s The Map That Leads to You, out this week, and frequently think
  about Netflix’s loosely similar My Oxford Year, released at the start of
  August. What immediately separates the two, and often separates Netflix and
  Amazon movies in general, is the aesthetic. My Oxford Year is every bit a TV
  movie while The Map That Leads to You is as glossy and sweeping as one
  deserving of a big screen release. That’s both the Jeff Bezos budget bump but
  also the benefit of having a director like Lasse Hallström at the helm. The
  Oscar-nominated Swedish film-maker was once Hollywood’s master of the
  middlebrow movie, behind Sunday afternoon specials like Chocolat and The Cider
  House Rules. But it’s his later Nicholas Sparks adaptations Dear John and Safe
  Haven that made him the ideal choice here, smoothly guiding an adaptation of
  JP Monninger’s sappy 2017 novel The Map That Leads to You (the book is even
  adorned by a Sparks quote). Trusty hands help in making the film feel grander
  especially when the emotion of the story, adapted by Dante’s Peak’s Les Bohem
  and Don’t Make Me Go’s Vera Herbert, can’t quite get us there. We meet Heather
  (Madelyn Cline) and her two friends as they near the final stretch of their
  Eurotrip, perfectly bullet pointed to the final detail. Heather is a type A
  over-thinker, whose Notes app schedule for her post-graduation and pre-first
  job in the city hurrah did not include having a meet-cute with Jack
  (Riverdale’s KJ Apa), a handsome New Zealander and fellow Ernest Hemingway
  fan. He’s everything she isn’t – impulsive and unplanned – and she finds
  herself changing her plan, and herself, as the pair start to fall in love. Apa
  is a likable enough actor but he struggles to sell a lot of Jack’s manic pixie
  dream boy shtick, blandly insisting on the power of living in the moment and
  saying things like: “I really believe that your thoughts help create your
  future,” with a straight face. The film’s reheated messaging about the
  importance of following heart over head is ultimately a sneaky way to push the
  female lead off her course and on to his, as she relinquishes control to let
  him lead the way. Their jaunt around Europe, now on his terms, is a simple,
  seductive watch less for their burgeoning relationship, although they have
  decently sparky chemistry, and more for the crisply captured scenery, a lush
  and transporting late summer trip for us stuck at home, from Spain to Portugal
  to Italy and so on. Hallström knows exactly how to make his films look and
  feel delectable and at a time of ongoing streamer tinniness, it’s a pleasure
  to be led by someone who truly knows where he’s going. It’s just a shame that
  we’re being led somewhere so familiar. Not just because My Oxford Year
  recently took us there too (the “reveal” is almost identical) but because so
  many romantic dramas have taken us there before. Both films try to avoid the
  standard cliches that come with the territory but neither manages anything
  truly new or, more importantly, poignant enough to bring the tears that should
  be cascading by the finale. Cline, as she recently showed in the I Know What
  You Did Last Summer sequel, is an incredibly engaging young star but one hopes
  her career leads her somewhere more unconventional next. The Map That Leads to
  You is available on Amazon Prime Video on 20 August
