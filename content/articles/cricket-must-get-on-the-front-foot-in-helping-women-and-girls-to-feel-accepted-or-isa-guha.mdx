  Nearly a quarter of a century has passed since myself and Ebony Rainford-Brent
  made our England cricket debuts. It was awesome for us to win World Cups
  together as the first two female internationals from ethnically diverse
  backgrounds. Since then there have been only four others, two with an Indian
  heritage. When you think of the interest shown in the game by the South Asian
  community, it is a staggering number. In 2022 I founded a charity, Take Her
  Lead, in honour of my mum, with the aim to increase the number of women and
  girls playing and staying in the game, and advance equity and diversity in
  cricket. We do this through connecting young players from under‑represented
  groups to aspirational role models through life-skills workshops, to build the
  mental and social skills required to stay in the sport (girls are 20% more
  likely to drop out of sport than boys). We also support women who work or
  volunteer in cricket and sports broadcasting, and fund research. While there
  is increased visibility and investment in the women’s game, there is still a
  lot to be done at grassroots and community level. When Take Her Lead conducted
  a survey of 1,000 women and girls in 2022, we found that the majority didn’t
  feel they belonged in the sport. Our mission is to make sure every woman and
  girl has the best possible experience of cricket whenever and however they are
  involved. One of our projects will be to give girls from South Asian
  backgrounds the support they need to stay in the sport. We have recently set
  up an advisory panel of current and former international and domestic
  cricketers, and experts in community and development, and the National Asian
  Cricket Council, and will be working with the South Asian Cricket Academy
  (Saca) to support 10 professional players. In the past few years I’ve
  reflected on my own personal journey, and asked myself why I’ve been one of
  the few from my background. At my first England Under-15s training camp, at
  12, my first experience was someone joking about my spots. While being judged
  on your appearance is common for young people, its impact can be felt more
  when you look and feel different. For the rest of the weekend I segregated
  myself from everyone else and ended up getting told off by my coach. I was
  also very unfit and struggled to keep up. When the next training weekend came
  round, I told Mum I didn’t want to go. Now, South Asian families are starting
  to realise cricket can be a viable career option and encouraging their
  daughters a lot more, but 25 years ago those attitudes were very different so
  I was grateful to my parents, who encouraged me to keep going. Mum gave me the
  advice and strength to go back and do the talking with my cricket. I also
  forced myself to get better at running: in the evenings, after school, Dad
  would drop me off a certain distance from home and I would have to run back
  with him following me in the car. I eventually got to the standards I needed!
  Asian parents at that time were rarely so supportive of young girls who let
  sport take focus away from their studies, more so than boys, but with the help
  of mine I could do both. When I first played for England the media celebrated
  the fact I was the first woman of Indian heritage to make the team. At the
  time I didn’t want the added attention but I soon realised how important
  representation is. I also became more conscious of how people viewed British
  South Asian cricketers, both male and female – I think there was a feeling we
  were bad at fielding, lacked fitness and weren’t as resilient, so I tried so
  hard to prove we weren’t like that and I never wanted to be dropped for those
  reasons. It’s fair to say, with more visibility of South Asian female role
  models around the world, that tag has shifted. In the England dressing room I
  didn’t talk about my culture too much. Not because I didn’t feel like I could,
  I just wanted to keep those parts of my life separate. In 2002, the year after
  my debut, I won the BBC Asian Sports Personality of the Year award, and the
  whole team came to the ceremony to support me. That really helped me feel part
  of the set-up. I went on to have a decade-long international career, but so
  many other South Asian girls have left the game or not taken it up at all.
  Earlier this year Hina Shafi, a PhD researcher at Birmingham City University,
  joint‑funded by Take Her Lead, the England and Wales Cricket Board, Saca and
  the Ace Programme, published a study highlighting the lack of representation
  of diverse backgrounds on the ECB’s talent pathway. She found that while South
  Asian women and girls make up 11.6% of participants at youth level, that drops
  to only 3.3% of the country’s professional female cricketers. Two of those 150
  professionals are black. Of all parts of British society, South Asian women
  and girls are the least likely to take part in recommended levels of physical
  activity. It is not just about fitness, there are also issues with nutrition –
  to support me, Mum had to completely change the way she cooked at home. Period
  dignity historically for South Asian girls was also not talked about, and I
  relied on friends and teammates. Coaches also need an understanding that if a
  player prioritises their studies or a family event, it doesn’t mean they are
  not committed. I said no to an Ashes tour because of my A-levels! Thankfully
  it didn’t set me too far back in the pecking order. It is also important not
  to clump South Asian communities into one big group: the challenges for a
  Muslim girl might be different to one from the Indian Hindu community, and
  even within that group there’ll be lots of different cultures. I picked up a
  quote from the former Australian international footballer Moya Dodd: “Boys
  need to be competitive to feel accepted, but girls need to feel accepted to be
  competitive.” That acceptance is exactly what we are trying to achieve.
