  The heaviest cookbook I own is Profumi di Sicilia, which I bought from a
  secondhand bookshop in Tor Marancia the same afternoon I twisted my ankle. The
  accident had nothing to do with the 3.1kg book, which was already safely on
  the back seat of the car by the time I didn’t notice the kerb or the cyclist.
  Years on, and the scene repeats on me whenever I see the cream cover of not
  just the heaviest, but maybe the most handsome cookbook on my shelves. Written
  by the journalist Giuseppe Coria and first published by Vito Cavallotto
  Editore in 1981, Profumi di Sicilia is an encyclopaedic exploration of
  Sicilian regional cooking – the smells, ingredients, recipes, folklore,
  trivia, traditions and origins. A significant part of the book’s great beauty
  is the photographs of ingredients, dishes and scenes by Melo Minnella, which
  saturate the pages with colour and which appear in pairs every eight pages of
  text. Broken into many familiar chapters and subchapters, with small line
  drawings – a snail, bowl, potato or flask – the hundreds of recipes are in
  paragraph form, with many containing no quantities at all – just a description
  of how to put ingredients together to make X. Others, meanwhile, have specific
  quantities included in the descriptive paragraph, but always with plenty of
  leeway; Giuseppe’s ability to judge when a reader/cook needs general advice
  and when they need specific quantities is not just impressive, but inspiring.
  The great number of recipes for each ingredient, which run into each other in
  narrative style, also makes the book a good, practical source of inspiration
  when you have an ingredient you are not quite sure what to do with, and hope
  the solution involves things you already have in the house. Last week, that
  was aubergines, which are now available all year, I know, but which are at
  their best from July to September (and also plentiful and, therefore, good
  value). Giuseppe has 25 aubergine recipes, and my favourites include braised
  in olive oil with potatoes and mint, as part of a caponata with capers and
  pine nuts, and “in agrodolce”. This week’s recipe is a mix of all three.
  Giuseppe suggests honey as the dolce (sweet) element, alongside red-wine
  vinegar to provide the agro (or the sour/acidic balance). Warming the two in a
  frying pan is ideal, because there is then plenty of space to roll the roast
  aubergine wedges in the dressing before adding the capers, pine nuts and mint,
  which is a natural and feisty partner for the velvet texture of the veg. Much
  like caponata and scapece, this is best left to sit for at least an hour
  before eating, turning the aubergine wedges a few times so they sop up the
  dressing. Sweet-and-sour aubergines with capers, pine nuts and mint goes
  spectacularly well with lamb chops (mint sauce lovers will appreciate this),
  as well as with roast chicken or hard-boiled eggs. Alternatively, serve it
  alongside other room temperature dishes such as tabbouleh, chickpea and roast
  red pepper, or a tomato salad. Sweet-and-sour aubergines with capers, pine
  nuts and mint Serves 4 2 large or 4 slender aubergines Olive oil Salt 2 tbsp
  red-wine vinegar 2 tbsp honey, or sugar 2 tbsp small capers 1 tsp pine nuts,
  or chopped almonds 1 handful fresh mint leaves, left whole if small, ripped if
  large Pull the stalks off the aubergines, then cut them into long pieces
  (quarters or eighths, depending on the size of the aubergines). Rub with the
  olive oil and some salt (hands are the best tool for this), then arrange on a
  tray and bake 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 for 25 minutes, turning two or three
  times, until golden, soft and wrinkled. Meanwhile, warm the vinegar and honey
  in a frying pan, tasting to make sure that it is both sweet and sour to your
  liking. Add six tablespoons of olive oil and taste again. Add the roast
  aubergine in batches, turning until they glisten, then lift on to a serving
  plate, leaving most of the sauce in the pan. Add the capers, nuts and mint to
  the sweet-and-sour sauce, heat for a minute, then pour over the aubergines.
  Leave to sit for at least 30 minutes, turning occasionally, before serving.
