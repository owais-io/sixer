  Former directors of Entain, the gambling company that owns Ladbrokes and
  Coral, are among 11 people who have been charged with offences including
  bribery, fraud, cheating the public revenue, tax evasion and perverting the
  course of justice. The Crown Prosecution Service said on Thursday that it had
  authorised the prosecution of 11 individuals for seven offences in relation to
  the provision of gambling services in Turkey between 2011 and 2018. The CPS
  said it had charged Kenny Alexander, the former chief executive of Entain ,
  Lee Feldman, its former chair, Richard Cooper, its former finance director,
  and Robert Hoskin, its former legal director, as well as James Humberstone,
  who held several roles with the company. It also charged six other people who
  did not work for Entain. Ten of the people were charged with offences
  allegedly committed between 2011 and 2018, and one was charged with an offence
  relating to the investigation by HMRC. The CPS, which said it had worked with
  HMRC investigators, said the offences related to bribery, conspiracy to
  defraud, fraudulent trading, cheating the public revenue, evasion of income
  tax, acting as a director of a company when undischarged bankrupt and
  perverting the course of justice. All of the former directs of Entain,
  formerly GVC Holdings, were charged with conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy
  to bribe between 2011 and 2018, except Hoskin, who was charged with perverting
  the course of justice in February 2024. The first hearing in the case will be
  heard on 6 October at Westminster magistrates court. Richard Las, director of
  HMRC’s fraud investigation service, said: “This has been a complex and
  international investigation. These are serious charges that relate to
  conspiracy to defraud, bribery, cheating the public revenue, evasion of income
  tax and perverting the course of justice among others.” A spokesperson for
  Entain said: “The company has not been charged and none of the individuals
  charged are currently employed by the company or its group. “The company
  entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the CPS in December
  2023 which, subject to continued compliance with its terms, resolved the HM
  Revenue and Customs investigation insofar as it concerned the company and its
  group. “The company has no further comment to make in respect of these
  matters, which are the subject of ongoing criminal proceedings and reporting
  restrictions.”
