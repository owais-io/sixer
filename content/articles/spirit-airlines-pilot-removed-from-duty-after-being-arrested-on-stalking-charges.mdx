  A Spirit Airlines pilot has been “removed from duty” after being arrested at
  work at New Orleans’ international airport on stalking charges out of Kansas,
  according to officials. Dominic A Cipolla, 40, was charged with stalking two
  different people in a criminal complaint dated 11 July, records in the Johnson
  county courthouse in Olathe, Kansas, show. Officials haven’t released much
  information about the charges against Cipolla, but the dates of birth listed
  in court documents for his alleged victims indicate that they are
  approximately 12 and 17 years old. Local law enforcement officers arrested
  Cipolla in connection with that complaint on 17 July while he was working at
  Louis Armstrong airport in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner, Louisiana. He was
  held as a fugitive at a local lockup before being transferred to the Johnson
  county jail on 2 August. He soon posted a $12,500 bond for his release from
  custody while awaiting the outcome of the charges against him and was
  tentatively scheduled to make an initial court appearance on 12 August,
  records show. When asked about Cipolla on Monday, a spokesperson for Spirit –
  which is based in Florida and known for its low air fare – said in a statement
  that the company was “aware of a matter involving a pilot at Louis Armstrong
  New Orleans International Airport … which was unrelated to the performance of
  their job duties”. “The pilot was removed from duty pending our investigation
  into the matter,” the airline’s statement said. “And we arranged for another
  pilot to operate the flight.” Records in Cipolla’s case show that the charge
  he faces in connection with the younger of the two alleged victims is
  considered a severity level 7 person felony in Kansas, which is a crime that
  can carry about one to three years in prison under the state’s laws. The other
  charge is considered a class A person misdemeanor, which can carry a fine of
  up to $2,500 or up to a year in county jail. Cipolla is described as a
  resident of Kansas City, Missouri, in court records. Kansas City is about 22
  miles (35km) north of Olathe. A profile under Cipolla’s name at a publicly
  accessible sales and recruiting platform says he once served in the US
  military and joined Spirit in 2022 as a first officer after spending the
  previous three years in the same role at the Texas regional airline Envoy Air.
  Attorney Brandan Davies issued a statement on behalf of Cipolla calling him “a
  two-time combat veteran with not so much as a speeding ticket on his record”.
  “Mr Cipolla denies the allegations against him and asks that the media allow
  the court process to take place,” Davies’s statement said.
