  Downton Abbey fans will be able to secure a souvenir from the period drama as
  costumes worn by the characters, furniture used to adorn the stately home, and
  even the family car used in the popular ITV series and subsequent films are to
  be sold at auction for charity. A dress worn by the late Dame Maggie Smith,
  who starred as Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, is one of the
  star lots. The wedding dress Michelle Dockery wore as Lady Mary Crawley when
  she married Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens, is also up for sale. The
  pale apricot chiffon long-sleeved dress comes with a pair of ivory satin Mary
  Jane shoes, a paste tiara and silk tulle veil and a bouquet of prop lilies,
  and is estimated at between £3,000-£5,000 in the online sale by the auction
  house Bonhams. The Granthams’ family car, a 1925 Sunbeam Saloon, which Bonhams
  said was one of about 45 of the vehicles to survive, has an estimated sale
  price of £25,000 to £35,000. It was first seen in season two and used
  throughout seasons three, four and five, as well as all three films. Even the
  distinctive bell wall from the servants’ hall and a large pitched pine
  refectory table in 18th-century style acquired for season five for the
  servants’ hall are among the lots. There are lady’s maid and footmen uniforms,
  and the butler Mr Carson’s distinctive silver pocket watch. A script from
  season one, episode one, signed by cast members including Smith, Hugh
  Bonneville and Samantha Bond is listed for an estimated £600 to £800. Proceeds
  from the auction will go to Together for Short Lives, a charity supporting
  children with life-limiting conditions and their families. Gareth Neame, the
  show’s executive producer, said: “The world of Downton Abbey is beloved around
  the globe for its rich, timeless storytelling. These iconic set items hold a
  special place in that history, and we are proud to see them help support the
  vital work of Together for Short Lives.” The auction is available for bidding
  online from Monday at bonhams.com.
