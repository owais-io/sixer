  When James Joyce first travelled from Dublin to Trieste in 1904, he went via
  Paris, Zurich and Ljubljana. Zurich, because he mistakenly believed a job to
  be awaiting him there, and Ljubljana because – groggy after the night train –
  he thought they’d pulled into Trieste. By the time he twigged, the train had
  departed and, without ready cash, Joyce and his partner Nora Barnacle had to
  spend a night on the tiles. Preferring to travel by train, when I received the
  invite to be writer-in-residence at the James Joyce summer school in Trieste,
  I wondered if I might follow Joyce’s route. But repair work on Austria’s
  Tauern Tunnel prevented me from taking the exact route. Besides, today’s TGV
  tears through France at nearly 200mph, in comparison to the 25-60mph speeds at
  which Joyce would have navigated Switzerland and Austria. A night on the town
  in Milan is just as good for the muse. Along the route from London to Trieste
  (and then by bus to Ljubljana), I considered the lineage of writers who
  traversed Europe in this way 100 years ago and how different their aesthetic,
  physical and emotional experiences must have been. And, importantly, what they
  would have seen. What we see from trains – and how we see it – reflects a
  century of profound social, economic and environmental transformation. Trains
  represent progress as much as they ever have, but – today – a different sort
  of progress. My journey got off to an eventful start when the Eurostar
  announced delays due to cable theft near Lille. Around 600 metres of copper
  cable were stolen overnight from the high-speed line. A testament to the
  proficiency of France’s railway workers, we arrived roughly on time in Gare du
  Nord, Paris. A station where Joyce penned a letter to his brother, observing:
  “I hate the bustle but the station has its own strange poetry, the sound of
  footsteps, the distant whistle of the steam engines, and the sudden clanging
  of the signal bell.” For those sounds of steam whistling, coal shovelling,
  bells clanging, currencies exchanging and porters calling, today we have
  digital chimes, polylingual announcements, and beeping ticket barriers. Across
  the city, fake bird sounds chirp throughout Gare de Lyon, intending to induce
  calm, but instead making people search overhead for the poor trapped birds.
  Instead of the illustrated posters of the belle epoque, emblazoning the walls
  of the metro from Gare du Nord today are climate change equations from Liam
  Gillick’s artwork The Logical Basis, commissioned for the COP21 climate
  conference held in Paris in 2015. Honouring the climate models of Nobel
  prize-winning physicist Syukuro Manabe, Gillick’s work has been criticised for
  not explaining the equations, and so keeping the simple, crucial facts of
  climate change at a remove from the general public. It still seems to be the
  case that we don’t understand our own impact on the climate crisis.
  Electrified trains allow us to travel with a fraction of the carbon footprint
  of air travel. I still fly but try to find alternatives when I can. Less
  mental and moral gymnastics are required when travelling by land or sea –
  especially while temperatures break all records. So trains are simply more
  relaxing … except financially. Virginia Woolf, who travelled solo from London
  to Turkey by train when she was 24, wrote that “a traveller, even though he is
  half asleep, knows, looking out of the train window, that he must look now,
  for he will never see that town, or that mule-cart, or that woman at work in
  the fields, again”. Never mind that woman, to see any person working in the
  fields from a train window these days is unlikely. Instead of vibrant country
  villages (and the explosion of cities taking place in the early 20th century),
  we have urban sprawl and suburbanisation that would have been unimaginable in
  Woolf’s time. Instead of the diverse cereal and crop production of a century
  ago, today’s fertilised pastures of animal agriculture and vast tracts of land
  used to grow animal feed dominate European landscapes. The consequences of
  that are everywhere, from the overall temperature (France is 1.9C warmer than
  it was in 1900) and weather pattern changes, to soil degradation, polluted air
  and waterways, and biodiversity loss. But to know how radically the landscape
  has changed in just a few decades is to know to what degree it can change
  again. In the early 20th century, rail passengers would have witnessed the
  hydroelectric revolution, as water power in the Alps was being developed
  extensively. The construction of dams and reservoirs fundamentally altered
  alpine hydrology, creating the artificial lakes, dams, power lines and
  industrial infrastructure we’re used to today. One undoubtedly positive change
  in the past 100 years has been a significant effort towards reforestation. And
  while those forests are generally commercial – with about 80% classified as
  “forest available for wood supply” – natural forests and meadows are almost
  instantly possible with a shift towards a plant-rich diet, as just one
  example. And pastures might be replaced with solar or wind farms. Perhaps
  there’s something helpful in seeing where our energy comes from, so that we
  understand its impact. Writers took great courage in the hydroelectric
  revolution: it allowed them to reach the Alps by train. It represented
  progress, modernity and independence, as did the electric trains themselves.
  For a period, rail became militarised, and trains were rerouted for troop
  movements and deportations, with civilians facing extreme delays, rationing
  and danger. Joyce fled his home in Trieste (then part of the Austro-Hungarian
  empire) during the first world war, as he was considered an enemy alien. At
  Feldkirch station in Austria, he narrowly escaped arrest. (His brother had
  already been separately arrested, in Trieste, and was detained until the end
  of the war.) He later told his biographer that “at Feldkirch station,” he
  “felt the fate of Ulysses was decided”. During the second world war, many
  writers and artists were among those who used Europe’s rail network to flee
  the Nazis. When sniffer dogs boarded the TGV on the French-Italian border, and
  police demanded to see my passport and to know which bags were mine and the
  reason for my travel, I replied: “The James Joyce Summer School,” propping up
  my Books Upstairs tote bag and nodding at Ulysses on my tray table, which
  surely cast me as a bad spy. Before the first world war, passports and visas
  were rarely required within western Europe. After the war, this changed, and
  border stops were far longer and more frequent, to allow for paper checks. But
  if Joyce carried a passport in 1904, it would have been a British one, with
  him being classified as a British subject. I was surprised to discover that
  Joyce repeatedly rejected the opportunity to obtain an Irish passport,
  post-independence. I knew from reading his work that he spurned narrow
  nationalism, embracing a cosmopolitan and diverse European modernism. But to
  reject an Irish passport was to limit his practical freedoms. Samuel Beckett’s
  Irish passport allowed him to stay in France and take part in resistance
  activities. Spending the vast majority of their lives on the continent, they
  both strongly identified as European. Europeanness is surely defined – even
  today – more by train travel than by anything else. Despite Frantz Fanon
  brilliantly immortalising a racist incident on a train in France in his book
  Black Skin, White Masks, rail travel in Europe has been a sanctuary from
  racial prejudice for many, like Jamaican-American writer Claude McKay and poet
  Langston Hughes. Hughes wrote of the freedom from segregation and
  ostracisation on Soviet Union trains in particular: “No Jim Crow on the trains
  of the Soviet Union”. He travelled to south central Asia on the
  Moscow-Tashkent express, a journey which Russia’s war on Ukraine prevents
  today – largely cutting off the entire eastern world from Europeans who don’t
  fly. Trains have been for many artists a mode of escape as well as a means of
  belonging. They are communal and sustainable, and they cannot but make us more
  considerate. Post-Covid, there is something consoling in the quiet
  companionship of trains. Well, not always quiet, but writers spend so long
  alone in caves (with our characters), it does us good to remember that real
  people exist, with all their tuna sandwiches and taking off of shoes. Class
  segregation is less stark today than in the 20th century’s first-, second- and
  third-class carriages. Today’s first and second classes are largely
  differentiated by seat size, phone-charging facilities, and the occasional
  cufflink. In place of Edwardian plush velvet upholstery and decadent dining
  cars, today we enjoy scratchy, synthetic, easy-to-clean interiors, and
  minimalist dining cars full of Dutch teenagers. Writers – barring those with
  patrons or trust funds – can generally be found in the cheap seats. The
  enlivening, philosophical aspects of train travel carry on into the 21st
  century: observing life and landscape; partaking in a sustainable
  infrastructure; witnessing the endless novelty, education and privilege that
  it affords; making one think, as Joyce put it, “of all the worlds moving
  simultaneously”. Air travel has undoubtedly facilitated untold progress, but
  progress is subjective and contextual. It always involves an untold or
  suppressed story. Slow travel allows us to think in the longer term. It could
  serve us well to better see where we have come from and where we are going.
