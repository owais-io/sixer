  A 75-year-old Florida man has just received his high school diploma decades
  after his education was derailed by severe abuse that he endured as a teenager
  while attending a notoriously brutal reform school. As he recounted to the
  local news outlets WTVT and WTSP, Eddie Horne’s stroll across the graduation
  stage at a ceremony Thursday at St Petersburg high school in Pinellas county,
  Florida, fulfilled a goal that he set for himself after fighting to overcome
  the trauma inflicted on him beginning at age 14 at the state-run Dozier School
  for Boys. He says he hopes his time in the media spotlight can serve as an
  inspiration to others who have grappled with substantial life setbacks. Horne
  was a student in 1964 and 1965 at the Dozier school, which became synonymous
  with molestation, vicious beatings and neglect. “It was horrible – it was
  horrible,” Horne said to both WTVT and WTSP in describing his and his
  brothers’ experience at the school. “I don’t know how many licks I got. I
  didn’t count. I didn’t count, but it was horrifying. “And they just came down
  like they’re swinging a baseball bat on you.” Horne eventually dropped out of
  high school as a sophomore to financially support his family, the Pinellas
  county public education system said in a statement cited by WTSP. “They
  weren’t teaching you nothing,” Horne remarked, according to WTVT. “That’s why
  I lost out on a lot of my education.” Nonetheless, to keep a promise he made
  to himself when he dropped out, Horne signed up to pursue his high school
  diploma through a compensation program for victims of abuse at Dozier and the
  similar Okeechobee school. The Florida legislature passed the bill creating
  the program in June 2024, and it aimed to provide $20m to the schools’
  victims. More than 100 boys are known to have died at the Dozier school alone
  between 1900 and 1973, as WTVT reported. Investigations and accounts from
  survivors established physical abuse at the school was widespread, and it was
  shuttered in 2011. Horne participated in Thursday’s graduation ceremony and
  attained his diploma after completing the compensation program’s requirements.
  “Now I got it, … I’m happy,” Horne said to WTSP afterward. “I feel like I can
  do anything I want to do now.” The Pinellas public education superintendent,
  Kevin Hendrick, told WTVT that he was gratified at Horne’s academic comeback.
  “To see somebody who’s been through that have this moment tonight and just to
  see his joy, his passion, his energy – it’s rewarding,” Hendrick said. WTSP
  reported that Horne had applied to work as a criminal justice specialist at
  the county courthouse. He said to WTVT that his words of wisdom to his fellow,
  younger graduates was: “Don’t let no obstacle come in your way.” “Keep on
  fighting,” Horne added, according to WTSP. “Don’t give up your ship. If it’s
  sinking – don’t give it up. Just keep going.”
