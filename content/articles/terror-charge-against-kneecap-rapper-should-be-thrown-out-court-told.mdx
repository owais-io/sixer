  The criminal case against the Kneecap rapper Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh should be
  thrown out, a court has heard. Ó hAnnaidh, who performs with the band under
  the stage name Mo Chara, will have to wait until 26 September, when the chief
  magistrate, Paul Goldspring, will rule on whether he has the jurisdiction to
  try the case. The Belfast musician was greeted by hundreds of supporters as he
  arrived at Westminster magistrates court on Wednesday for a three-hour
  hearing. The Metropolitan police arrested a man outside the court on suspicion
  of supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. A force spokesperson
  said: “A man remains in police custody after being arrested on suspicion of
  supporting a proscribed terrorist group, Palestine Action, in Marylebone Road,
  NW1, this morning.” Surrounded by officers, he told reporters his handmade
  sign made no reference to any proscribed organisations. Prosecutors allege Ó
  hAnnaidh, 27, displayed a flag in support of the proscribed terror
  organisation Hezbollah at a gig at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London,
  last November. Ó hAnnaidh, of Belfast, is yet to enter a plea to the charge
  and is on unconditional bail. During the hearing on Wednesday, his defence
  team argued the case should be thrown out, citing a technical error in the way
  the charge against him was brought. Brenda Campbell KC told the court the
  attorney general had not given permission for the case to be brought against
  the defendant when police informed him he was to face a terror charge on 21
  May. She said consent was given the following day, but that meant the charge
  fell outside the six-month timeframe in which criminal charges against a
  defendant can be brought. The prosecutor Michael Bisgrove said permission was
  not required until the defendant’s first court appearance and that permission
  did not need to be sought in order to bring a criminal charge. Hundreds of
  Kneecap supporters waving flags and holding banners greeted Ó hAnnaidh as he
  arrived at court alongside his Kneecap bandmates, Naoise Ó Cairealláin and JJ
  Ó Dochartaigh. Demonstrations in support of the rapper were organised outside
  the court building in London, as well as in Dublin. The Metropolitan police
  imposed conditions limiting where the demonstration outside the court could
  take place, saying they were needed to “prevent serious disruption”. Fans held
  signs reading: “Free Mo Chara” while others waved Palestine and Irish flags
  before the rapper’s arrival at court. Ó Cairealláin and Ó Dochartaigh sat at
  the back of the courtroom with three others as Ó hAnnaidh confirmed his name,
  date of birth and address to the court at the start of the hearing.
