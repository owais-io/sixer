  Julius Chibonda has moved twice in the past 16 months in search of enough
  water and fertile land to support his entrepreneurial dreams, one of millions
  of rural Malawians struggling with increasingly unpredictable rainfall and
  droughts made more ferocious by the climate crisis. The 61-year-old farmer was
  eager to talk and quick to smile. But his face fell when he saw the dry, empty
  land in the village of Kampheko 2, where he had grown tomatoes, garlic, okra
  and maize. “It hurts,” he said through an interpreter. “It’s a distressing
  sight because water is life. So without water nothing can exist.” Malawi is
  the world’s fourth poorest country per capita, according to the World Bank,
  with an average annual income of just $508 in 2024. More than 80% of the
  population works in agriculture and 90% of farming uses just rain without
  irrigation, according to the World Food Programme. That has made the
  landlocked southern African country particularly vulnerable to climate-fuelled
  disasters, including cyclones that have increased in intensity and frequency
  in recent years. In 2023, Cyclone Freddy killed more than 1,000 Malawians.
  Since 2019, about 950,000 people have been displaced by cyclones, most
  temporarily, some multiple times. In a programme started in 2020, the
  government has helped 1,662 households (about 8,300 people) living in
  disaster-prone areas to relocate permanently, according to figures provided by
  the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). The more gradual impacts
  of climate breakdown are also pushing people from their homes. Without
  concrete action, 216 million people worldwide could move internally by 2050
  “due to slow-onset climate change impacts”, 86 million of them in sub-Saharan
  Africa, the World Bank estimated in 2021. In 2023, African ministers signed a
  declaration on migration and the climate crisis, stating: “Migration can be a
  positive adaptation strategy if undertaken in a safe, orderly and regular
  manner.” But, it added that moving could exacerbate problems faced by already
  vulnerable groups. The World Bank forecasts for gradual climate migration did
  not include estimates for Malawi. But during a devastating drought last year,
  400,000 people moved within the country, according to IOM data. Average
  temperatures in Malawi between 2015 and 2024 were 0.63 degrees higher than a
  century earlier, the World Bank data says. The rising population is also
  adding pressure – Malawi’s population has more than doubled to 21.6 million in
  30 years. Local officials reported more people moving from southern Malawi to
  the north and centre of the country, said Master Simoni, who works for the IOM
  in the country. “As a result of the dry spells, we’ve seen that a lot of
  livelihood activities have been affected, be it farming, whether it’s crops or
  livestock, but also even casual labour,” he said. In a swath of the Mangochi
  and Ntcheu districts south of Lake Malawi, mud-walled villages were scattered
  off dirt tracks, amid scrubby trees and dried-up riverbeds. Small-scale
  farmers spoke about depleted water supplies and falling crop yields. There
  were also many who had moved, some multiple times. Chibonda moved to Kampheko
  2 in 2021 to access land, as his home village had matrilineal inheritance.
  Granted 0.6 hectares (1.5 acres) by local chiefs who split Kampheko in two in
  1982, he was attracted by the fertile soil and villagers growing rice, an
  especially thirsty crop. Chibonda relied on a borehole but the irrigated
  radius around it started shrinking even in the three years he lived there.
  Then, the borehole was destroyed by vandals in 2024. Yellowed grass now pokes
  out the broken concrete. On the other side of the village, at the bottom of a
  wide, dusty depression, 49-year-old Patricia Ngola scooped out dirty water
  from a hole populated by frogs and flies. Before 2020, the water hole could
  irrigate nearby fields, said the chief, John Sasamola. Many Malawians struggle
  to access water for household needs, let alone agriculture. In rural areas 37%
  of people walk more than 30 minutes to get water, compared with 13% in towns
  and cities, according to Unicef. In 2019, Unicef estimated $97m a year was
  needed to provide all Malawians with water within a half-hour walk by 2030 –
  the UN sustainable development goal (SDG) target year – with another $259m
  required annually for clean water in people’s homes. “Currently we are very
  far from that,” said Peter Phiri, Water Aid’s country director. In 2023,
  Unicef estimated spending had to quadruple to reach the SDG target. But, with
  recent US and other aid cuts, it could now be only one-sixth of the need,
  Phiri said. Next to Kampheko 2’s dusty water hole, Steria Fakson harvested
  sweet potatoes by hand. The 0.4-hectare plot would yield just three bags, the
  23-year-old said. Before she was born, it could produce enough to fill an
  oxcart, her step-grandmother Ngola told her. Fakson said she had not thought
  about moving, though: “I think I’ll wait for water.” Not the entrepreneurial
  Chibonda. In June 2024, he trekked 15 miles to Chiganji. He had heard about
  available land near a borehole installed by Water Aid for a school, but now
  used by the whole village. A month later he brought his wife and four
  children, whose ages now range from two to seven, to the new site (Chibonda
  also had eight children with his late first wife). However, villagers only
  allowed him to irrigate at night. That, and the meagre rainwater, still was
  not enough to fulfil Chibonda’s ambitions, which included creating fishponds.
  “I look at water as capital for business … But as I started seeing that the
  water supply there was no longer going to support my dreams, I decided to
  move,” he said. In January, Chibonda and his family migrated again. This time
  they moved 120 miles north-east to a 9 hectare (22 acre) plot, where water can
  be pumped from Lake Malawi about a mile away. Chibonda has planted sugarcane,
  bananas and cabbages and is targeting an orchard of 1,000 mango, orange and
  guava trees, as well as his much hankered-after fishponds. “For me, it’s the
  rain patterns,” he said, reflecting on the impact of the climate crisis. “That
  is why my vision has always been to find a water source that doesn’t rely on
  rain … In recent years, at the time when we all need rain, the rain does not
  come.” Gladys Khumbidzi first moved 22 years ago, because of repeated floods.
  Then, in her new home, the water supply got progressively worse. The shallow
  boreholes were drying up at the end of the November to April rainy season,
  sometimes as early as February. So, seven years ago, she moved again, to
  Chiganji. But, recently, Khumbidzi has struggled to grow enough to feed
  herself and her three grandchildren, their home being a 25-minute walk from
  the water pump. “In the first years, I could plant the vegetable gardens. But
  now … one year it will work, another year it will not work,” she said,
  recalling a year where the rain had not stopped – destroying her crops, and
  then last year, when the drought killed everything. Khumbidzi, who is in her
  mid-60s , said she was too old to move again: “As the elders say, a rolling
  stone gathers no moss. I feel that I have rolled enough in my life. If I die,
  I will die right here.”
