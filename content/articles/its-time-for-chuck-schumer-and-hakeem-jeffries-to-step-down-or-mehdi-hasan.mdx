  In a recent podcast conversation, the former spokesperson for Jeb Bush sat
  down with the leader of the House Democrats. Guess which one of them endorsed
  the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York? “I was a Republican up until
  two minutes ago and I’m a capitalist, and I had Zohran on ... it’s not really
  a close call, is it?” Tim Miller said to Hakeem Jeffries on his Bulwark
  podcast, to which a defensive-sounding House Minority leader replied: “What I
  can say is that he’s the only one I’m scheduled to talk to.” Time and time
  again, Jeffries has refused to endorse his own party’s official candidate for
  mayor in his own city, two months after Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic
  mayoral primary in New York by double digits – including Jeffries’ own
  congressional district by eight points. This is the same Democratic party
  leader who has insisted in the past that progressives should “vote BLUE (no
  matter who)”. But centrists? Apparently, they’re under no such obligation.
  Jeffries is not alone in his brazen hypocrisy. Chuck Schumer, the Senate
  Minority leader who represents the state of New York and lives in the city of
  New York, has also refused to endorse his own party’s official candidate for
  mayor of New York. If you want to understand why the Democrats are polling at
  their lowest point for more than three decades, look no further than these two
  uninspiring Democratic leaders in Congress. If you want to understand why 62%
  of Democratic voters say “the leadership of the Democratic party should be
  replaced with new people,” again, look no further than Jeffries and Schumer.
  Week after week, month after month, they embarrass themselves, undermine their
  colleagues and demoralize their voters. Theirs is a record of cowardice and
  capitulation. Let’s start with Jeffries. In February, the hapless House
  Minority leader wondered aloud: “I’m trying to figure out what leverage we
  actually have. They control the House, the Senate. And the presidency. It’s
  their government. What leverage do we have?” It was a shrug of impotence; a
  sign of pre-emptive submission only weeks after Trump’s inauguration. That
  same month, just days before Bernie Sanders began his “Fighting Oligarchy”
  tour in front of packed arenas across the country, Jeffries “quietly met with
  more than 150 Silicon Valley-based donors … in tony Los Altos Hills,” reported
  Politico, in order to “mend fences” with the billionaire Big Tech bosses. In
  April, when Democratic members of Congress such as Senator Chris Van Hollen
  and Representative Maxwell Frost were visiting El Salvador and raising the
  issue of Kilmar Ábrego Garcia’s detention, the Bulwark reported: “The minority
  leader has discouraged further excursions to the country” (reporting that
  Jeffries later denied). Subsequent polling suggests those trips helped change
  public opinion on immigration and, especially, on the fate of Ábrego Garcia.
  Jeffries, though, can claim no credit for that shift in American sentiment. In
  June, in the wake of the Trump administration’s decision to file ludicrous
  charges of assault against Democratic congresswoman LaMonica McIver after a
  protest outside an immigration detention center, the dead-eyed Jeffries
  appeared on CNN with host Dana Bash. BASH: You previously warned that the
  administration charging members of Congress was a, quote, ‘red line’. What are
  you doing now that the red line you talked about has apparently been crossed?
  JEFFRIES: We will make that decision in a time, place and manner of our
  choosing. But the response will be continuous, and it will meet the moment
  that is required. BASH: What exactly does that mean? Have you not decided how
  to respond? JEFFRIES: We will respond in a time, place, and manner of our
  choosing if this continues to happen. Bash looked bewildered. And we’re now
  coming up to three months since Jeffries made those bizarre, tone-deaf
  remarks. Has the time not arrived yet? Has he still not found the place? Last
  month, Jeffries refused, again, to endorse Mamdani but then went further,
  telling CNBC that Andrew Cuomo’s baseless attack on Mamdani’s rent-stablized
  apartment was a “legitimate issue” and that his campaign was “going to have to
  address it”. Can you imagine a Republican leader in Congress going on live
  television to throw their party’s mayoral candidate under the bus in this way?
  Jeffries has become almost a parody of a weak, spineless Democratic leader.
  When he was asked recently about Trump’s fascistic deployment of troops to the
  streets of Washington DC, his response was to praise the DC attorney general’s
  “strongly-worded letter”. Well, you know who else likes to bring a
  “strongly-worded letter” to a gunfight with Republicans? Yep. You guessed it.
  Chuck Schumer. The Senate Minority leader bragged to CNN earlier this year
  about how he had reacted to Donald Trump’s attack on US universities by
  sending him “a very strong letter just the other day”. To be clear: Schumer’s
  record on resisting Trump and fighting back against his authoritarian takeover
  of the US government has been as feeble and feckless as Jeffries’. Remember
  that cringe chant of ‘We will win’ and ‘We won’t rest’ that he led outside the
  Treasury building in February, as Elon Musk’s Doge teams rampaged through the
  federal government? Or when he shamefully backed down from a confrontation
  with Trump over a government shutdown in March and earned the scathing
  soubriquet “Surrender Schumer”? (One anonymous House Democrat joked at the
  time that the Senate Minority leader’s popularity was “hovering somewhere
  between Elon Musk and the Ebola virus”.) How about when he told NPR that same
  month that accusing Israel of genocide – now the view of 77% of Democratic
  voters – was antisemitic, or when he declared to neoconservative Brett
  Stephens that his job was “to keep the left pro-Israel”? Who can forget also
  his hawkish denunciation of “Taco Trump” in June for not being “tough” enough
  on the “terrorist government” of Iran, just weeks before Trump illegally
  bombed Iran? It makes no sense to me that Schumer is still the leader of the
  Democrats in the Senate. The party lost the upper chamber on his watch, under
  his leadership, but Schumer chose to stay on and his colleagues let him. But
  when you lead your party to defeat in an election, shouldn’t you … lose your
  job? As for Jeffries, the Democrats may win back the House of Representatives
  next November on the back of an anti-Trump wave, but what then? What vision
  will a Speaker Jeffries offer? What resistance will he provide to the wannabe
  dictator in the White House? What actual plan does he have to preserve and
  protect democracy in 2028? Since Trump was inaugurated for a second time in
  January, Jeffries and Schumer have demonstrated time and again that they are
  not built for this particular moment. While Trump seeds the ground for an
  American dictatorship, these two top Dems pine for bipartisanship. While
  millions of rank-and-file Democrats across the country say they want leaders
  who will fight, Jeffries and Schumer fold. While younger Democrats like
  Mamdani and AOC offer energy and charisma, these two lackluster leaders in the
  House and Senate offer cringe chants and even cringier photo-ops. It is past
  time for both Jeffries and Schumer to step down and step aside. This fascist
  moment, this age of Trump, demands outspoken, unrelenting, and fearless
  opposition. Whether you are a Democrat, or simply a democrat, we all deserve
  better. Mehdi Hasan is the founder, CEO and editor-in-chief of the media
