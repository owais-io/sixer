  Despite a once bitter rivalry that dates to before the Spanish Armada in 1588,
  pupils in England are studying español in greater numbers than ever before,
  with it overtaking French as the most popular language for GCSEs. The rise of
  Spanish in schools has long been predicted, helped by the popularity of
  holidays in Spain and the Canary Islands and its greater global reach. More
  recently its popularity has been turbo-charged by cultural influences through
  music, cinema and much of the US media, with an added attraction for young
  football fans thanks to superstars such as Lionel Messi of Argentina and the
  success of La Liga clubs including Real Madrid. The British Council said there
  had been a sustained rise of nearly 25% in Spanish GCSE entries since 2020.
  This year there were more than 136,000 entries, just ahead of French, the
  perennial modern foreign languages champion, with fewer than 133,000. Jevan
  Sathyamoorthy, a student at Wallington County grammar school in the London
  borough of Sutton, said he had opted to take Spanish over French at GCSE
  because it seemed more immediately practical. “I chose Spanish because I
  remember thinking it’s more likely that I’ll be going to a Spanish-speaking
  country than a French-speaking one, with most of Latin America and the
  Caribbean as well as Spain, so I’d say that was the biggest reason,”
  Sathyamoorthy said. “And in my mind Spanish seemed easier, because the way its
  words were pronounced came more easily to me than French when I’d done a bit
  of both in primary school.” As Spanish has risen, some other once-popular
  modern languages have had a marked decline, including German, where GCSE
  entries have fallen by more than 20% since 2020. Vicky Gough, the British
  Council’s schools adviser, said: “We need the success of Spanish reflected
  across all languages through exchanges, cultural programmes and real-world
  connections that demonstrate why languages matter. “Our research also reveals
  a significant socioeconomic gap: pupils in the top fifth of the most
  advantaged state schools in England are around 32% more likely to take a
  language GCSE than their peers elsewhere, meaning many young people from less
  privileged backgrounds miss out on opportunities their peers benefit from. “At
  a time of increasing global tension, helping young people connect across
  borders, build friendships and foster trust has never been more important.”
  The British Council said a number of other modern foreign languages had risen
  in popularity for the fifth year in a row, including Arabic, Chinese, Polish
  and Urdu.
