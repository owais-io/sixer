  Mabel, 33 The safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too,
  and we can explore freely When Finn and I met on a dating app last year, I was
  enjoying being single. So when he asked me to be his girlfriend one month in,
  I wasn’t sure at first. But I was sure about him, and I liked how he’d phrased
  it (“I know you’re having fun, and I don’t want to put pressure on you”), with
  my freedom being a positive thing. My ex-boyfriend was jealous and controlling
  and wanted to keep me in a box. He felt threatened that I had exes and had had
  sex with others. He hated me staying out late and questioned why I put on nice
  underwear for work, suspecting that must mean I was sleeping with a colleague.
  So it was refreshing to be with someone who celebrated my sexuality. The
  safety I feel with Finn means the sex we have feels safe, too, and we can
  explore freely. We experiment with power dynamics, and I find the danger
  exciting, but it never feels like Finn is dominant in an uncaring way. He once
  said, “I don’t want to act too dominant in case you think I don’t love you,”
  which I thought was very romantic. I’ve heard that there are two ways of
  experiencing desire. Some people can just be doing the washing up and want to
  have sex – that’s Finn. The other is becoming turned on once you start being
  intimate – that’s me. So Finn is usually the one to initiate sex, but I always
  want it. He’s playful – he’ll put his hands down my pants when we’re out! He
  once fingered me in a car while driving down a winding road, and when cyclists
  overtook us, it was thrilling. We’ve both said past relationships were things
  that just happened to us, whereas we’ve chosen each other. It has surprised us
  both how open we are. When we were on holiday last year, we spent the whole
  time talking about how lucky we are. We’re about to move in together, and I
  can’t wait to do boring, domestic, adult things with him all the time.
  Yesterday, we went to the butcher and B&amp;Q, and even that was fun. When I’m
  with Finn, everything feels like an adventure. Finn, 33 Our sex life has
  become more adventurous. We’ve had sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo
  booth I wanted a break from dating apps and was about to delete them when I
  started speaking to Mabel. After our first date, we went back to hers and had
  great sex, but we had to be quiet because her flatmate was next door, so Mabel
  covered my mouth with her hand. Usually, she’s quite vocal, which turns me on.
  On our second date, I cooked for her at mine, which felt like a big gesture. I
  was seeing other people casually, but it felt different with Mabel; it was so
  easy. Even though I wanted to say, “Let’s see each other loads,” we played it
  cool. We have sex every time we see each other, about four times a week, which
  hasn’t decreased since we’ve been together. Our sex life has become more
  adventurous, and we’ve done things neither of us has done before. We’ve had
  sex in the sea, in a field, in a photo booth. I used to worry about someone
  seeing us, and Mabel would tease me about being cautious, but now I suggest it
  too. In previous relationships, even if the sex was good, I’d doubt how
  compatible we were. I’d seek novelty, and I still do, but Mabel offers me
  that. We’ve settled into more of a routine, but it still feels exciting. Maybe
  I’ve worked out what I want, or it could be our relationship is more
  interesting than my previous ones. My relationships have never lasted longer
  than two years, and I’ve avoided conversations about marriage and kids. When I
  was 21, I had a toxic relationship and a messy break-up, where I cheated, and
  my partner became possessive and insecure, which affected my ability to commit
  to others. But Mabel and I speak about spending the rest of our lives
  together. Maybe it’s the age we met at – we don’t need to wait. It’s the best
  sex of my life, and the possibility of having that for ever makes me feel very
  lucky.
