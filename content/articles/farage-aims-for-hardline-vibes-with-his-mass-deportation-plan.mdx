  Halfway into his press conference on Tuesday – during which he announced his
  party would deport asylum seekers en masse if it entered government – Nigel
  Farage sounded a note of triumphalism. “One of the most interesting things
  about this press conference … is the questions being asked are about the
  practicalities of individual pieces of implementation,” he said. “What I
  notice is there is very little pushback from the media against the idea that
  we really are in very, very big trouble in this country.” At the heart of the
  Reform leader’s speech was a political gamble. In the past, Farage has been
  sparing in his use of hardline rhetoric around migration, cautious not to get
  too close to the arguments of the far right. On Tuesday, however, he cut
  loose, describing irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge”,
  referring to men who cross the Channel repeatedly as being of “fighting age”,
  and saying: “We are not far away from major civil disorder.” With his party 10
  points ahead in the polls, Farage has been facing a dilemma over whether to
  lean into his image as a firebrand rightwing populist or to try to appear more
  statesmanlike in an attempt to position himself for Downing Street. Gawain
  Towler, his former head of communications, said: “Farage should not be seen as
  a street-fighting man. He plans to govern for the whole country and needs to
  be seen in that light.” Some in Reform described Tuesday’s speech in a similar
  light, saying it constituted the kind of thought-through policy proposal that
  voters would seek in a party of government. Others, however, argue Farage’s
  own answers to detailed policy questions showed he was more interested in the
  politics of the plan than whether it could work. Asked by the Guardian for
  example why he had costed his plan at £10bn, when the Centre for Migration
  Control had estimated a near-identical plan would cost £47.5bn, Farage said
  dismissively: “Zia [Yusuf, his Reform colleague] is really good at maths.” The
  gamble for the Reform leader, say experts, lies less in whether the public
  care about such policy details and more about whether they agree with Farage’s
  argument that the validity of a person’s asylum claim matters less than how
  they entered the country. Joe Twyman, the co-founder of the polling company
  Deltapoll, said: “About one in six people endorse very strong views on legal
  or settled migrants, and that number hasn’t really changed. “What Farage is
  doing is tapping into a longstanding but still relatively small minority. The
  reason he’s doing this is for the vibes – he wants people to hear a hardline
  message on migration and thinks most people won’t care about the detail.”
  Sunder Katwala, the director of the thinktank British Future, said: “Between a
  fifth and a quarter have no sympathy for people crossing the Channel – thats
  Farage’s core vote. “Another fifth are ‘team compassion’, but most are in
  between: they want control but also care whether an asylum seeker’s claim is
  justified.” Farage was quickly proved correct, however, in one respect. While
  journalists were willing to ask tough questions about the fundamental tenets
  of Reform’s plan, Downing Street seemed less willing to. Asked by reporters
  whether Keir Starmer had moral misgivings about Farage’s speech or the
  language he used, a spokesperson replied: “We totally recognise the concerns
  that the British people have with the surge in illegal migration … but we are
  focused on taking forward the practical actions and solutions that will deal
  with it.” The Conservatives were even more reluctant to criticise the Reform
  leader. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, accused Farage of “reheating
  and recycling plans that the Conservatives have already announced”. Labour and
  the Tories have found it difficult to respond to public concern about the
  levels of legal and illegal migration. But some say the tendency of the
  government in particular to accept the premise of Reform’s arguments and argue
  about implementation carries its own risks. “Farage is OK – in a three-way
  split he might be able to get a minority government on 26%-27%,” said Katwala.
  “Starmer, however, can only hold his coalition of voters together if he talks
  about control and compassion. “If Labour is completely on the fence, it risks
  not keeping either side happy.”
