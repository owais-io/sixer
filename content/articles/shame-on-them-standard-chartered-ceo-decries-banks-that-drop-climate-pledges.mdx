  ‘Shame on them’: Standard Chartered CEO decries banks that drop climate
  pledges

  The chief executive of Standard Chartered has condemned rival banks that have
  dropped their climate commitments amid mounting political pressure. Speaking
  to journalists on Thursday, Bill Winters criticised banks that had jumped on
  the climate bandwagon when it was “fashionable”, but had since rolled back on
  their green ambitions or gone quiet on the subject. “Shame on them,” he said,
  without naming individual firms. His comments came weeks after HSBC became the
  first UK-headquartered bank to leave the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance
  (NZBA), in a further blow to international climate coordination efforts. The
  UN environment programme’s finance initiative, which is led by banks, commits
  members to aligning their lending, investment and capital markets activities
  with net zero emissions by 2050 or earlier. HSBC was one of the founding
  members of the NZBA, which was launched in 2021. At the time, Noel Quinn, the
  bank’s then chief executive, said industry-wide collaboration was “essential
  to monitoring progress” towards net zero. The decision to leave the initiative
  came months after HSBC revealed it would delay key parts of its climate goals
  for the next 20 years, and water down other environmental targets, as part of
  a long-term bonus plan for Quinn’s successor, Georges Elhedery, who took over
  last year. It also followed a wave of exits from the NZBA by big US banks
  including JP Morgan, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman
  Sachs during the run-up to Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Trump’s
  second term has sparked a wide-ranging climate backlash from rightwing
  politicians, who have been emboldened by his anti-green push for higher oil
  and gas production. On Thursday, Winters said: “People that said a lot of
  stuff, but [when] it was fashionable to say it, [and] who are saying either
  nothing or the opposite now: shame on them.” He said most of Standard
  Chartered’s clients – from across China, India, wider Asia and the Middle East
  – were “as focused on their net zero transitions, or their transitions to low
  carbon economy, as they were before. And that obviously is good for business.”
  “A lot of these projects just make sense economically,” Winters added. “Most
  continue to honour the obligations that they made to their shareholders or
  other stakeholders early on, independent of political noise one way or the
  other.” During HSBC’s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Elhedery said
  the decision to drop its NZBA membership was “not cost related”. He added that
  HSBC remained “fully committed in our ambition to become a net-zero bank by
  2050” and was undertaking a review of interim targets for 2030, which would
  conclude in the second half of this year.
