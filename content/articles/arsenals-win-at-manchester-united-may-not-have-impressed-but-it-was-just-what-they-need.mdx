  Arsenal’s win at Manchester United may not have impressed, but it was just
  what they need

  There was a thought at times in the second part of last season, when the
  set-piece goals dried up, that Arsenal had become over-reliant on them. And
  perhaps that was true, but they’re a useful weapon to have. Some games are won
  by overwhelming opponents through superior technical ability and some games
  are won by organization and hard work, by finding a way to score and a way to
  keep their opponent out. Arsenal’s 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Sunday was
  definitely one of the latter. Manchester United do not defend inswinging
  corners well. Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka both excel at taking inswinging
  corners. In that sense, the fact that the game was decided by United
  goalkeeper Altay Bayindir’s flap at a Rice inswinger was entirely to be
  expected. What was less predictable was the nature of the game that followed
  as United hit the post and David Raya was called into seven saves. Mikel
  Arteta, quite reasonably, praised his side’s “character and spirit” while
  acknowledging they had made “mistakes that are very far from the standards
  that we normally have.” It’s not that Arsenal were fortunate or that they
  somehow didn’t deserve to win, if that is a concept with any meaning; rather
  it was the thought that against a more coherent or incisive side than United,
  they will need to play rather better. Winning without playing well, though,
  has not often been the Arsenal way recently; in that sense, there was perhaps
  encouragement to be drawn from the hard-earned nature of the three points.
  That they will surely do. A certain rustiness in the opening game is only
  natural, particularly with new players to integrate. Viktor Gyökeres will
  adjust at least to an extent to the pace of the game. Martin Zubimendi looked
  appalled that the swinging arm with which Bryan Mbeumo caught him early on
  wasn’t penalized, but he will surely learn to handle the knocks and bumps and
  flailing limbs of English football. Arteta acknowledged it would take both
  time to get up to speed but pronounced himself satisfied with how they had
  played. The “mistakes” will be ironed out. A degree of fluency will return.
  But until then, it’s good to have the set-plays. Arsenal have scored 31 times
  from corners since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, at least 11 more than
  any other side in the Premier League. That’s a valuable weapon to have,
  particularly for a team that has so regularly been criticized for having to
  dominate a game to win it. In that sense, the win at Old Trafford was a little
  like Arsenal’s victory over Aston Villa in their first away game of last
  season, a game chiefly notable for an extraordinary double save from Raya.
  Praise them for getting the result without playing especially well, for
  showing what in hindsight might be regarded as the grit of champions, or
  question why they didn’t play especially well? The answer to that will only
  become apparent as the season goes on. Arsenal, though, probably can take
  comfort and more than a degree of satisfaction from having beaten United away.
  True, nine sides did that last season, but Ruben Amorim’s side surely won’t be
  as bad this campaign as they were then. Old Trafford may again become a
  difficult place to go, as United’s squad settles and the impact of not having
  to play European football comes to be felt; having got the game against them
  out of the way early may end up being fortunate. Of the four realistic title
  contenders, Arsenal had the hardest start and without excelling have three
  points on the board, which is more than can be said of Chelsea after their 0-0
  draw with Crystal Palace. The world champions have a hugely gifted squad,
  particularly in forward areas but, with Benoît Badiashile, Wesley Fofana and
  Levi Colwill all suffering long-term injuries, look a little short at the
  back, while doubts persist about Robert Sánchez. The goalkeeper was perhaps
  fortunate that VAR ruled out Eberechi Eze’s free kick that flew past him, but
  the bigger issue on Sunday was the lack of creativity. Upgrading from Nicolas
  Jackson at centre-forward has not proved an instant panacea. Manchester City
  were the most impressive of the contenders on opening weekend, with the new
  signing in midfield Tijjani Reijnders starring in the 4-0 win at Wolves. Given
  the sort of space Wolves afforded them, they will cut teams apart but the
  openness they exhibited at times last season and again in the Club World Cup
  has not gone away; better sides than Wolves may be able to exploit that.
  Liverpool looked at least as open in their 4-2 win over Bournemouth and, like
  Arsenal, were left grateful for their resilience as they scored twice after
  the 88th minute to secure the three points. They too have work to do in
  balancing the side and integrating new signings. None of the probable top four
  were at anything like their best. All will find a greater cohesion as the
  season goes on. But Arsenal have got one of the trickier away games out of the
  way. This is an extract from Soccer with Jonathan Wilson, a weekly look from
