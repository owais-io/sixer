  Toyota has warned it faces a 1.4tn yen (£7.1bn) hit from Donald Trump’s trade
  tariffs, as the Japanese company reported a drop in net profit and cut its
  guidance for next year. The biggest carmaker in the world said it expected to
  make an operating profit of 3.2tn yen in its financial year to March 2026,
  down 16% on previous guidance of 3.8tn yen. The anticipated annual hit from US
  tariffs includes the impact of the levies on car imports, higher material
  prices and a stronger yen. The figures were reported as the latest wave of
  country-specific tariffs came into force, with dozens of countries facing
  higher taxes on their exports to the US. This includes Japan, whose baseline
  rate rose from 10% to 15% under the terms of a framework agreed between Tokyo
  and Washington last month. Under the deal, Japanese automotive exports to the
  US are to face a 15% tariff, down from previous sector-specific levies that
  added up to 27.5%. The timeframe for when the change comes into effect has yet
  to be announced. Toyota’s operating profit fell by almost 11% to 1.17tn yen in
  the three months to the end of June compared with the same period last year.
  Its figures came a day after the rival Japanese carmaker Honda reported a 50%
  drop in profit in the same quarter, to 244bn yen. That was mainly because of a
  124bn-yen hit from US tariffs, the company said. The global car industry has
  been one of the hardest hit by Trump’s trade wars. The sector accounts for 8%
  of jobs in Japan, with vehicles and automotive parts making up more than a
  quarter of all the countries exports to the US. As part of last month’s
  bilateral deal, Trump said Japan would invest $550bn (£410bn) in the US. The
  president also claimed that Japan would open its market to US products such as
  cars, trucks, rice and certain agricultural products. Despite the trade
  turmoil, Toyota reported record sales in the first half of the year, up 5.5%
  to 5.1m vehicles, supported by demand for hybrid cars. Shares in the company,
  however, have dropped by more than 10% this year over tariff uncertainty.
  Trump’s latest wave of country-specific tariffs that came into force on
  Thursday include rates of more than 40% on imports from Syria, Laos and
  Myanmar, down to 15% for the EU and 10% for the UK. The “reciprocal” levies
  announced by the White House a week ago – before a previous 1 August deadline
  was due to elapse – came into effect a minute past midnight Washington time on
  Thursday.
