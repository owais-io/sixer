  Sylvia Young, who has died aged 85, nurtured the childhood talents of some of
  British show business’s biggest names, from singers such as Amy Winehouse,
  Rita Ora and the Spice Girl Emma Bunton to the actors Keeley Hawes and Billie
  Piper. She opened the Sylvia Young theatre school in central London in 1981
  and, during its first decade, provided the newly launched BBC soap EastEnders
  with stars including Adam Woodyatt, Letitia Dean, Nick Berry and Danniella
  Westbrook. She also trained young performers who went straight into featured
  roles on the West End stage, such as Denise van Outen in Les Miserables and
  Nicola Stapleton (later of EastEnders) in Aspects of Love. Then, in 1994, when
  the director Sam Mendes auditioned 3,000 children for his revival of Oliver!
  at the London Palladium, he found five of the six juvenile leads and almost
  half of the other young cast members, among Young’s “babies”, as she called
  them. Although her classes included males such as Matt Willis, of the pop
  group Busted, and the actors Steven Mackintosh and John Pickard, many of those
  who went on to find success were female. “We produce girls with bottle,” said
  Young, who survived a tough upbringing in London’s East End. “We develop
  confidence.” The Sylvia Young theatre school opened with 27 pupils and became
  one of a small band of performing arts establishments offering full-time
  courses to those aged between 10 and 16. It grew to accommodate more than 200
  pupils, along with a staff of 20, providing both training as performers and an
  academic education from qualified teachers. Monday to Wednesday were spent on
  standard school lessons, while Thursday and Friday were reserved for the
  performing arts. “My aim was to prove that coming to a stage school would not
  be detrimental to a child’s general education,” said Young. Dean Gaffney, who
  joined EastEnders in 1993, recalled that the end of each week “turned into a
  complete Fame school, with people singing down the hallways and tracksuits
  instead of school uniform”. Saturday and summer classes were also established,
  as well as two affiliated agencies to seek work: Young ’Uns for pupils and
  Rossmore Management for others over 16. Providing places for those on
  scholarships and bursaries was important to Young, who said: “I’ve never
  wanted it to be purely for children of the wealthy.” She encouraged her
  charges to learn talents across the board – singing, dancing and acting – and
  to consider associated jobs such as casting agents, camera operators or
  writers. Other graduates of the school include Naomi Campbell, Samantha Janus,
  Kellie Bright, Nicholas Hoult, Dani Behr, the singer Dua Lipa, three members
  of the girl band All Saints and the casting director Paul de Freitas, as well
  as Adele Silva, Sheree Murphy and Isabel Hodgins, who all joined the ITV soap
  Emmerdale. Contrary to some reports, Winehouse was not expelled, said Young,
  who told the Guardian in 2022 that the future singing sensation was “very
  clever” but “very naughty”, finding the academic work too easy and becoming
  bored. “I liked her tremendously.” Young was born Sylvia Bakal in Whitechapel,
  east London. Her mother, Sophie (nee Wexler), was of Romanian heritage, while
  her father, Abraham, who served in the 17th/21st Lancers, had parents from
  Belgium and Romania, After the second world war he worked as a tailor’s
  presser, then owned a betting shop. Evacuated to live with a mining family in
  a village outside Barnsley in 1943, Sylvia returned to London after the war to
  be brought up, the eldest of nine children, in a three-bedroom council flat.
  Finding peace at her local library, she read hundreds of plays as a child. On
  leaving Skinners’ Company school, Stamford Hill, in north London, at 16 she
  took a clerical job before working for Stoke Newington Libraries (1956-57),
  then – despite suffering stage fright – acting with the amateur repertory
  company at Mountview Theatre Club (1957-65). She became a stay-at-home mother
  following the births of her two daughters by Norman Ruffell, whom she married
  in 1961. Helping to stage a fundraising show for her girls’ primary school,
  Aldersbrook, in 1972 led her to create its Young ’Uns company, performing
  old-time music-hall routines for charity. When pupils started to call her
  Sylvia Young-un, she adopted the name. From 1973 she ran a singing and drama
  group in Manor Park, east London, before setting up a Saturday school six
  years later in the Notre Dame de France church near Leicester Square. In 1980
  this moved to the premises of a boys’ club in Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and
  became the Sylvia Young theatre school the following year. A relocation to
  Marylebone shortly afterwards was followed in 2010 by a move to Marble Arch.
  Among Young’s pupils over the years was her own elder daughter, Frances
  Ruffelle, whom she expelled for bad behaviour. “I was 15 years old, a wayward
  teenager who talked back, and my mother decided she couldn’t teach me,” said
  Ruffelle, who went on to star in West End musicals such as Les Miserables and
  Chicago. Young’s other daughter, Alison, also acted, ran Rossmore Management
  and eventually became managing director of the school in 2015. Young was made
  OBE in 2005 and won a special recognition Olivier award in 2022. Her husband
  and children survive her, along with four grandchildren, the pop singer Eliza
  Doolittle, Nat, Felix and Coral. • Sylvia Young (Sylvia Bakal), stage school
  principal, born 18 September 1939; died 30 July 2025 • This article was
  amended on 2 August 2025 to correct the first name of Paul de Freitas.
