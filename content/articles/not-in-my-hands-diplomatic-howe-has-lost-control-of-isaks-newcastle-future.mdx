  As a player at Bournemouth and Portsmouth Eddie Howe could invariably be found
  reading the foreign news pages of the broadsheets while travelling to matches
  on the team bus. More than two decades on, the Newcastle manager’s ability to
  construct carefully worded sentences loaded with calibrated between-the-lines
  subtext make it easy to imagine him as some sort of international envoy. This
  skill set dictates that few Premier League counterparts can be better equipped
  to confront a problem such as Alexander Isak. Yet, behind a resolutely brave
  face, even Newcastle’s manager acknowledges, albeit tacitly, that he has lost
  control of the situation. The Sweden striker is so keen to force through a
  move to Liverpool that he has, in effect, gone on strike. After resisting
  overtures to be reintegrated with the squad, Isak continues to train alone
  and, it is understood, will shortly be fined the maximum permissible two
  weeks’ wages for making himself unavailable for Saturday’s season opener at
  Aston Villa. “I’ve said many times I want Alex to train and play,” Howe said
  on Friday. “I’ve had those conversations with him.” Pressed on whether Isak
  could rejoin the squad before the end of this month, he shrugged. “I don’t
  know,” he said. “Alex will control that.” So how did it come to this? Isak,
  disgruntled at not receiving the pay rise he believed he had been promised
  during the summer of 2024, left plenty of clues about his mindset last season.
  In an BBC interview with Alan Shearer last winter and then before the Carabao
  Cup final the 25-year-old was noncommittal, to say the least, about his
  future. It would be inconceivable to think a manager as tuned-in as Howe would
  not have second-guessed his leading scorer’s disillusion. In perhaps the most
  revealing moment of Friday’s press conference he was asked whether, when
  Newcastle sealed Champions League qualification in May, he was confident of
  Isak fulfilling the three remaining years on his contract. “I was not thinking
  of any individual in that moment, so I can’t really give an answer on that,”
  he said. Then came a query as to why Newcastle had acted as if blind to Isak’s
  unhappiness and potential for disruptive behaviour in June. Had they placed
  the striker on the market then, an auction would surely have unfolded. There
  would also have been more alternative attacking options for the board to
  pursue. “I understand why you might think that,” said Howe. “But no situation
  is ever as simple as it seems on the outside.” It rather provokes the question
  as to whether he had embraced reality while Newcastle’s Saudi Arabian owners
  remained in denial and believed they could keep Isak for at least another
  year. Technically they can, but unhappy players do not make for harmonious,
  let alone winning, teams. Howe said of Isak, among other things, skipping the
  pre-season tour of Singapore and South Korea: “I don’t think it has been
  healthy for us. I don’t deny that’s been a big challenge. Alex, for me, is one
  of the best strikers in the world, if not the best. To miss him from your
  squad leaves a huge gap. “Morale was certainly affected early on during
  pre-season. It was a difficult period for us. There was nothing I could do to
  affect that. “When you have a player that good who is not part of your group
  it’s difficult for the other players to fully understand it and to know how to
  react. “But there’s been an acceptance we have to make the best of the
  situation; the atmosphere within the group has been very good in the last
  couple of weeks. I can’t look you in the eye and say it’s brought us closer
  together, but, sometimes, these things can unify you in a way you didn’t know
  possible.” For all Isak’s rich attacking talent the road to reintegration is
  perilous. “I don’t think you can achieve anything with a squad that’s not
  totally united and keen to represent the club,” said Howe, pointedly. “In
  order for any player to play well you have to be in that mental place where
  you want to play. The league’s so hard that, if you’re not there, the games
  can become very difficult, very quickly.” The problem is that unless Liverpool
  make an offer somewhere nearer Newcastle’s £150m valuation of Isak than the
  £110m they have had rejected, the club is unlikely to sanction a sale.
  Liverpool are not expected to bid again until Newcastle sign at least one
  replacement. A deal for Brentford’s Yoane Wissa is close, but, for the moment,
  Howe is without a specialist striker. He will field a winger, Anthony Gordon,
  out of position at centre-forward against Villa. “Alex’s situation’s not in my
  hands,” he said before turning typically diplomatic. “But I’ll go with
  whatever hand I’m dealt.”
