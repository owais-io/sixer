  The price of oil is dropping this morning, on predictions that the Opec+ group
  could increase production again. Opec+ are due to meet on Sunday when they
  will consider whether to agree another increase in output targets. OPEC+ had
  already agreed to raise output targets by about 2.2 million barrels per day
  from April to September, plus a 300,000 bpd quota increase for the United Arab
  Emirates. The possibility of a further increase to supply has pushed Brent
  crude down by around 1% this morning, to below $67 per barrel. UK long-term
  borrowing costs have fallen a little this morning, as the bond market panic
  eases. The yield, or interest rate, on 30-year gilts has dipped by two basis
  points (0.02 percentage points) to 5.58% this morning. Last night they closed
  at 5.6%, having hit a 27-year high of 5.75% on Wednesday morning. Budget
  airline Jet2 has spooked the travel industry this morning, by predicting
  weaker earning growth than expected. Jet2 told investors that it expects its
  earnings, on an EBIT basis, to be towards the lower end of the analysts’
  consensus range. It also cautioned that it has “limited visibility” about
  prospects for this year, as holidaymakers are making bookings later, meaning
  it still has much of its winter seat capacity still to sell. Steve Heapy,
  Jet2’s chief executive officer, says: “Although we are currently operating in
  a difficult market, we have a proven business model, a loyal customer base, a
  flexible approach to capacity management and of course our multi award-winning
  customer service. We believe that these factors provide the foundation for a
  solid financial result this year and for further profitable growth in the
  years to come.” Shares in Jet2 tumbled 23% at the start of trading, and are
  now dow 14%. Other airlines are suffering too – easyJet have fallen by 4.2%,
  while British Airways’ parent company IAG has lost 2.3%. European stock
  markets have opened calmly too. In London, the FTSE 100 share index is down by
  just 3 points (-0.04%) at 9174, following some choppy sessions which saw
  losses on Tuesday and a partial recovery on Wednesday. Germany’s DAX dipped by
  0.27% at the open in Frankfurt. Signs of calm in the bond market will be
  warmly welcomed in the UK Treasury. The jump in Britain’s bond yields risks
  widening the ‘black hole’ which Rachel Reeves is expected to fill in the
  autumn budget scheduled for 26 November. That could mean either spending cuts
  or tax rises to persuade the Office for Budget Responsibility that the
  chancellor is keeping within the fiscal rules. Simon French, chief economist
  at Panmure Liberum, arugues that UK fiscal and monetary policymakers must
  demonstrate “a firm hand on the tiller” in the next few weeks, to help sooth
  UK gilt yields. He writes: Coordination of these policymakers will be key, and
  we are modestly encouraged by Treasury language subtly shifting to the task of
  controlling inflation. Saying it though is the easy bit. Making the tough
  decisions to enable it is far harder. The jury is out on whether the UK
  government - and its backbenchers - have the backbone, and the Gilt market
  knows it. French also flags that since the government’s Spring Statement
  earlier this year, the UK’s ten-year yield has been the highest in the G7,
  “the longest such outlier run in modern market history”: That suggests that
  domestic factors, as well as global concerns, have ben pushing up UK bond
  yields. There is a sense of calm in European and US markets today, reports
  Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, as the recovery in global bond
  yields on Wednesday helps sentiment. Brooks writes: There are signs that the
  bond market rout could be over. Global government bond sales have been strong
  this week and have not been impacted by bond market volatility. Added to this,
  some governments including the UK’s are talking once more about public sector
  spending cuts, which may boost demand for Gilts in the short term. Risks are
  still looming for the bond market, for example, Monday’s confidence vote in
  the French government. If the government collapses, then French bonds will be
  in the spotlight. Ahead today, there is a massive $11bn auction of French
  government debt. We will be watching this closely to gauge demand and to see
  if political turmoil impacts demand. That auction is scheduled for 10am UK
  time…. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s trade wars are another factor hitting
  bond prices this week. Last Friday’s court ruling that Trump’s tariffs are
  illegal has raised the prospect that the White House might have to refund
  billions of dollars paid by Americans on imported goods, as well as losing out
  on future revenues. As the White House has been, ahem, trumpeting the rising
  income from tariffs, that would be a blow. The prospect that America might
  need to borrow even more money to cover for a tariff shortfall could have
  weighed on bond prices this week, pushing up yields. Overnight, Trump asked
  the US Supreme Court to uphold his global tariffs on a fast-track schedule.
  This means the nine members of the Court will now have the finnal say on
  whether Trump can raise the US’s effective tariff rate to its highest in
  around a century. If the US government loses the case, some of the trade deals
  struck in recent months could also come unstuck. Good morning, and welcome to
  our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.
  There are signs that calm may be returning to the global bond market, after
  Tuesday’s sell-off drove government borrowing costs to multi-year highs.
  Earlier today, an auction of 30-year Japanese government bonds proceeded
  smoothly, helping to support Japan’s debt prices. Encouragingly for Tokyo,
  demand for its long-term debt held up pretty well – the bid-to-cover ratio,
  which measures the amount of bids against the amount of debt on offer, was
  3.31, only slightly below the 12-month average of 3.38. This has helped to
  push down the yields, or interest rates, on Japan’s debt in the bond market –
  a relief, after long-term yields hit record highs earlier this week. Hirofumi
  Suzuki, a strategist at SMBC, explained: Given the sharp selloff in the
  30-year yesterday, short-covering had been underway from the morning session,
  and the auction ended up passing smoothly. “That said, political uncertainty
  in Japan also continues, so upward pressure on Japanese yields is likely to
  persist.” Long-term bonds are under pressure due to concerns about the size of
  government debt, political obstacles to spending cuts, and structurally higher
  inflation. Yesterday, the yields on UK and US long-term debt both fell back,
  bringing some relief after Britain’s 30-year borrowing costs hit the highest
  level since 1998. Bond prices recovered after disappointing US job openings
  data was released, prompting investors to predict faster interest rate cuts.
  It showed that for the first time in more than four years, there are fewer
  open jobs in America than there are job seekers. Jim Reid, market strategist
  at Deutsche Bank, explains: The global bond selloff finally paused for breath
  yesterday, as weak US data meant investors ramped up their expectations for
  Fed rate cuts this year. The main catalyst was the JOLTS report for July,
  which showed that job openings fell to a 10-month low and exacerbated fears
  about a labour market slowdown. The number of job openings fell to an
  estimated 7.18m at the end of July, down from 7.36m the month before.
  Investors will be watching the latest employment data from the US, due later
  today, for further signs that its labour market is cooling. The agenda 9am
