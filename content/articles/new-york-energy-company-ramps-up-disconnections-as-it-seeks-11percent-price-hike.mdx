  An energy company seeking to hike utility bills in New York City by 11%
  disconnected more than 88,000 households during the first six months of 2025,
  signaling a crackdown on families struggling to cover rising energy costs even
  as the climate crisis drives extreme temperatures. Con Edison, the monopoly
  utility that provides electricity to 3.6m homes across the country’s largest
  city and neighboring Westchester county, disconnected almost 2.5% of all its
  customers between January and June this year – triple the total number of
  families left without power in 2024. One in five disconnected homes remain
  without power for at least a week. The utility shut off 16,327 households in
  the month leading up to 25 June. New York was hit by its first heatwave
  between 23 and 25 June, breaking daytime and night-time records in Central
  Park and driving a surge in emergency room visits. New York is among the most
  expensive places for electricity, with families shouldering above-inflation
  price hikes in recent years on top of unaffordable housing and the broader
  cost of living crisis stemming from the Covid pandemic. Heat-related deaths
  account for about 3% of all fatalities from May through September, making New
  York the second deadliest city for heat after Phoenix, Arizona. In the past
  five years, more than 40% of New Yorkers have fallen into arrears, and 23% of
  households were disconnected at least once – leaving families without access
  to a fridge, internet, cooking facilities and heat or cooling until they can
  find the money to pay for reconnection. Black and Latino New Yorkers are more
  than twice as likely as white residents to fall behind, and almost eight times
  more likely to have a utility shutoff, according to the 2024 Poverty
  Tracker/Robin Hood report on energy insecurity. “Disconnection is an effective
  cost recovery strategy but it’s also completely inhumane. It’s traumatizing
  for families and costs some people their lives,” said Diana Hernandez,
  co-author of the report and associate professor of sociomedical sciences at
  Columbia University. “People want to pay their bills but they are unaffordable
  for too many families.” Almost 16% of New York homes – one in six Con Edison
  residential customers – were behind on their energy bills at the end of 2024,
  with debts totaling $948m, according to data submitted by the utility to the
  state regulator. But as Con Edison ramped up disconnections over the past six
  months, the debt fell to $840m by the end of June with 12.5% of New Yorkers
  now behind on their bills. At the current rate, Con Edison could disconnect
  150,000 households by the end of the year, the highest number by any utility
  in the country, according to Mark Wolfe, an energy economist. “Energy is
  unaffordable so people fall behind. The disconnection numbers show that Con
  Edison is aggressively cracking down, and life is going to become harder for
  poor people in New York,” said Wolfe, executive director of the National
  Energy Assistance Directors Association (Neada). Researchers at Neada, the
  organization for state directors of the federally funded Low Income Home
  Energy Assistance Program (Liheap), collated the debt and disconnection
  figures submitted to the New York Public Services Commission, the regulator.
  There is no demographic breakdown but people of color, households with
  children, renters in small buildings, and people with pre-existing medical
  conditions who rely on electronic devices such as oxygen dispensers, as well
  as Bronx residents are all more likely to experience energy poverty and
  therefore a disconnection, the 2024 Robin Hood report found. A Con Edison
  spokesperson said: “Termination of service is a last resort, and we do so only
  after extensive outreach and exhausting all other options … nearly two-thirds
  of residential customers in arrears are on payment plans. It is essential that
  our customers pay their bills to maintain safe service and the most reliable
  system in the nation.” Most customers were reconnected within 24 hours and 80%
  within a week, the spokesperson added. Nationwide, an estimated one in three
  households experience energy poverty – the inability to access sufficient
  amounts of electricity and other energy sources due to financial hardship.
  Low-income households, people of color and states with the fewest social
  safety nets are disproportionately affected, and millions of families are
  regularly forced to ration food, medicines, energy and other essentials Across
  New York state – and the country – a patchwork of regulations prevent some
  households from being shut off on very hot or cold days, but millions are not
  protected at all. New York, like much of the US, is susceptible to extreme
  highs and low temperatures, and the climate crisis is driving more frequent
  and more intense heatwaves. The number of heat deaths has been rising over the
  past decade, and on average 525 people in New York City die prematurely each
  year for heat-related reasons – the vast majority due to the impact high
  temperatures and humidity have on existing medical conditions, according to
  the latest figures from the city’s department of public health. Heat kills
  Black New Yorkers at twice the rate of white residents due to past and current
  structural racism that creates economic, healthcare, housing, energy and other
  systems that benefit white people and disadvantage people of color, the report
  found. Most deaths occur in homes without access to functioning air
  conditioning. Citywide, 11% of New Yorkers do not have air conditioners at
  home but the rate is much higher in low-income communities of color. One study
  found that a fifth of renters do not use their air conditioner due to cost.
  And while protections have improved in recent years, it has not been enough to
  shield families hit hardest by rising energy prices, rents and inflation – or
  the increasingly brutal heat and humidity. According to its website, Con
  Edison currently suspends disconnections on the hottest and coldest days based
  on forecasts from the National Weather Service. In the summer, the utility
  will not disconnect a family the day of or day before the heat index – what
  the temperature feels like when humidity is taken into account – is forecast
  to hit 90F (32.2C) at Central Park – one of the shadiest parts of the city. It
  also suspends disconnections for two days after a 90F heat index day. Yet
  temperatures in some neighborhoods in the Bronx and upper Manhattan, where
  there are fewer trees, less access to air conditioning, more Black and Latino
  residents, and most heat deaths, exceed Central Park by 6 to 8 degrees due to
  the heat island effect, according to one study from 2022. Energy poverty is a
  chronic problem for many New Yorkers. New York state is the largest recipient
  of Liheap, the chronically underfunded bipartisan federal program that helped
  about 6m households keep on top of energy bills last year – and which narrowly
  survived being cut completely from Trump’s 2026 budget. In fiscal year
  2024-25, New York received $379m (almost 10%) of the total Liheap fund, and
  Governor Kathy Hochul invested an additional $35m to supplement support for
  heating bills in January after Liheap money ran out with months of winter
  still to go. In the summer, the Liheap program only covers the cost of an air
  conditioning unit and installation for qualifying low-income households in New
  York – not energy bills. A city program can provide a means-tested loan for
  working families in arrears. Disconnections declined during the pandemic
  thanks to a statewide moratorium and debt forgiveness schemes, as well as
  child tax credits and a boost to food stamps among other federal programs that
  helped lift millions of Americans out of poverty. But the Covid-era social
  safety programs have now all been terminated, and recent focus groups
  conducted by Hernandez and her colleagues found people still struggling to
  recover and rationing energy use because they were so concerned about rising
  bills. “The city has got better at advocating for households
  disproportionately impacted by disconnections but it’s a drop in the bucket of
  where it should be,” said Hernandez, the energy justice expert. “The 88,000
  households disconnected are people who have done everything to get the money
  and still couldn’t get caught up. It illustrates families have been left
  completely exposed.” Yet energy costs are about to get even higher in New
  York. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will make electricity production more
  expensive, leading to residents paying $140 a year on average more by 2030,
  according to analysis by Energy Innovation. The bill also slashes benefits
  such as Snap (food stamps) and Medicaid, which will put further pressure on
  millions of families. Meanwhile, Con Edison is under fire from city and state
  politicians including Hochul and the city comptroller (chief finance officer)
  and former mayoral candidate, Brad Lander, for requesting a rate hike of 11%
  for electricity and 13% for gas, which the regulator is currently considering.
  Con Ed’s proposed electricity rate hike could raise the average household bill
  by $372 next year. (The utility provides gas to 1.1m homes.) “The combination
  of rising temperatures, rising electricity rates, the possible termination of
  the federal Liheap program, and this increase in shutoffs by Con Ed risks
  dramatically increasing heat-related illness and deaths for New Yorkers,”
  Lander told the Guardian. “There needs to be strategies in place so that
  people will pay their bills – but to punish people who are poor by cutting off
  their electricity ever, but especially in extreme heat or wintertime, is
  inhumane. It is a form of debtors’ prison.” Con Edison said it provided $311m
  in bill discounts to income-eligible customers last year, and the regulator
  (PSC) recently expanded the Energy Affordability Program to help more
  vulnerable residents.
