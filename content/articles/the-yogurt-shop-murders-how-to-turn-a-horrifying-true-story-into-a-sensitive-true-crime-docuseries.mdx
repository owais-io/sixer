  Four teenage girls were viciously murdered in 1991, their bodies left to burn
  in a fire – along with so much evidence – that engulfed the Austin, Texas,
  yogurt shop where two of them worked. The memories surrounding this case can
  be fraught and vivid for anyone who lived in the area at the time, not just
  because of the devastating nature of the crime, but also the seismic way the
  surrounding community rallied around the victims’ families. They would march
  and hold up signs, put up billboards, and make buttons and coffee mugs, the
  paraphernalia all asking the question left unanswered to this day: “Who killed
  these girls?” This being Austin, local artists even came up with a song: We
  Will Not Forget. “Americans, the way we deal with grief,” observes Barbara
  Ayres-Wilson, the mother to two of the victims, “we had to make a marketing
  opportunity out of everything.” Ayres-Wilson makes those comments in old
  footage appearing in The Yogurt Shop Murders, somehow seeing the big picture
  irony from a distance, while still in the throes of her anguish. Margaret
  Brown’s four-part docuseries largely follows her lead. The Yogurt Shop Murders
  is as intensive and emotionally gutting as the true crime genre gets,
  especially as it leads with the trauma suffered by the victims, their families
  and others orbiting too close to the tragedy. But the series also regularly
  steps back, observing the cultural ironies and phenomena wrapped up in this
  case, and taking a measure of its broader implications, not just when it comes
  to the flaws in a justice system that can coerce false confessions – creating
  a whole other subset of victims – but also the very nature of true crime
  storytelling that The Yogurt Shop Murders participates in. Brown essentially
  made a layered and complex true crime masterpiece, largely by approaching the
  subject with so much resistance to what that genre typically entails – for
  instance, the voyeurism and near predatory fixation on the upsetting details.
  “I wasn’t really interested in this because of the true crime-iness of it,”
  says Brown on a Zoom call with the Guardian, thinking back on her initial
  response to the project when it was brought to her by executive producers Dave
  McCary and his Oscar-winning wife, Emma Stone. Brown, the empathetic
  film-maker who took a “community first” approach to her celebrated documentary
  about the slave ship Clotilda, Descendant, says she was nevertheless drawn to
  this story because it literally hits close to home. “It’s part of the fabric
  of this city,” says the Austin-based film-maker (originally from Mobile,
  Alabama, where Descendant takes place). The victims – 17-year-olds Eliza
  Thomas and Jennifer Harbison; the latter’s 15-year-old sister, Sarah, and her
  13-year-old friend Amy Ayers – were just a few years younger than Brown at the
  time of their murder. She has friends who went to school with the girls, knew
  them, or was on the cheerleading team with them. The tragedy looms large in
  her circles. She also saw a way into the story when observing the archival
  footage and observed what she describes as a David Lynch vibe. “It was like
  the same hair from Twin Peaks,” Brown explains. “You could see a version of
  what the film could be immediately from the counterculture in Austin back
  then, when [Richard Linklater’s] Slacker came out … I was like: ‘Oh, I could
  make a David Lynch movie that’s a documentary.’” Lynch has always been
  obsessed with the darkness lurking beneath pleasant surfaces, and the dividing
  lines within a locale (whether it’s Blue Velvet’s Lumberton, North Carolina,
  or Mulholland Drive, flanked by Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley). In his
  films, people living in alternate worlds violently collide. So Lynchian makes
  a fitting adjective for this case, considering how horror erupts in a frozen
  yogurt parlor, ripping through the innocence in what was a popular hangout
  spot for teens; or the way outsiders, specifically goth types and those who
  would hang out in Austin’s hidden crevices, were rounded up as suspects,
  exposing the social and class divisions permeating throughout the city; and
  the general cultural milieu of early-90s Austin, where, as Brown says, the
  “country guys and the counterculture people” co-exist. “Austin has always been
  this place where there’s a college town, but it’s also like a cowboy place,”
  says Brown, lumping both sides together as the Willie Nelson audience. “They
  all go see Willie.” But Brown’s approach to the material quickly shifted after
  the first interview with the victims’ families left her feeling gutted. “I
  felt it so deeply, their pain,” she says. “Sean [Amy Ayers’s older brother]
  was so worried about his memory of his sister fading. I remember that made
  such an impact. It was so heartbreaking the way he talked about how he
  couldn’t feel her anymore because these images were leaving his mind; her
  voice and everything. You just feel this family. I just was like: ‘OK, well, I
  cannot fuck this up.’ “I knew I couldn’t just make this stylized, slick thing
  … I got more interested in how people deal with loss. That’s the universal
  thing that everyone can relate to. Also, the story was so dark. I think to
  really live in the darkness of it, I needed some kind of redemption to just
  get me through.” Throughout the conversations in The Yogurt Shop Murders, a
  complex and fascinating thread around storytelling emerges, exploring both the
  healing and harmful functions of constructing a narrative when coping with
  such trauma. It begins with Ayres-Wilson, who on the night of the murders,
  doesn’t fully process the weight of her emotions until she has to tell loved
  ones what happened. Over the years, the victims’ families continue speaking to
  the media and the community as a way to hold on to the girls’ memories, while
  also pursuing justice. Eliza Thomas’s younger sister Sonora – who, as Brown
  explains, went through life feeling isolated because people can be wary about
  approaching her with the tragedy always looming – even offers an unexpected
  validation for the very true crime genre the film-maker was resisting. “This
  strange genre of crimes shows doesn’t just provide fodder for the curious,”
  Thomas tells Brown on camera. “It also provides an outlet for victims to tell
  a story that no one else wants to hear.” Brown proposes another rationale for
  true crime, pointing out that the genre’s audience is largely woman, some
  perhaps processing their own fears. “For some people,” she says, “it’s like:
  ‘Can I figure it out?’ But I think, for women, there’s something more primal
  about it. “You see in the series, there’s all these other ways [storytelling
  is] exploitative too. I was curious about the wholeness of that. It’s not just
  one thing.” As yet another dimension to the storytelling around the case,
  Brown mentions the detectives who were diagnosed with PTSD after fruitlessly
  attempting to construct the narrative surrounding the crime scene for years;
  and Claire Huie, a once aspiring film-maker who made a pass at building a
  documentary around this story over a decade ago, the severity of it making her
  walk away from both the film and her career aspirations. So much of Huie’s
  abandoned footage appears in The Yogurt Shop Murders, including interviews
  with the families, the detectives and Robert Springsteen, one of the men who
  sat on death row for the crime. Springsteen, who did not take part in Brown’s
  series, was convicted based on a confession that did not hold up on appeal.
  When it comes to this case, aggressive interrogator tactics led to multiple
  false confessions. In The Yogurt Shop Murders, Brown and her editor, Michael
  Bloch, go full surrealist Lynch when revisiting intense and nightmarish
  interrogation scenes, where officers constructed narratives for suspects to
  fill in the gaps. In a series where we see victim families use storytelling to
  hold onto their memories, these scenes – exposing memory’s elusive, fragile
  and misleading nature – stand apart in chilling and unsettling contrast. “You
  can’t make a show like this and not think about how your own memories about
  things are shifting,” says Brown. “I can have a memory and think: ‘Well, is
  that real? Did that really happen? Do I want that to be real?’ “I always am
  interested in complexity, how something can be positive in one way, and,
  another way, it can have a dark edge. Memory is a perfect example. It can be
  used as a trap and also a salve.” The Yogurt Shop Murders starts on 3 August
  on HBO and will be available to stream on Max with a UK date to be announced
