  Simon Jenkins says the teaching of oracy “was launched about 10 years ago by
  progressive educationists” (Another way we are failing an entire generation:
  we must teach young people to speak, 24 July). There has been enthusiasm for
  spoken English in schools for much longer than that. In 1989, the government
  published the report English for Ages 5 to 16. In it, Brian Cox argued for the
  greater inclusion of oracy by asserting that “talk is now widely recognised as
  promoting and embodying a range of skills and competence – both transactional
  and social – that are central to children’s overall language development”.
  Much effort had already gone into legitimising spoken English opportunities in
  the classroom, including by its appearance in examinations for CSE English.
  This was not only for formal oral presentations (debates, rehearsed readings
  etc) but more for the dynamic use of language arising from the multiplicity of
  environments with effective communication at their heart. Jenkins is right
  when he argues that the narrow focus on the three Rs is archaic and irrelevant
  to the real world. What we need is a learning environment in which children
  can experience and explore talk in all its forms, as the backbone of language
  and its development. Dr Mike Davis Blackpool, Lancashire • As a teacher of
  mathematics and computer science, I cannot let Simon Jenkins’ assertion that
  maths “is not needed by 95% of jobseekers” pass without comment. I accept that
  a lot of the maths taught for GCSE (eg trigonometry, quadratic functions, laws
  of indices) is irrelevant in daily life, but I imagine the same is true of all
  subjects, since most of us do not need, for example, to recall shapes of
  molecules or understand chromatography (science), or be familiar with medieval
  or early modern Britain (history). In her delightful book Is Maths Real?,
  Eugenia Cheng likens the study of maths to exercising core muscles. “There is
  no activity in life that involves only core muscles, but it’s helpful to have
  a strong core because it enables us to use the rest of our muscles to greater
  effect,” she writes. “It gives us better access to the rest of our strength,
  as well as protecting us against things like balance issues, tripping over and
  hurting our back.” All study for GCSE qualifications strengthens our brains –
  different subjects in slightly different ways. Hence studying a variety of
  subjects, including maths, is vital. Moreover, if we strip several of these
  subjects down to the core useful bits, what will be left for students to talk
  about in oracy practice sessions? Chris Willis Oxford • I couldn’t agree more
  with Simon Jenkins. When I was a child my parents had no money for books and,
  as I had a twin, an ideal playmate, the idea of sitting and quietly reading
  was a non-starter. My parents talked a lot. To each other and to us. Opinions,
  family jokes, quickfire wit, stories and a lot of questions and most
  important, how to listen as well as talk. All this was, of course, informal.
  My English teacher assumed I read all of the time at home, such was my ability
  to communicate. Sadly, with so many distractions in the home these days, the
  teaching of oracy in the curriculum seems more essential than ever for a
  child’s development and ability to communicate and to take their place in the
  increasingly complex world. Debbie Cameron Formby, Merseyside • Have an
