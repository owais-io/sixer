  A man commandeered a transportation cart at New York’s Buffalo Niagara
  international airport and destroyed moving walkways with it at the facility,
  according to authorities investigating the unusual incident. Kevin J Sinning,
  29, of Wyoming, faces charges of second-degree criminal mischief, disorderly
  conduct, criminal nuisance, third-degree grand larceny and criminal possession
  of stolen property worth more than $3,000 after his arrest at about 1am on 28
  July, the Niagara frontier transportation authority police department said.
  The police department said that Sinning was “visibly intoxicated” at the time
  of his arrest, NBC News reported. In video footage circulated on social media,
  Sinning was evidently recorded slowly driving the cart up and down the
  hallways of the airport. One clip showed damage to metal beams on one of the
  airport’s moving walkways. A different clip showed the cart being driven down
  another moving walkway that was too small for the vehicle. The vehicle crushed
  metal and shattered glass along the walkway. A TikTok video of the joyride
  attributed to Sinning generated more than 9m views as well as more than
  450,000 likes. Sinning declined to comment on Friday, according to NBC. • The
  subheading of this article was amended on 3 August 2025 to correct a
  misrendering of the surname of Kevin Sinning.
