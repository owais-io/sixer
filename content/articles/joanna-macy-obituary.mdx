  The American environmentalist writer and teacher Joanna Macy, who has died
  aged 96, pioneered workshops that helped people deal with anxiety over the
  future of the planet, and develop a fresh way of experiencing the world. Her
  teaching and 12 books drew on Buddhism, systems thinking – which looks at the
  world as an interconnected whole rather than separate parts – and deep ecology
  – the understanding that humans are simply one part of our living planet.
  Macy’s most distinctive gift, however, was her ability to translate a
  theoretical understanding of the world and its challenges into what the
  Buddhist teacher David Loy called an “embodied understanding” – something
  people could feel and experience directly. She first developed “despair and
  empowerment” workshops during the 1970s, as a response to collective anxiety
  over the cold war and nuclear arms race, which led many to feel the world was
  on the brink of destruction. As these anxieties shifted to the climate crisis
  in recent decades, her work offered a way to transform people’s despair into
  positive action, exerting a profound influence on the peace and environmental
  movements. Her best known programme, The Work That Reconnects, takes
  participants through a “spiral” process comprising four stages. The first
  stage is “gratitude”, appreciating that the world is a gift. The next stage
  involves recognising the pain we feel in response to the state of the world
  and allowing it to surface as despair. “The refusal to feel takes a heavy
  toll,” Macy wrote in her 1991 essay collection World As Lover, World As Self.
  “The energy expended in pushing down despair is diverted from more creative
  uses, depleting the resilience and imagination needed for fresh visions and
  strategies.” Key to the process is recognising that despair can forge a
  compassionate connection with others, and in the third stage, “seeing with new
  eyes”, participants are encouraged to explore a radical different experience
  of the world. The final stage is “going forth” to make a difference, or
  commitment to participating in what Macy called The Great Turning, that is,
  the transition to a “life-sustaining society”. Macy believed that the roots of
  the environmental crisis were spiritual and psychological, growing from a
  faulty view of the world that is embedded in what she called the “industrial
  growth society”. An alternative, life-sustaining society could only grow from
  an intensely imagined alternative understanding of life as an interconnected
  web. Born Mary Joanne Rogers in Los Angeles, she grew up in New York, the
  youngest of three children born to Margaret (nee Kinsey), a church
  administrator, and Hartley, a stockbroker. After graduating from Wellesley
  College in biblical history in 1950, she briefly worked for the CIA in West
  Germany, leaving in 1953 to marry Fran Macy, a Peace Corps officer and later a
  prominent anti-nuclear campaigner. She travelled with him to Nigeria, Tunisia,
  and India, where her encounters with Tibetan refugees sparked a lifelong
  engagement with Buddhism. In her 2000 memoir, Widening Circles, Macy wrote of
  this first encounter with Buddhists in the 60s: “The company of these Tibetans
  filled me with a kind of wild gladness. I felt increasingly drawn to the
  religion – or whatever it was – that had shaped their minds.” The family
  returned to the US in 1969, where Macy continued to study Buddhism, mainly
  with Theravada Buddhist teachers. In 1978 she gained a PhD from Syracuse
  University with a thesis in “mutual causality in Buddhism and general systems
  theory”. She argued that both disciplines implied seeing the world as an
  interconnected system of which we ourselves are a part. The motivation behind
  her PhD, she later commented, was “religious and philosophical concerns made
  urgent by the world situation”. Fran’s involvement in the nuclear disarmament
  campaign had drawn Joanna into the movement. The mixture of despair and
  compassion she felt led her to reflect on how the two emotions were connected
  and, in collaboration with the psychologist Chellis Glendinning and the
  activist Fran Peavey, Macy developed her first workshops. While many others in
  the environmental movement focused on political and scientific issues, Macy
  and other proponents of deep ecology promoted the spiritual transformation
  they believed must accompany social change. Participants in The Work That
  Reconnects, for instance, might be invited to identify with their ancestors in
  the distant past, a descendant seven generations in the future, or with a
  being of another species. She introduced a strong environmental emphasis to
  the global Engaged Buddhism movement, and the Buddhist-based Naropa University
  in Colorado recently established the Joanna Macy Center for Resilience and
  Regeneration to continue her work. A committed teacher, Macy continued to
  offer workshops online well into her 90s. Fran died in 2009. She is survived
  by her three children, Christopher, Jack and Peggy, and three grandchildren,
  Julien, Eliza and Lydia. • Joanna (Mary Joanne) Macy, writer, teacher and
  environmental activist, born 2 May 1929; died 19 July 2025
