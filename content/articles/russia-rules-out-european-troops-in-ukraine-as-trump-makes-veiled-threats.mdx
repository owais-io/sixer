  Moscow threw Donald Trump’s Ukraine peace initiative into disarray on
  Thursday, insisting it must have a veto over any postwar support for the
  country as its forces carried out a large-scale overnight missile barrage. In
  a series of hardline remarks, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said
  European proposals to deploy troops in Ukraine after a settlement would amount
  to “foreign intervention”, which he called absolutely unacceptable for Russia.
  Lavrov said Russia wanted to return to discussing a framework first proposed
  during the initial peace talks held in Istanbul in 2022, under which Moscow
  and Beijing would help guarantee Ukraine’s security alongside European allies
  – terms Kyiv considers unacceptable. “We support the principles and security
  guarantees that were agreed … in April 2022,” Lavrov said. “Anything else … is
  of course an absolutely futile undertaking.” European leaders are exploring
  possible security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, building on Trump’s
  promise to back the country under any settlement with Russia. France, Britain
  and Estonia have indicated they could send troops to a postwar Ukraine, while
  several other nations said they might take part, though much depends on US
  involvement. Lavrov’s comments cast doubt on the prospects for peace talks. On
  Thursday night, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy decried an aerial
  assault that included a major US electronics manufacturer among the targets,
  noting its significance amid US-brokered efforts to end the war. In a post on
  X, Zelenskyy wrote that “the Russians practically burned down an American
  company producing electronics – home appliances, nothing military. “The
  Russians knew exactly where they lobbed the missiles. We believe this was a
  deliberate attack against American property and investments in Ukraine,” he
  said, adding: “Telling attack, right as the world awaits a clear answer from
  Russia on negotiations to end the war. “This war must be brought to an end.
  Pressure must be exerted on Russia to end the war. Putin understands nothing
  but force and pressure,” Zelenskyy said. The Ukrainian military said Moscow
  had fired 574 drones and 40 missiles on Thursday that struck western regions,
  killing at least one person and injuring 15. Andy Hunder, president of the
  American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine., said that 600 night shift workers
  were on the premises at the time of the strike on the US factory, and six were
  injured. “The message is clear: Russia is not looking for peace. Russia is
  attacking American business in Ukraine, humiliating American business.”
  Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes targeted “enterprises of the
  Ukrainian military-industrial complex,” including drone factories, storage
  depots, missile launch sites and areas where Ukrainian troops were gathered.
  Russia has repeatedly denied targeting civilian areas of Ukraine. In the
  western city of Lviv, one person was killed and three were injured as the
  attack damaged 26 residential buildings, a kindergarten and administrative
  buildings, regional head Maksym Kozytskyi wrote on Telegram. The regional
  prosecutor’s office said three Russian cruise missiles with cluster munitions
  struck the city. Ukraine, for its part, has stepped up drone attacks on
  Russian infrastructure supporting the war, with strikes on oil refineries
  pushing wholesale gasoline prices in Russia to record highs. After the recent
  Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, US officials said the Russian president had
  accepted the prospect of western security guarantees for Ukraine. But the
  latest statements suggest Moscow may be backing away from that understanding –
  or that Washington may have misinterpreted the Kremlin’s position from the
  outset. Trump on Thursday appeared to vent his frustration at Russia’s
  obstruction. In a post on Truth Social, the US president blamed his
  predecessor, Joe Biden, for not allowing Ukraine to “fight back” against
  Russia. “It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an
  invaders country. It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic
  defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning! It
  is like that with Ukraine and Russia. Crooked and grossly incompetent Joe
  Biden would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND. How did that work out? …
  Interesting times ahead!!!” Trump wrote. Trump’s veiled threats against Russia
  will be welcomed in Kyiv and European capitals, though the US leader has
  previously backed away from imposing sanctions or boosting support for
  Ukraine. Lavrov also poured cold water on the prospect of a summit between the
  Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy, which has been touted by Trump. Lavrov said a bilateral meeting at
  the highest level would be possible only “if all issues requiring discussion
  are thoroughly prepared”. He suggested that Putin would meet Zelenskyy only to
  accept Russia’s maximalist conditions, which would entail Ukraine’s
  capitulation. Russia’s veteran foreign minister further questioned whether
  Zelenskyy had the legitimacy to sign any future peace accord, parroting a
  familiar Kremlin line that portrays Ukraine’s leadership as illegitimate.
  Despite a flurry of diplomacy in recent days between Trump and his Russian and
  Ukrainian counterparts, the path to peace remains uncertain as Moscow has
  shown little willingness to climb down from its maximalist demands. Even so,
  the White House on Wednesday continued to strike a positive tone. “President
  Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and
  Ukrainian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end
  the war,” a White House spokesperson told Fox News. Speaking to foreign
  correspondents in Kyiv, Zelenskyy, who has agreed to meet Putin, said he would
  like a “strong reaction” from Washington if the Russian leader was not willing
  to sit down for a bilateral meeting with him soon. “I responded immediately to
  the proposal for a bilateral meeting: we are ready. But what if the Russians
  are not ready?” Zelenskyy said in comments released on Thursday from a
  briefing with reporters in Kyiv a day earlier. As uncertainty over peace talks
  persisted, Russia launched one of its heaviest bombardments in weeks.
