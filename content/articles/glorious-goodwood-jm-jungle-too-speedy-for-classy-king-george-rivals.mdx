  Three of the dozen runners in the Group Two King George Stakes at Goodwood on
  Friday had a Group One success to their name and all but one had at least run
  in a Group-class contest, but there is often only a small gap for the best
  sprint handicappers to bridge when they step into Pattern company and Jm
  Jungle, the Group-race debutant, proved the point once again with a 14-1
  victory in the afternoon’s feature event. The field was reduced to 11 at the
  start when Clarendon House planted himself in the stalls, but Jm Jungle, with
  winner of the “Dash” Handicap at Epsom on Derby day over the fastest
  five-furlong course in the country, was soon helping to set a strong pace. The
  Australian-trained mare, Asfoora, a Group One winner at Royal Ascot last
  summer, made a brief attempt to challenge against the far rail while She’s
  Quality finished fast down the middle, but Jm Jungle and Jason Hart had just
  enough left to hold on for a neck success. It was a second win in the race in
  the space of three years for the John and Sean Quinn stable, successful in
  2023 with the hugely popular Highfield Princess. “It was easier watching
  Highfield Princess because she never looked like getting beat,” Sean Quinn
  said. “I was hoping, willing for the line to come in the last furlong today,
  but it did and he toughed it out. The second [She’s Quality] came to him and I
  think he went again. “He is so good on these downhill tracks, but then he’s
  good at York, he is just a good horse. Jason said after York [in May] that he
  would love to ride him in the [Group One] Nunthorpe [at the same track]
  because they will go lickety-split and that will suit him really well. He is a
  Group Two winner now and we don’t have far to go, 20-odd miles [to York], so
  that is something to look forward to.” Jm Jungle is top-priced at 16-1 for the
  Nunthorpe on the third day of York’s Ebor meeting later this month. In
  Ireland, meanwhile, the news on Friday morning that Thurles racecourse will
  close with immediate effect was met with sadness and surprise by fans and
  professionals alike. Tony McCoy, the 20-times British champion over jumps, and
  Rachael Blackmore, the first female rider to win the Grand National, both rode
  their first winners at the County Tipperary track, while leading
  steeplechasers including Allaho, Sizing John and Amberleigh House landed the
  track’s Grade Two Kinloch Brae Chase. “It was a major shock this morning to
  hear the news,” Willie Mullins, the reigning champion trainer over jumps in
  both Britain and Ireland, said on Friday. “It will be a huge blow for Irish
  racing, more specifically Irish jump racing and winter jump racing.“Thurles is
  a track that always had beautiful ground in the winter when other tracks
  couldn’t.” Thurles had been scheduled to stage 11 fixtures during the 2024/25
  season. “I think we’ll be doing our best to see if there’s any way we can save
  the track for racing in Ireland,” Mullins said. “It will need a lot of local
  support. However, on the bigger scale, Irish winter jump racing needs it too,
  I think.” Get It can sprint home in Stewards’ Cup A remarkable 37mm of rain
  arrived at Goodwood on Thursday and the going was officially heavy by
  mid-afternoon, but the clerk of the course has since suggested that it was
  probably no worse than soft and breezy weather ahead of Saturday’s Stewards’
  Cup should accelerate the drying-out process. If so, it can only be good news
  for George Baker’s Get It (3.05) in his attempt to repeat last year’s
  front-running success in Glorious Goodwood’s historic sprint handicap. There
  was a sense that Get It had a fair slice of luck on his side after last year’s
  victory, not least as he had a perfect draw against the stands’ rail, but
  there was no fluke about his similar all-the-way success in the Wokingham
  Handicap at Royal Ascot at June, at a track that does not favour front-running
  tactics to anything like the same extent. That was a new career-best for
  George Baker’s seven-year-old and he has ended up just one stall further away
  from the rail this time around, while a drop in Get It’s rating during
  lacklustre spell in Bahrain earlier this year means that he is just 6lb higher
  in the weights despite two wins already this season. Pat Cosgrave’s rivals
  will be forewarned of his plan this year but that does not necessarily mean
  that it will be any easier to counter, and Get It is a tempting 10-1 chance to
  become the second dual winner of the Stewards’ Cup in the space of three
  years. Goodwood 1.20 Al Aasy appeared to back out of a struggle more than once
  in the early years of his career but an overall strike-rate of 40% – 10 wins
  from 25 starts – is hard to knock and he was a cosy winner of this contest 12
  months ago. Goodwood 1.55 The stoutly-bred French Duke was never a factor
  after a slow start in the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes at Royal Ascot last time,
  Roger Varian’s gelding had progressed by the race to that point and could well
  improve further for this step up in trip. Newmarket 2.10 An opening mark of 77
  looks more than fair for Awaafi, who lost little in defeat under a penalty at
  Haydock last time and should appreciate the stiffer finish here. Goodwood 2.30
  The lightly raced Waardah improved significantly for the step up from a mile
  to 10 furlongs at this track last time out and she is bred to progress further
  for an additional half-mile as she tackles Group company for the first time.
  Newmarket 3.20 This drop in grade could see a return to winning form for Sioux
  Life, a Group Two winner in Italy last year, after coming up short in Group
  company on her first two starts for Marco Botti. Goodwood 3.45 Mudbir has an
  ideal draw against the rail and had no issues with the drop from a mile to
  seven furlongs when successful on his handicap debut at Sandown in July. He is
  from one of the Shadwell operation’s best families and could well be better
  than a handicapper in time.
