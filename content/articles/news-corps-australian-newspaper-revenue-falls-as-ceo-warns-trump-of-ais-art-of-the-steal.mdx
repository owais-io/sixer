  of the steal’

  Revenue generated from News Corp’s global newspaper mastheads has fallen
  sharply, including in Australia, weighing down an otherwise positive financial
  result. Rupert Murdoch’s media conglomerate continues to generate large wads
  of cash from its digital real estate arm but advertising revenue at News Corp
  Australia, a division that includes the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and
  the Herald Sun, was down 5% over the past financial year to US$343m (A$530m).
  Circulation and subscription revenue also fell, according to results released
  early on Wednesday. Sign up to get Guardian Australia’s weekly media diary as
  a free newsletter Its UK news division, which counts the Times and the Sun
  among its mastheads, suffered even steeper revenue falls, as weak advertising
  conditions buffeted media companies around the world. News Corp, a
  US-headquartered company that is also listed on the ASX, owns mastheads in the
  US, the UK and Australia, and operates the book publisher HarperCollins. The
  Murdoch-controlled company also owns the Wall Street Journal publisher Dow
  Jones and has a majority stake in REA Group, the owner of realestate.com.au.
  It announced the sale of Foxtel late last year. While News Corp is best known
  for its traditional media assets, it describes the book publishing, real
  estate portal and Dow Jones information businesses as its “core growth
  pillars”. The latter two divisions generated record income last year, lifting
  overall revenue to US$8.45bn (A$13.1bn), up 2%. Its controlling stake in REA
  has generated an ongoing windfall for News Corp, given that the division is
  tapped directly into Australia’s robust property market. The real estate
  portal is expected to soon face stiffer competition from its rival Domain,
  which has just been sold to the US giant CoStar. The News Corp chief
  executive, Robert Thomson, described the overall result as “sterling”. Thomson
  told analysts shortly after the financials were released that News Corp was in
  “in the midst of advanced negotiations with several AI companies” over the
  purchase of its intellectual property. Media companies around the world have
  raised concerns over how they will be compensated for content already being
  used to train AI products. In comments designed to attract the attention of
  the US president, Thomson referred to books including Donald Trump’s The Art
  of the Deal being used by AI engines without compensation. “Is it right that
  his books should be consumed by an AI engine which then profits from his
  thoughts by cannibalising his concepts, thus undermining future sales of his
  book?” Thomson said. “Suddenly, The Art of the Deal has become the art of the
  steal. “We will fight to protect the intellectual property of our authors and
  journalists and continue to woo and to sue companies that violate the most
  basic property rights.”
