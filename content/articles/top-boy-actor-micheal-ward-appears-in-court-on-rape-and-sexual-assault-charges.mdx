  Micheal Ward, the Bafta-winning actor who starred in Top Boy and Blue Story,
  has appeared in court on charges of rape and sexual assault. Ward, 27, who is
  also known for roles in shows and films including Small Axe, The Old Guard and
  Empire of Light, appeared at Thames magistrates court on Thursday wearing dark
  glasses and a black jacket. He spoke to confirm his name, address and date of
  birth during a short hearing. The actor, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, did not
  enter any pleas and was granted conditional bail. He will appear at
  Snaresbrook crown court on 25 September. The charges relate to one woman and
  are alleged to have taken place in January 2023. In a statement issued after
  the charges were announced last month, Ward said: “I deny the charges against
  me entirely. I have cooperated fully with the police throughout their
  investigation and will continue to cooperate. “I recognise that proceedings
  are now ongoing, and I have full faith that they will lead to my name being
  cleared. Given those proceedings, I am unable to comment further.” Ward first
  came on to screens in the 2016 film Brotherhood but is best known for his role
  as Jamie in Top Boy from 2019 until 2022. He won the Bafta rising star award
  in 2020 and has been nominated a further two times. In 2021, he was nominated
  for the best supporting actor Bafta for his role as Franklyn Cooper in Lovers
  Rock, part of the BBC series Small Axe. In 2023, he was nominated for the best
  actor in a supporting role for his performance as Stephen Murray in the Sam
  Mendes-directed film Empire of Light. He also stars in Eddington alongside
  Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, which is currently in cinemas.
