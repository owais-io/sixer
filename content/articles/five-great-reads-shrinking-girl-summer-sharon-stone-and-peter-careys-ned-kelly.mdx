  Happy Saturday! I’m back selecting some of my favourite reads from the past
  seven days. Photographer Anne Geddes reflecting on the Cabbage Kids and the
  flowerpot babies that made her famous almost passed me by – see it as a little
  treat before we dig in. 1. ‘Is everyone getting smaller except me?’ The body
  positivity movement seems to be dead, and no one is trying to resuscitate it.
  If previous years had “Brat summer” and “hot girl summer”, Rose Stokes says we
  are now living through the northern hemisphere’s “shrinking girl summer”.
  Adele, Lizzo, Oprah Winfrey: You name it! Celebrities and, it seems, nearly
  everyone else have tried weight-loss drugs. Even Stokes did. Torment and
  temptation: But for overweight people who choose not to take the jabs, or for
  whom they don’t work, the “pervasive trend” is making life harder. How long
  will it take to read: Seven minutes. 2. Staying prepped You might remember a
  few newsletters ago I recommended a story on prepping going mainstream in the
  UK. Consider this your follow-up: on the Australians dedicating their lives to
  preparing for the end of civilisation. Survivalism: Kate Lyons interviews
  preppers, “country prepared” people and even a “bush survivalist” to better
  understand their methods and motives. Expert: Australians tend to be more
  “practical” preppers (in case of bushfires or other natural disasters, where
  supplies will eventually come) says Bradley Garrett, a geographer and
  researcher in preppers. While in America: Prepping is on the rise in the US
  amid a second Trump presidency. “They’re much more concerned that help is not
  going to arrive and you’re on your own,” he says. How long will it take to
  read: Five and a half minutes. 3. Sharon Stone on strength and survival Before
  Sharon Stone found out whether she had won an Oscar for her performance in
  Casino, Francis Ford Coppola told her she wouldn’t win. It was at a
  pre-ceremony party. When she asked why, the Hollywood director replied, “I
  didn’t win it for The Godfather and Marty didn’t win it for Raging Bull and
  you’re not going to win it for Casino,” she tells Simon Hattenstone. *** “So
  that is what I have carried through my life – that I am a big fat loser like
  Marty and Francis Ford Coppola.” – Sharon Stone Why Stone never got offered
  any big roles after that movie or nomination is something that has plagued the
  actor for the decades since. ‘Too good’: Her theory as to why is a must read.
  How long will it take to read: 10 minutes. 4. Twenty-five years on from True
  History of the Kelly Gang Peter Carey says his literary muse came to him when
  he was standing in front of a Sidney Nolan painting. He was a few years out of
  school, and there the figure was: Ned Kelly. Carey might not have known it
  then, but he would go on “to make modern poetry from the voice of a hero who
  was condemned to death” into a Booker-winning masterpiece. And in this read,
  he shares just how he did it. Readers’ reply: “It will, and should, give any
  aspiring author not only pause, but inspiration.” How long will it take to
  read: Four and a half minutes. 5. ‘Trump is a horror story, isn’t he?’:
  Stephen King Apparently Stephen King doesn’t like doing interviews very much.
  Perhaps he did this one because it was led by our wonderful readers. In it,
  King reveals his sources of inspiration, the colour of fear, knowing when to
  quit – and why manual labour is invaluable for writers. His take on Trump?
  Impeachment is the solution, but “it’s a horror story either way”. How long
  will it take to read: Four minutes. Further reading: “She’s the one that
  matters”: the growing influence of Melania on Donald Trump, by Patrick
  Wintour, is a final must-read. Sign up If you would like to receive these Five
