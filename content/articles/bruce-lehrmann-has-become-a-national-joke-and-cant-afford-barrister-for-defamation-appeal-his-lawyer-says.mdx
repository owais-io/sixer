  Bruce Lehrmann can’t afford a barrister to represent him in an appeal against
  his lost defamation case and deserves substantial damages because he is “a
  national joke”, the federal court has heard. Lehrmann is appealing Justice
  Michael Lee’s April 2024 judgment, which found the former Liberal staffer was
  not defamed by Lisa Wilkinson and Network 10 when The Project broadcast an
  interview with Brittany Higgins in 2021 in which she alleged she was raped in
  Parliament House. Opening the three-day appeal hearing, Lehrmann’s lawyer,
  Zali Burrows, apologised to the full bench of the federal court, justices
  Michael Wigney, Craig Colvin and Wendy Abraham, for her client’s failure to
  appoint an experienced barrister. Introducing her argument for substantial
  damages should the court uphold any of the grounds for appeal, Burrows said
  her client was vilified in traditional and social media. “He’s pretty much
  become the national joke … [and] Australia’s most hated man,” Burrows said.
  Burrows said Lehrmann “really wanted” Sydney barrister Guy Reynolds, SC, but
  “couldn’t afford” him so she would appear instead, and Lehrmann would sit
  beside her. “I hope you don’t mind Mr Lehrmann joining me at the bar table,”
  she said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Burrows is a criminal defence lawyer
  and not an experienced barrister, a fact she pointed out to the bench when she
  said she was up against top silks Matt Collins KC, for Ten, and Sue
  Chrysanthou SC, for Wilkinson. Justice Wigney assured Burrows she was well
  qualified, but did instruct her on some of the rules of the court as she
  presented her submissions. He reminded her she didn’t need to read out
  passages and should reference them instead. “Sorry, What? What? What is the
  relevance of this if you don’t mind me asking?” Wigney said in response to
  Burrows raising the Logies speech given by Wilkinson when she won an award for
  the interview with Higgins. When Burrows characterised Lee’s judgment as one
  which found a “non-violent rape” had occurred, Colvin said: “I’m not sure he
  found a non-violent rape, and I’m not sure that’s a concept I understand.”
  Burrows was repeatedly questioned by the justices about her four grounds of
  appeal. On the first of these grounds – that Lehrmann was denied procedural
  fairness and natural justice – Colvin said “I don’t understand the logic of
  this submission”. Lehrmann’s case is that he was denied procedural fairness
  because Lee’s findings about the alleged rape differed from the one alleged by
  Ten and Wilkinson. Burrows said Lehrmann was not given a chance to respond to
  that version of the rape. Collins, for Ten, told the court Lehrmann’s grounds
  of appeal are “misconceived” and “a distraction, in our respectful
  submission”. “Because, at the end of the day, this was a defamation case, not
  a rape case,” Collins said. “Sexual intercourse with someone without consent,
  in circumstances where you know they’re drunk, in our submission was satisfied
  as the ordinary definition of the way we say the ordinary person would
  interpret the word rape.” “Is it really plausible in 2021 that a person in Mr
  Lehrmann’s position did not at any time turn his mind to the question of
  consent, having regard to the way in which social mores towards sexual
  relations between the genders have evolved?” Burrows declined to detail all
  her grounds of appeal, saying she would prefer to address them in reply.
  Wigney warned her that this was unconventional and she could not introduce
  anything new in reply. Collins said it was an “astonishing submission” that
  Lehrmann’s evidence might have been different if he had been given the chance
  to respond to questions about a “non-violent rape”. “Well that’s, with
  respect, an astonishing submission, and it could only mean that had the
  pleading alleged a sexual assault in which consent was in question, he would
  have conceded to having had sexual intercourse with her, but argued that he
  thought he had her consent, or he did have her consent. That was never the way
  he ran his case,” he said. In submissions on the issue of qualified privilege
  Chrysanthou said Lee should not have criticised Wilkinson for believing
  Higgins when she first came to her and her producer Angus Llewellyn with her
  rape allegation. She said it was “ironic” Lee was critical of Wilkinson’s
  belief in Higgins when he found that her rape allegations had “a ring of
  truth”. “A judge of this court can watch a witness and say in a judgment to a
  very high standard, ‘I believe you’,” Chrysanthou said. “So what is wrong with
  a journalist — with my client’s experience in this issue — listening to Ms
  Higgins … and finding that she believed her as a starting point?” Lehrmann was
  charged with sexual intercourse without consent in 2021, and at his criminal
  trial in 2022 pleaded not guilty, denying that any sexual activity had
  occurred. After his criminal trial was aborted in December 2022, prosecutors
  dropped charges against Lehrmann for the alleged rape of Higgins, saying a
  retrial would pose an “unacceptable risk” to her health. Lehrmann has
  maintained his innocence. The hearing continues on Thursday at 10.15am.
