  Two more “misleading” adverts promoting heat pumps have been banned by the
  UK’s advertising watchdog. A week after the Advertising Standards Authority
  banned an Octopus Energy ad that claimed consumers could have a heat pump
  installed for as little as £500, it has taken action against adverts from the
  home heating supplier Aira and from EDF Energy. The ASA found that the two
  ads, which appeared online, omitted key information about the eligibility
  criteria for government funding available for installing the pumps. The
  government’s boiler upgrade scheme for England and Wales provides grants of
  £7,500 to householders who switch from gas boilers to heat pumps. A similar
  programme, the Home Energy Scotland grant and loan scheme, runs in Scotland.
  The UK government has a target of 600,000 heat pump installations annually by
  2028, but there have been claims that the current take-up is too low. The
  Resolution Foundation thinktank said in April that “the rollout of heat pumps
  is slow, with fewer than 100,000 fitted into British homes in 2024”. An ad on
  a Meta platform for Aira, seen in March, said: “Ditch your gas boiler for an
  Aira heat pump today … £7,500 grant available.” EDF’s Google advert in
  February said: “Get a £7,500 grant – EDF air source heat pumps.” The ads were
  identified for investigation by an ASA system that uses artificial
  intelligence to check ads in specific sectors. The watchdog said of both
  promotions that “the ad gave the impression consumers would be automatically
  eligible to receive a government grant of £7,500, and it did not make clear
  the government funding for a heat pump was subject to eligibility”. It added:
  “We considered that was material information that should have been included.
  Because the ad omitted material information, we concluded it was likely to
  mislead.” The ASA said there were a number of eligibility criteria that
  consumers needed to satisfy in order to qualify for funding for a heat pump,
  and that these differed between the two official schemes. Aira told the ASA
  that the ad was targeted only at homeowners in England and Scotland, where
  £7,500 grants were available. The company said it did not believe a consumer
  would interpret the ad as meaning that the grants were given automatically and
  without conditions. EDF told the watchdog that its ad linked through to one of
  three pages, where all relevant information about the government funding’s
  eligibility criteria was made clear. It argued that consumers would understand
  that by clicking on the ad they would land on a page that would explain what
  they needed to do to get a £7,500 grant. In response to the ban, Chris
  Collinson, Aira’s UK chief executive, said: “We are committed to providing
  complete transparency around the eligibility criteria and material information
  surrounding the availability of government grants for heat pumps in the UK,
  and to compliance with industry codes of conduct. Aira has taken immediate
  steps to address the points raised in ASA’s ruling.” EDF said that “neither
  the ASA [n]or ourselves received any complaints about the advert; however, we
  accept their ruling as we are fully aligned to their objective of improving
  the clarity of customer communications”. The spokesperson said it had already
  updated its marketing information, “and would have done so if requested, as we
  take a collaborative approach. We have encouraged the ASA to reach out
  informally should they have any concerns in the future.”
