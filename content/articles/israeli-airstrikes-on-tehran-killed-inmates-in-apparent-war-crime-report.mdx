  Israeli airstrikes on Tehran’s Evin prison in June killed scores of detainees,
  visitors and staff in what Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called an “apparent
  war crime”. Iranian authorities have since subjected survivors to abuse,
  enforced disappearances and inhumane detention conditions, the rights group
  said. HRW’s investigation, based on satellite imagery, videos and witness
  accounts, found the 23 June Israeli airstrikes destroyed visitation halls,
  prison wards, the central kitchen, the medical clinic and administrative
  offices. No evident military targets were identified in the facility, which
  held more than 1,500 prisoners at the time, many of whom had been jailed for
  peaceful activism. “Israel’s strikes on Evin prison on June 23 killed and
  injured scores of civilians without any evident military target in violation
  of the laws of war and is an apparent war crime,” said Michael Page, deputy
  Middle East director at HRW. “The Israeli attack placed at grave risk the
  already precarious lives of Evin’s prisoners, many of them wrongfully detained
  dissidents and activists.” At least 80 people died in the attack, which
  occurred during visiting hours, when public areas were at their busiest. HRW
  described the strike as unlawfully indiscriminate. Israeli officials have
  called Evin a “symbol of oppression” but have provided no evidence of military
  use. The prison attack took place during a 12-day conflict between Israel and
  Iran in which hundreds of civilians were killed on the Iranian side. The
  US-based rights group Human Rights Activists in Iran (HRAI) said the Israeli
  strikes on Iran resulted in at least 5,665 casualties, including 1,190 killed
  and 4,475 injured, both military and civilian. The Iranian security forces
  also arrested 1,596 individuals during the 12-day war, the group added.
  Twenty-eight people died on the Israeli side, all but one of them civilians.
  In the aftermath, HRW said, Iranian authorities moved prisoners to two main
  detention centres in Tehran province – Shahr-e Rey prison, or Qarchak, for
  women, and the Greater Tehran Central Penitentiary, or Fashafouyeh, for men –
  shackling male inmates in pairs, beating some with batons and using electric
  shocks (on return to Evin) for protesting their handcuffing and the transfer
  of death row prisoners. Women were locked in their ward without water or phone
  access before being moved on 24 June to Qarchak, notorious for overcrowding
  and inhumane conditions. “Iranian authorities have committed a catalogue of
  violations against prisoners in the aftermath of the attack, including
  beatings, insults, and threats during transfers, and holding prisoners in
  appalling conditions that have endangered their lives and health. Death-row
  inmates and those forcibly disappeared are now at heightened risk of torture
  or execution,” added Page. Some detainees were returned to Evin 46 days later
  only to face similar violence during transfers. Authorities have withheld
  information on the fate and whereabouts of some detainees held by security and
  intelligence agencies, including dissidents, human rights activists, and dual
  or foreign nationals. Among them is Swedish-Iranian physician Ahmadreza
  Djalali, on death row since 2017. Families have reported only brief, monitored
  calls from missing prisoners, with no information on their location or
  condition, a situation HRW says amounts to enforced disappearance. Transferred
  prisoners have faced overcrowded, insect-infested cells, with some forced to
  sleep on floors. “Iranian authorities should not use Israel’s strikes on Evin
  prison as another opportunity to subject prisoners, including those who should
  never have been in prison in the first place, to ill-treatment,” he said. HRW
  has called for independent investigations into violations by both Israel and
  Iran, with those responsible held accountable for possible war crimes. • This
  article was amended on 14 August 2025 to correct the death toll from the June
  conflict between Israel and Iran. A previous version erroneously gave the
  figure as “hundreds of civilians … on both sides”.
