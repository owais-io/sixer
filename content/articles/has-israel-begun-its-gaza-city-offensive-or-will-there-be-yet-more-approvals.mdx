  Has Israel begun its expanded offensive in Gaza City, or is it hype? After
  several weeks of threats of a new large-scale offensive, strongly opposed by
  most of the international community, Israeli officials have made announcements
  daily saying the plan to occupy Gaza City has been “approved”; it has been
  approved by the Israel Defense Forces, by the security cabinet, by the defence
  minister. Later on Thursday in an event with the Israeli military, the prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also proffered his “approval”, while
  simultaneously ordering the beginning of immediate negotiations to release the
  remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza. How many times, one is tempted to ask,
  does one plan need approving? As so often in dealing with Israeli officials,
  and Netanyahu in particular, filtering out what is true and what is not, and
  what is calculated misdirection, is a complicated business. While Reuters
  reported a junior defence spokesperson as suggesting that the operation to
  take Gaza City had begun, quotes from that briefing paint a more complex
  picture, including a reference to the second phase of Operation Gideon’s
  Chariots, the Israeli military offensive that began in May. Recent military
  activity in Gaza was depicted as being “preliminary” to any new offensive. For
  his part, Netanyahu’s office put out an opaque statement saying he had asked
  for planning timelines for an expanded Gaza City operation to be accelerated.
  Given the profound divisions within Israeli society, with about 400,000 people
  demonstrating recently in favour of a ceasefire deal and release of the
  remaining 20 living hostages in Gaza, and continued contact between mediators
  and Israel and Hamas, unpacking the politics of what Netanyahu is up to is
  tricky. On the one hand, far-right members of his coalition have threatened
  once again to walk away in the event of a ceasefire, demanding the conquest of
  all of Gaza and then Jewish settlement of the coastal strip. On the other is
  the fact that ceasefire talks are continuing. This week Hamas said it had
  accepted a ceasefire proposal that would allow for the release of about 10
  living hostages in the first phase of a 60-day pause, while senior Israeli
  officials – but not an official “delegation” – have met mediators even as
  Netanyahu has dragged his feet over giving Israel’s reply, reportedly delaying
  a cabinet meeting at which it would have been discussed. All of which leaves
  big questions unanswered. While some Israeli and international analysts have
  speculated that the current moves on the ground amount to pressure on Hamas to
  improve any deal that might just be emerging, others – including Ronen
  Bergman, one of Israel’s most authoritative security analysts – suggest that
  Netanyahu would like to push on with fighting for years in order to delay his
  ongoing legal cases and ensure his continued political survival. What most
  agree is that any major new campaign is likely to have serious consequences.
  For Israelis, including senior figures in the defence establishment, one
  concern is whether living hostages would survive, an issue motivating mass
  demonstrations. Others point out that, to all intents and purposes, the deal
  to which Hamas has agreed is one Israel signalled its agreement to only weeks
  ago. Any offensive would be seen by the international community for what it
  is: the most cynical of moves that would lead to an even deeper humanitarian
  catastrophe – if that can even be imagined.
