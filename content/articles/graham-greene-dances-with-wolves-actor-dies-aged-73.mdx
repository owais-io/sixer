  Graham Greene, the prolific Oscar-nominated Canadian First Nations actor and
  Hollywood trailblazer, has died aged 73 in a Toronto hospital after a long
  illness. “He was a great man of morals, ethics and character and will be
  eternally missed,” Greene’s agent, Michael Greene (no relation), told
  Deadline. “You are finally free.” Greene was born in 1952 in Ohsweken, on the
  Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, Canada. He fell into acting while working as a
  recording engineer, after a friend persuaded him to read his script. He
  started on stage, performing in Canadian and English productions in the 1970s,
  before making his screen debut in 1979 in an episode of the Canadian drama The
  Great Detective. His first film role was in the 1983 biopic Running Brave.
  Greene’s Hollywood breakthrough came when Kevin Costner cast him as real-life
  Lakota Sioux medicine man Kicking Bird (Ziŋtká Nagwáka) in his Academy
  Award-winning 1990 western Dances with Wolves. Greene’s performance landed him
  an Academy Award nomination and launched his Hollywood career, which included
  roles in Thunderheart (1992), Maverick (1994), Die Hard with a Vengeance
  (1995), The Green Mile (1999) and The Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009). More
  recently, Greene appeared in Taika Waititi’s FX series Reservation Dogs, HBO’s
  dystopian series The Last Of Us and Taylor Sheridan’s series 1883 and Tulsa
  King. Prolific across his career, he worked until the end, with multiple
  projects yet to be released. Greene won Grammy, Gemini and Canadian Screen
  awards across his career and has a star on Canada’s Walk of Fame. In June he
  received the Canadian governor general’s performing arts award for lifetime
  achievement. Reflecting on his career in a 2024 interview for Canada’s Theatre
  Museum, Greene said: “When I first started out in the business, it was a very
  strange thing where they’d hand you the script where you had to speak the way
  they thought native people spoke. And in order to get my foot in the door a
  little further, I did it. I went along with it for a while … You gotta look
  stoic. Don’t smile … you gotta grunt a lot. “I don’t know anybody who behaves
  like that. Native people have an incredible sense of humour. “And that’s what
  I said to Kevin [Costner]. I said, you know, the people in this film [Dances
  with Wolves], in this village, they have an incredible family, incredible
  relationship and fun has always been part of that. Fun is 50% of how they live
  and enjoy things. Family is family, no matter what.” Greene is survived by his
  wife of 35 years, Hilary Blackmore, his daughter, Lilly Lazare-Greene, and
  grandson Tarlo.
