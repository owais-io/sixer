  The US coast guard says a third child has died nearly a week after a barge
  struck and sank a boat during a sailing camp near Miami. Six people on the
  sailboat were pulled from the water after the 28 July collision, and four
  children were hospitalized before two girls were pronounced dead. A third girl
  – aged 10 and initially hospitalized in critical condition – died on Sunday,
  according to a coast guard statement. The local medical examiner’s office has
  identified two of the girls who died after the crash as Mila Yankelevich,
  seven, and Erin Ko, 13. CBS Miami reported that the girl who died on Sunday
  was Ari Buchman. “Our hearts continue to mourn with all those [affected] by
  Monday’s tragic incident, especially with the passing of another one of
  Miami’s children today,” Capt Frank Florio of the coast guard said. Salvage
  operations began on Tuesday. “The coast guard remains committed to conducting
  a thorough investigation to ensure all facts are uncovered,” Florio said. The
  collision between a barge and the sailboat occurred in Biscayne Bay, between
  Miami and Miami Beach. Everyone on the sailboat, a teenage sailing camp
  counselor and five children, ended up in the water. They were in their last
  week of a camp for children aged seven to 15, according to the Miami Yacht
  Club. An eight-year-old girl on the struck boat was in critical condition as
  of Tuesday. A 19-year-old woman and a 12-year-old girl were rescued but not
  hospitalized. Across the US last year, there were more than 550 deaths in
  recreational boating, but only a sliver of those – 43 – were caused by vessels
  crashing into each other, according to coast guard statistics. The Associated
  Press contributed reporting
