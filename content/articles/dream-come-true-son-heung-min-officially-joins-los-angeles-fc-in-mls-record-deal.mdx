  Son Heung-min has arrived at Los Angeles FC with great excitement and even
  greater ambitions for the next stage of his groundbreaking soccer career. “I’m
  here to win, and I will perform,” Son said at a packed news conference. “I
  will definitely show you something exciting ... are we calling it football or
  soccer? I will definitely show some exciting football, and we definitely will
  have success.” LAFC formally introduced their new forward Wednesday at BMO
  Stadium, where his likeness already looms over the main entrance gates and on
  video boards surrounding the stadium. The 33-year-old South Korean superstar
  is back on the Pacific Rim after a professional career spent in Europe,
  including the past decade at Tottenham. “What can I say? Dream come true. LA,
  what a city,” said Son, who will wear No 7 in black and gold. Son joined Los
  Angeles FC for a record Major League Soccer transfer fee, ending his lengthy
  stint at the Premier League club. Financial details of the transfer were not
  disclosed by either club but the Athletic reported LAFC paid a fee in the
  region of $26.5m. Son had suitors from around the globe after he decided to
  leave Spurs, and he said the decision to join LAFC initially wasn’t obvious.
  He came around to the idea of moving to MLS after conversations with LAFC
  general manager John Thorrington, who sold Son on the eight-year-old club’s
  ambition to be an international brand and the most successful club in North
  America. “If I’m honest, it was not my first choice,” Son said. “But [from
  the] first call when I talked to John after the season finished, he just
  changed my mind. He changed my heart. He changed my brain. He showed me the
  destination where I should be. Right now, I’m here. I’m more than happy.” Son
  laughingly said he was also pitched aggressively by Hugo Lloris, his longtime
  teammate at Tottenham who is now LAFC’s starting goalkeeper. Son is South
  Korea’s most popular athlete, and he is widely considered to be the greatest
  Asian soccer player in history. He said he already feels at home in Los
  Angeles, which has the world’s largest ethnic Korean population outside Korea
  and a robust base of soccer fans from all backgrounds who appreciate his
  accomplishments. Son’s introductory news conference was attended by Los
  Angeles mayor Karen Bass, South Korea’s consul general, several additional
  politicians, dozens of Korean journalists and dozens of drum-beating, singing
  fans from the LAFC supporters’ group famous for its relentless, raucous noise
  during matches. Son already got a taste of LAFC fans’ passion Tuesday when he
  attended the club’s Leagues Cup victory over Tigres. “On behalf of millions of
  Angelenos and soccer fans around the world – Sonny, welcome to Los Angeles,”
  Bass said. “This is a moment that will be remembered in the city for
  generations to come.” Son joins a lengthy list of soccer stars from European
  leagues who moved to Hollywood for a second act in their careers. Gareth Bale,
  Giorgio Chiellini and Olivier Giroud have all suited up for LAFC, while the
  crosstown rival LA Galaxy have welcomed even more European superstars,
  including David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robbie Keane and Marco Reus. Son
  did not appear to be in decline during the past season as Tottenham’s captain,
  and he said he is in good game shape after participating in Spurs’ summer tour
  of Asia. He did not set a date for his LAFC debut, but it could be this month.
  “I just felt like I need a new chapter, I need a new challenge, and I choose
  LAFC,” Son said. “I think we can say I’m old, but I still have a good
  physicality, good legs, and still have a good quality. I’m here to perform,
  but also I want to give some advice to the young players for improvement.
  That’s why we are here.”
