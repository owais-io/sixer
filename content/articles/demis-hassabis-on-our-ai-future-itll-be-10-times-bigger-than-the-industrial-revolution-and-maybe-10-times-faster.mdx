  If you have a mental image of a Nobel prizewinner, Demis Hassabis probably
  doesn’t fit it. Relatively young (he’s 49), mixed race (his father is
  Greek-Cypriot, his mother Chinese-Singaporean), state-educated, he didn’t
  exactly look out of place receiving his medal from the king of Sweden in
  December, amid a sea of grey-haired men, but it was “very surreal”, he admits.
  “I’m really bad at enjoying the moment. I’ve won prizes in the past, and I’m
  always thinking , ‘What’s the next thing?’ But this one was really special.
  It’s something you dream about as a kid.” Well, maybe not you, but certainly
  him. Hassabis was marked out as exceptional from a young age – he was a chess
  prodigy when he was four. Today, arguably, he’s one of the most important
  people in the world. As head of Google DeepMind, the tech giant’s artificial
  intelligence arm, he’s driving, if not necessarily steering, what promises to
  be the most significant technological revolution of our lifetimes. As such,
  Hassabis finds himself in the position of being both a booster for AI and an
  apologist for it. The Nobel prize in chemistry was proof of the benefits AI
  can bring: DeepMind’s AlphaFold database was able to predict the
  hitherto-unfathomable structures of proteins, the building blocks of life – a
  breakthrough that could lead to myriad medical advances. At the same time,
  fears are ever growing about the AI future that Google is helping to usher in.
  Being an AI ambassador is the part Hassabis didn’t dream about. “If I’d had my
  way, we would have left it in the lab for longer and done more things like
  AlphaFold, maybe cured cancer or something like that,” he says. “But it is
  what it is, and there’s some benefits to that. It’s great that everyone gets
  to play around with the latest AI and feel for themselves what it’s like.
  That’s useful for society, actually, to kind of normalise it and adapt to it,
  and for governments to be discussing it … I guess I have to speak up on,
  especially, the scientific side of how we should approach this, and think
  about the unknowns and how we can make them less unknown.” In person Hassabis
  is a mix of down-to-earth approachability and polished professionalism. Trim
  and well groomed, dressed entirely in black, he wears two watches: one a smart
  watch, the other an analogue dress watch (smart but not too flashy). He gives
  the impression of someone in a hurry. We’re speaking in his office at
  DeepMind’s London headquarters. On the walls outside are signed chess boards
  from greats such as Garry Kasparov, Magnus Carlsen and Judit Polgár. He still
  plays; there’s a board set up on a table nearby. It was the chess that started
  Hassabis down the path of thinking about thinking. Between the ages of four
  and 13 he played competitively in England junior teams. “When you do that at
  such a young age, it’s very formative for the way your brain works. A lot of
  the way I think is influenced by strategic thinking from chess, and dealing
  with pressure.” On paper there’s little else about Hassabis’s background that
  foretold his future. His family are more on the arty side: “My dad’s just
  finished composing a musical play in his retirement, which he staged at an
  arthouse theatre in north London. My sister’s a composer, so I’m kind of the
  outlier of the family.” They weren’t poor, but not super-wealthy. He moved
  between various state schools in north London, and was homeschooled for a few
  years. He was also a bit of an outsider at school, he says, but he seems to
  have known exactly where he was going. His childhood heroes were scientific
  pioneers such as Alan Turing and Richard Feynman. He spent his chess winnings
  on early home computers such as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and a Commodore
  Amiga, and learned to code. “There were few people that were interested in
  computers in the late 80s. There was a group of us that used to hack around,
  making games and other stuff, and then that became my next career after
  chess.” In the 90s, the games industry was already working with AI. When he
  was 17, he coded the hit game Theme Park, in which players had to build a
  virtual amusement park. “The game reacted to how you were playing it,” he
  says. Put a food stall too close to the rollercoaster exit and your virtual
  punters would start throwing up. After studying computer science at the
  University of Cambridge, then a PhD at University College London in
  neuroscience, he set up DeepMind in 2010 with Shane Legg, a fellow
  postdoctoral neuroscientist, and Mustafa Suleyman, a former schoolmate and a
  friend of his younger brother. The mission was straightforward, Hassabis says:
  “Solve intelligence and then use it to solve everything else.” DeepMind soon
  caught Silicon Valley’s attention. In 2014 the team showed off an AI that
  learned to master Atari video games such as Breakout, without any prior
  knowledge. Interest started to come from now-familiar tech players, including
  Peter Thiel (who was an early DeepMind investor), Google, Facebook and Elon
  Musk. Hassabis first met Musk in 2012. Over lunch at Space X’s factory in
  California, Musk told Hassabis his priority was getting to Mars “as a backup
  planet, in case something went wrong here. I don’t think he’d thought much
  about AI at that point.” Hassabis pointed out the flaw in his plan. “I said,
  ‘What if AI was the thing that went wrong? Then being on Mars wouldn’t help
  you, because if we got there, it would obviously be easy for an AI to get
  there, through our communication systems or whatever it was.’ He just hadn’t
  thought about that. So he sat there for a minute without saying anything, just
  sort of thinking, ‘Hmm, that’s probably true.’” Shortly after, Musk, too,
  became an investor in DeepMind. In 2014, Google bought the company for £400m
  (as a result, Musk and Thiel switched to backing the rival startup OpenAI). It
  wasn’t just access to cash and hardware that convinced them to go with Google.
  Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin were computer scientists like him, and
  “saw Google as ultimately an AI company”, says Hassabis. He also used products
  such as Gmail and Maps. “And finally, I just thought that the mission of
  Google, which is to organise the world’s information, is a cool mission.” From
  his office window, we can see the vast beige bulk of Google’s
  just-about-finished new office, where DeepMind will be moving next year. It’s
  fair to say the reason the tech giant is putting so much into Britain is
  because of Hassabis, who insisted on staying in London. “Our first backers
  were like, ‘You’ve got to move to San Francisco,’ but I wanted to prove it was
  possible here,” he says. “I knew there was untapped talent around. And I knew,
  if we were successful, how important [AI] would be for the world, so I felt it
  was important to have a global approach to it, and, not just, you know, 100
  square miles of Silicon Valley. I still believe that’s important.” In 2016,
  DeepMind again caught the tech world’s attention when its AI defeated one of
  the world’s best players of Go – a board game considerably more complex than
  chess. The AlphaFold breakthrough on protein structures was another leap
  forward: DeepMind has now solved the structures of over 200m proteins and made
  the resource publicly available. But the AI landscape shifted seismically in
  2022 with the release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which captured the public
  imagination with its uncanny ability to tackle a host of problems – from
  strategy planning to writing poetry. ChatGPT caught big tech off guard,
  especially Google. “They really went for scaling, almost in a bet-the-house
  sort of way, which is impressive, and maybe you have to do that as a startup,”
  says Hassabis. “We all had systems that are very similar, the leading labs,
  but we could see the flaws in it, like it would hallucinate sometimes. I don’t
  think anyone fully understood, including OpenAI, that there would be these
  amazing use cases for it, and people would get a lot of value out of them. So
  that’s an interesting lesson for us about how you can be a bit too close to
  your own technology.” The race is now on. DeepMind has become “the engine room
  of Google”, as Hassabis puts it, and AI is being built into every corner of
  its business: AI search summaries; smart assistant Gemini (Google’s answer to
  ChatGPT); an AI image generator (that can add in sound effects); AI-powered
  smart glasses, translation tools, shopping assistants. How much the public
  really craves this AI-enhanced world remains to be seen. Competitors are also
  raising their game. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and
  others are investing heavily, and poaching talent from their rivals.
  Zuckerberg is offering $100m salaries for top researchers. Suleyman, who left
  DeepMind in 2019, is now head of Microsoft AI, which recently poached more
  than 20 engineers from DeepMind. He hesitates to call his former friend a
  rival: “We do very different things. I think he’s more on the commercial
  applied side; we’re still focused more on that frontier research side.” That
  frontier to be reached is surely AGI – “artificial general intelligence” – the
  pivotal point at which AI matches human intelligence. “I don’t know if it will
  be a single moment. It may be a gradual thing that happens,” he says, “but
  we’ll have something that we could sort of reasonably call AGI, that exhibits
  all the cognitive capabilities humans have, maybe in the next five to 10
  years, possibly the lower end of that.” In other words, we are in the final
  few years of pre-AGI civilisation, after which nothing may ever be the same
  again. To some the prospect is apocalyptic, to others, like Hassabis, it’s
  utopian. “Assuming we steward it safely and responsibly into the world, and
  obviously we’re trying to play our part in that, then we should be in a world
  of what I sometimes call radical abundance,” says Hassabis. He paints a
  picture of medical advances, room-temperature superconductors, nuclear fusion,
  advances in materials, mathematics. “It should lead to incredible productivity
  and therefore prosperity for society. Of course, we’ve got to make sure it
  gets distributed fairly, but that’s more of a political question. And if it
  is, we should be in an amazing world of abundance for maybe the first time in
  human history, where things don’t have to be zero sum. And if that works, we
  should be travelling to the stars, really.” Is he getting too close to his own
  technology? There are so many issues around AI, it’s difficult to know where
  to even begin: deepfakes and misinformation; replacement of human jobs; vast
  energy consumption; use of copyright material, or simply AI deciding that we
  humans are expendable and taking matters into its own hands. To pick one
  issue, the amount of water and electricity that future AI datacentres are
  predicted to require is astronomical, especially when the world is facing
  drought and a climate crisis. By the time AI cracks nuclear fusion, we may not
  have a planet left. “There’s lots of ways of fixing that,” Hassabis replies.
  “Yes, the energy required is going to be a lot for AI systems, but the amount
  we’re going to get back, even just narrowly for climate [solutions] from these
  models, it’s going to far outweigh the energy costs.” There’s also the worry
  that “radical abundance” is another way of framing “mass unemployment”: AI is
  already replacing human jobs. When we “never need to work again” – as many
  have promised – doesn’t that really mean we’re surrendering our economic power
  to whoever controls the AI? “That’s going to be one of the biggest things
  we’re gonna have to figure out,” he acknowledges. “Let’s say we get radical
  abundance, and we distribute that in a good way, what happens next?” Hassabis
  has two sons in their late teens (his Italian-born wife is a molecular
  biologist). What does he envisage for their future? “It’s a bit like the era I
  was growing up in, where home computers were coming online. Obviously it’s
  going to be bigger than that, but you’ve got to embrace the new technology ...
  If you become an expert, kind of a ninja, at using these things, it’s going to
  really empower the people that are good at these tools.” Non-ninjas will still
  have a place, however: “We need some great philosophers, but also economists
  to think about what the world should look like when something like this comes
  along. What is purpose? What is meaning?” He points out that there are many
  things we do that aren’t strictly for utility: sports, meditation, arts.
  “We’re going to lean into those areas, as a society, even more heavily,
  because we’ll have the time and the resources to do so.” It’s difficult to see
  Hassabis himself carving out much of that time, between DeepMind, his drug
  discovery company Isomorphic Labs and his endless public appearances – the
  list goes on. “I don’t have much time that isn’t working, seven days a week,”
  he acknowledges. “I spend time with my kids playing games, board games, and
  that’s some of my most fun times.” He doesn’t let them win, he says. “We play
  very competitively.” He’s also a season ticket holder at Liverpool FC and
  makes it to “six, seven games a year”. He still plays chess online – “It’s a
  bit like going to the gym, for the mind.” And he’s a mean poker player,
  apparently. The night after winning his Nobel prize he celebrated with a poker
  night with Magnus Carlsen and some world poker champions. “In another
  universe, I might have been a professional gamer.” So, no fears about the
  future? “I’m a cautious optimist,” he says. “So overall, if we’re given the
  time, I believe in human ingenuity. I think we’ll get this right. I think
  also, humans are infinitely adaptable. I mean, look where we are today. Our
  brains were evolved for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and we’re in modern
  civilisation. The difference here is, it’s going to be 10 times bigger than
  the Industrial Revolution, and maybe 10 times faster.” The Industrial
  Revolution was not plain sailing for everyone, he admits, “but we wouldn’t
  wish it hadn’t happened. Obviously, we should try to minimise that disruption,
  but there is going to be change – hopefully for the better.” • This article
