  Bathing water quality across most of Windermere is poor throughout the summer,
  indicating high levels of sewage pollution, according to a comprehensive
  analysis of water quality in England’s largest lake. High levels of bacteria
  found in human faeces – Escherichia coli (E coli) and intestinal enterococci
  (IE) – indicating sewage pollution, were found to be highest in the summer
  months, when Windermere is used heavily by holidaymakers for swimming and
  watersports. The results come from the largest survey of water quality across
  the lake, which involved 350 citizen scientists taking more than 1,000 samples
  over two and a half years in the Big Windermere Survey. The results, published
  on Tuesday, include data on water quality from many areas of the lake that
  have not previously been analysed for water quality. The analysis shows that
  in summer concentrations of E coli and IE bacteria in the north-west,
  north-east and south-west areas of the lake – where some of the most popular
  tourist locations such as Ambleside and Bowness-on-Windermere are situated –
  were consistent with poor bathing water quality. Bacteria concentrations
  peaked in the summer, but the analysis showed high levels throughout the year.
  High levels of phosphorus were also found in sampling, with the north and
  south areas of the lake meeting standards for moderate rather than good.
  Healthy lakes and rivers should have low levels of phosphorus, to support
  plants and wildlife. Under the water framework directive, which governs the
  monitoring of UK waters, the government is signed up to a target to achieve at
  least “good” ecological status in all water bodies by 2027 – including for
  phosphorus concentrations. Only 14% of England’s rivers and lakes meet good
  ecological standards. Simon Johnson, the executive director for the Freshwater
  Biological Association, which developed the testing project with Lancaster
  University, said: “The evidence is clear and must lead to decisive action to
  improve water quality. We must all work together to transform the future of
  Windermere and deliver a cleaner, healthier and safer water body for all life
  to thrive.” The environment secretary, Steve Reed, has promised to clean up
  Windermere after criticism over the volume of sewage being pumped into it. As
  well as legal discharges of treated sewage into the lake by United Utilities,
  a BBC investigation found it also illegally dumped millions of litres of raw
  sewage into the watercourse. The Lancaster University survey found maximum
  median concentrations of E coli and intestinal enterococci were found at the
  popular tourist location of Bowness Bay, where levels were five and seven
  times the concentration respectively for all sites across the whole of
  Windermere. The main sources of bacteria and phosphorus are from treated and
  untreated sewage discharges from water company sites, agricultural runoff and
  private septic tanks. Around the Windermere shoreline, Waterhead,
  Millerground, Bowness Bay, Belle Isle, Mitchell Wyke Bay, the south-western
  shore sites, and near the River Leven sewage outflow, had consistently high
  concentrations of both phosphorus and at least one bacterial parameter.
  Johnson said Windermere was home to a number of rare and increasingly
  threatened freshwater species. “Without decisive action to improve water
  quality, this species and potentially many more will face a steady and
  devastating decline. “We hope these findings will not only advance scientific
  understanding of Windermere’s water quality but also play a pivotal role in
  shaping future strategies to protect and enhance the health of the lake and
  its surrounding catchment.” Matt Staniek, who founded the Save Windermere
  campaign, said the results were damning. “Finally we’re seeing science in the
  catchment that hasn’t been manipulated by vested interests or shaped by those
  taking money from the water company,” he said. “The evidence on the ground is
  clear and it confirms what local people have known all along: Windermere is in
  crisis because of sewage pollution. Now we need action from this Labour
  government following their commitment to end sewage pollution in Windermere.”
  A United Utilities spokesperson said: “United Utilities is wholeheartedly
  committed to playing our part in continuing to improve the water quality in
  the lake. Our teams are working at pace to complete multiple projects to treat
  wastewater to the highest standards possible as well as significantly reducing
  discharges from the six storm overflows that discharge into the Lake. This
  builds on our previous investment that has helped cut the amount of phosphorus
  entering the lake from our own operations by half. “We are also working with
  all other organisations and individuals that impact water quality in the lake
  to help deliver the step change we all want to see.” A spokesperson for the
  Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “This government
  shares the nation’s fury at unacceptable levels of pollution pumped into this
  national treasure. We have committed to ending sewage pollution into
  Windermere entirely, boosted monitoring of sewage spills nationwide and are
  increasing enforcement to hold polluting companies to account.”
