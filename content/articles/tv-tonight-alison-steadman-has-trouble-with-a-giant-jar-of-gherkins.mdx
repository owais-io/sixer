  Here We Go 9pm, BBC One The impressive cast of Jim Howick, Katherine
  Parkinson, Alison Steadman and Tom Basden star in the third series of this
  sitcom about the Jessop family. It might not be any of their finest comedy
  hours, but this week there are laughs as the gang dress up for a role-play
  weekend – and Sue has trouble with a giant jar of gherkins. Hollie Richardson
  Under the Bridge 9pm, ITV1 More from Lily Gladstone and Riley Keough’s
  underrated Canadian true-crime drama about the gang of teenagers who killed
  14-year-old Reena Virk in 1997. Police officer Cam (Gladstone) and writer
  Rebecca (Keough) have their own history to revisit as they delve into the dark
  motivations of the gang. HR And Just Like That 9pm, Sky Comedy Following a run
  of truly boring episodes, that shock breakup has woken us all up. Is it really
  the end of Aidan and Carrie (again)? Most of us hope so, but then again the
  prospect of her getting with the grumpy English writer downstairs instead is
  equally unbearable. HR The Secret Life of Trees 9pm, Channel 5 The arboreal
  facts come thick and fast in this sweeping series about our leafy friends. But
  because the narrator is Michael Palin, the overall vibe remains amiable and
  soothing. The notable trees spotlighted in this episode include a towering
  200-year-old Corsican pine that has twice survived being struck by lightning.
  Graeme Virtue Whitstable Pearl 9pm, U&amp;Drama It’s the annual physics fair
  in Whitstable! The perfect setting for a crime. Sure enough, a little girl
  goes missing while in her nanny’s care. When a local psychic says she can feel
  the child’s presence, private detective Pearl (Kerry Godliman) takes her
  seriously. HR Mrs Brown’s Boys 9.30pm, BBC One Here’s a fifth series for
  Brendan O’Carroll’s sitcom, which is most kindly described as divisive. Still,
  despite defying conventional notions of taste, it shows no sign of
  disappearing. Back in Finglas, Cathy is launching a podcast. Will Agnes find a
  way of gatecrashing and ruining this project? Phil Harrison Film choice My
  Oxford Year (Iain Morris, 2025), Netflix My Oxford Year comes with a terrific
  pedigree. Based on Julia Whelan’s partly autobiographical novel and directed
  by The Inbetweeners’ Iain Morris, this is a romantic comedy drama about a
  young American woman (Sofia Carson) who moves to the UK to study at Oxford,
  and finds herself being swept away by a handsome Brit (Corey Mylchreest). But
  what will derail their love first – her moving back home, or his dark, tragic
  secret? A slightly generic but admirably sincere exploration of relationships
  that come with expiration dates. And it’ll do wonders for the Oxford tourist
  board. Stuart Heritage Miracle on 34th Street (Les Mayfield, 1994), 1.05pm,
  Film4 Since Christmas in July is becoming more and more mainstream, it only
  makes sense that Film4 should get in on the act. A Christmas Carol is on
  today, as is Jingle All the Way, but the real gold lies in Les Mayfield’s 1994
  remake – which is charm personified. Co-written by John Hughes, the star
  attraction is Richard Attenborough at his twinkliest as Kriss Kringle, a man
  dragged into a court case after declaring himself to be Santa. What’s so
  remarkable is just how utterly festive the film is, despite being a courtroom
  drama about a potentially deluded old man. SH
