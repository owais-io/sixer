  The writer of TV’s Father Ted has been arrested at Heathrow over three social
  media posts expressing his views on transgender issues. Graham Linehan, who
  also created the IT Crowd and Black Books, said he was intercepted by five
  armed officers after flying in from Arizona and told he was under arrest over
  the messages. Writing on Substack, the 57-year-old Irishman said he was taken
  to a cell and then questioned over the posts, published on X in April. He said
  the posts related to him challenging a “trans-identified male” in a
  “female-only space”. Linehan said after questioning by police that his blood
  pressure “was over 200 – stroke territory” and he was taken to hospital and
  kept under observation before being discharged and released on bail. The
  Metropolitan police did not identify Linehan but a spokesperson said: “On
  Monday, 1 September, at 1pm officers arrested a man at Heathrow airport after
  he arrived on an inbound American Airlines flight. “The man in his 50s was
  arrested on suspicion of inciting violence. This is in relation to posts on X.
  “After being taken to police custody, officers became concerned for his health
  and he was taken to hospital. His condition is neither life-threatening nor
  life-changing. He has now been bailed pending further investigation. “The
  arrest was made by officers from the MPS aviation unit. It is routine for
  officers policing airports to carry firearms. These were not drawn or used at
  any point during the arrest.” Separately, Linehan is due to appear before
  Westminster magistrates on Thursday accused of harassing a trans woman, Sophia
  Brooks, and damaging her phone, which he denies. Legal and regulatory
  oversight of social media posts in the UK has become an increasingly
  contentious political topic on both sides of the Atlantic. US officials have
  expressed concerns over the Online Safety Act and the country’s
  vice-president, JD Vance, has said the UK is going down a “very dark path” of
  losing free speech. The case of Lucy Connolly, a British woman who was jailed
  after last summer’s riots for a post on X calling on people to set fire to
  hotels housing asylum seekers, has become a cause célèbre for the right. The
  Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, has said he will raise Connolly’s case in an
  appearance on Wednesday at the House judiciary committee in Washington, where
  has been asked to testify about online regulation in the UK and Europe.
  Connolly, who was jailed for two years and seven months, was released last
  month.
