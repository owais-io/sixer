  Wake up to the peril. As MPs return to parliament, they should abandon that
  self-deluding pretence that it could never happen here in our “moderate” and
  “tolerant” land. On the contrary, Britain is at more risk of a populist right
  takeover than many of our European neighbours. With Labour in an electoral
  slough of despond, and the Tories looking dead already, the reptilian grin of
  Nigel Farage haunts the political landscape after his satisfactory summer
  spent stoking division and cynicism. Our first past the post (FPTP) elections
  make us particularly vulnerable. As Rob Ford, professor of politics at
  Manchester University, notes: “This is now a Farage-friendly electoral
  system.” Reform UK has reached the tipping point where winning as little as
  30% support in our corkscrewed lottery of a voting system could propel him
  into No 10, however much that appals the other 70% of voters. “It’s certainly
  possible” he could be prime minister, was Farage’s implausible boast, a year
  ago. But as the latest poll puts his party on 35% to Labour’s 20%, it keeps
  getting a little more credible. As it happens, in the Commons on Tuesday, MPs
  will be voting on a fairer electoral system. Not, alas, for themselves in this
  most unrepresentative parliament in all history, where Labour commands almost
  two-thirds of the seats on just 34% of the vote. MPs tomorrow are voting on
  the more minor matter of restoring a fairer system for electing mayors in
  England, abolishing FPTP introduced in the Elections Act 2022 as a Tory
  gerrymander, returning instead to a supplementary vote system: a first and
  second choice. Expect sarcastic comments from the many electoral reformers in
  the house as the government solemnly explains why FPTP voting is unfair and
  leads to some grotesque results – but only when it’s a mayoral contest. Voter
  support for electoral reform in all-important general elections now stands at
  60% – its highest ever. People used to believe our system brought Britain
  strong and stable government, but the chaos of recent years has demonstrated
  that this isn’t the case. Since 2016, the UK has had six prime ministers, and
  among western democracies, UK cabinet ministers serve the shortest average
  terms. If once Britain once thought that its system kept the populist right
  out of parliament, it does no longer. Instead of being a barrier to dangerous
  outsiders it has become a springboard, catapulting Reform UK closer to power.
  Every Labour MP should study the new report from Compass, which analyses how a
  system designed to keep the lid on the pressure cooker of populism has become
  its dangerous enabler. With the old duopoly supplanted by five – soon to be
  six – UK-wide parties, having one winner take all and seizing the elective
  dictatorship of a Commons majority only increases voters’ political
  disengagement. Compass’s report, the Temper Trap, looks at the rise of
  populist-nationalist parties across the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Italy
  and Austria, and shows how their inclusion in coalitions under proportional
  representation (PR) forced them to moderate their extreme demands. Even in
  Italy, where populist-right voices are in the majority in cabinet, PR has
  softened their agenda. If the UK thinks itself a moderate country, analysis of
  its policies of the last 16 years shows how much more extreme it has been even
  than neighbours with coalitions that include the populist right. It has
  delivered some of the most immoderate policies in Europe: Brexit is wildly
  beyond anything done there. British policies on immigration, prison
  sentencing, deportations, austerity, deregulation, inequality and social
  justice were all delivered by radicalising a nominally “centre-right”
  Conservative party from the outside. With virtually no parliamentary presence,
  Reform UK and its spiritual predecessor Ukip transformed the political
  landscape. By way of contrast, look at Geert Wilders’ Freedom party (PVV) in
  the Netherlands. Despite winning the most votes its leader was denied power
  and the party had to compromise in coalition negotiations, putting to one side
  its positions on leaving the EU, banning Muslim schools and effecting mass
  deportations. It’s the same story with Finnish and Austrian populist parties,
  which negotiated their place in government by compromising on EU withdrawal,
  mass deportations and bans on foreign students. But, without PR as safety
  valve, Farage could take absolute power without moderating anything. Here’s
  the paradox: proportional representation allows populist-right parties into
  parliament but can stop them governing unchecked. FPTP keeps them out of
  parliament, but forces mainstream parties to co-opt their policies: see how
  the idea of withdrawing from the European convention on human rights is no
  longer a fringe issue. Labour, too, has undoubtedly been pushed further right
  by populist outsiders. No crystal ball can predict an election still nearly
  four years ahead. But Labour has the power and the duty to protect the country
  from the worst possible result, a hard-right populist government elected by a
  thin minority. The risk is substantial. It’s no longer in Labour’s
  self-interest to refuse a reform backed by nearly two-thirds of voters. The
  parliamentary group on fair elections, by far the largest all-party group in
  parliament, on Monday published its report calling for a national commission
  on electoral reform. “The government needs to get to grips with this,” says
  the group’s chair, Labour MP Alex Sobel. Keir Starmer could set up a
  commission right away and implement change before the next election. He’s been
  accused of lacking purpose, but here is a strong (cost-free) cause that would
  protect democracy. Labour voted for electoral reform at its 2022 conference:
  its national policy forum says FPTP is driving “the distrust and alienation we
  see in politics”. While over half the all-party group are Labour MPs, the
  cabinet has a few adamant tribalists who resist PR as it would force coalition
  compromises: that old argument for not watering down socialism looks pretty
  weak now that Liberal Democrats and Greens in a coalition would push Labour
  leftwards. I’m told Starmer and Angela Rayner are said to be flexible
  pragmatists, along with Morgan McSweeney, who would back it if it helped
  Labour. Rumours suggest Reform UK, pushed hard by Richard Tice, might start
  dropping support for PR at its party conference this week. That should alert
  any Labour reluctants to the peril of staying with FPTP. An election bill is
  due shortly, having been delayed by the departure of Rushanara Ali, the
  homelessness minister who had the odd add-on of democracy minister. Who gets
  the latter job, and whether it’s taken more seriously, may indicate Starmer’s
  intentions. If the bill lands with no promise of a commission on electoral
  reform, a great many Labour MPs will sign an amendment to include it – that
  would be a serious rebellion on a fundamental principle. Better by far for
  Starmer to seize the initiative and make this his political challenge to the
  right and his lasting legacy. Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Do you
