  It is hard to describe in words the pain of witnessing your people being
  destroyed for more than 670 days. It is even more unfathomable to contemplate
  another Israeli escalation, after witnessing so much suffering and so many
  crimes committed against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. How can
  this be allowed in full view of the world for so long? Will the world stand
  by? Israel’s security cabinet declared this escalation when it approved a plan
  to “fully occupy” the Gaza Strip and attack concentrations of population,
  starting with Gaza City itself. The consequences of this newest military
  onslaught are foreseeable and predictable. In May 2024, Israel attacked Rafah
  despite international warnings and in defiance of an international court of
  justice order – Rafah no longer exists. In November and December 2024, Israel
  attacked the northern towns of Beit Lahia, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya, and
  destroyed them in a campaign that former minister of defence Moshe Ya’alon
  described as “ethnic cleansing”. More recently, Israel unilaterally violated
  the ceasefire agreement, imposed starvation on the 2 million survivors and
  destroyed the southern city of Khan Younis. All these actions are in violation
  of the three rulings on genocide by the international court of justice (ICJ)
  in January, March and May 2024. The ICJ identified a risk of genocide in
  January 2024 and stipulated measures that Israel needed to follow to prevent
  the committing of genocide, including the unlimited provision of humanitarian
  aid. By all accounts, Israel has been violating these measures. An attack on
  Gaza City will be the latest phase of Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza.
  Immediately after 7 October, Israeli leaders, politicians, commanders and
  soldiers repeatedly said that they would destroy, burn and flatten Gaza. And
  they proceeded to do just that: Israel has effectively destroyed 90% of the
  Gaza Strip, turned it into a wasteland, and crammed the population into 12% of
  the territory, throwing them into dire humanitarian conditions that are unfit
  for human survival. By besieging and bombarding the territory, Israel has left
  no safe place for civilians and no way out of Gaza. An attack on the remaining
  concentrations of population in Gaza City or Deir al-Balah or al-Mawasi will
  mean more massacres, more mass displacement, and inflicting on the remaining
  desperate and starving population conditions that will lead to their physical
  destruction. What is Israel’s end game? Israel says that the occupation of
  Gaza will be “temporary”. But by now we are familiar with the Orwellian
  rhetoric that conceals reality and true intentions. We know that before, in
  1967, Israel started a “temporary occupation” of Palestinian and Syrian lands.
  It has become permanent. This is why the ICJ declared in July 2024 that
  Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza is illegal and violates basic
  and fundamental norms in international law, including the prohibition of
  acquisition of territory through force, the Palestinian people’s right to
  self-determination and the prohibition on apartheid or racial segregation.
  According to the ICJ, Israel already occupied Gaza even before 7 October 2023,
  thereby depriving Palestinians of freedom in their own homeland. This means
  that intent to “fully occupy” Gaza in August 2025 can only be a euphemism for
  something else in the context of this genocide. It means Israel is pursuing
  the messianic fantasy and the criminal enterprise of a “Greater Israel”, with
  the goal of “maximum land, and minimum Arabs”. This goal is also clear in the
  continuing forcible displacements in the West Bank and the calls to “resettle”
  Gaza. Benjamin Netanyahu is not seeking to free Gaza from Hamas, he is seeking
  to empty Gaza of its Palestinian population. Already in early January 2024,
  the UN said that Gaza has become uninhabitable. In early November 2024,
  Israel’s former minister of defence, Yoav Gallant, who is wanted by the
  international criminal court, reportedly said that there was nothing left for
  the army to do in Gaza. If so, what has the Israeli army been doing in Gaza
  since then? Israel’s intentions are clear. In January 2024, Netanyahu, another
  fugitive of international justice, doubled down on his longstanding rejection
  of Palestinian statehood, and an overwhelming majority in the Knesset
  supported his position in July 2024. In April 2024, the UN rebuked Israel for
  expanding the “buffer zones” in Gaza because it meant the permanent removal of
  the population. In May 2025, according to the Times of Israel, Netanyahu said
  that Israel was destroying homes in Gaza so that Palestinians would have
  nowhere to go back to and would be forced to leave their homeland. In July
  2025, the current minister of defence, Israel Katz, announced a plan for the
  ruins of Rafah that was compared to a “concentration camp” by former Israeli
  prime minister Ehud Olmert. In recent months, the main Israeli activity in
  Gaza has been the systematic demolition of buildings by well-paid civilian
  contractors. In light of this, you understand the true meaning of Netanyahu’s
  statement that “Gaza” (rather than Hamas) “will not be a threat”, and why the
  recent cabinet decision would reject a role for the compliant Fatah-controlled
  Palestinian Authority in Gaza. This is not about Hamas, nor about military
  objectives, nor about the hostages whose release Netanyahu has systematically
  sabotaged. Rather, this is a genocidal campaign that continues the denial of
  Palestinian freedom and seeks to impose Jewish supremacy, from the river to
  the sea. As Israel promises further escalation, it is fulfilling Israel’s
  finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich’s, monstrous promise in April 2024 of
  “total annihilation”. For decades, the west has failed the test of human
  rights and international law, as Israel has increased the brutality of its
  occupation and consolidated its apartheid regime over the Palestinian people.
  Western states such as the UK will not be able to wash their hands from
  complicity in Israel’s mass atrocities in the past two years. By granting
  Israel impunity from accountability and by arming this rogue state, the west
  has enabled these atrocities. Recent declarations about recognition of a
  Palestinian state are a publicity stunt and a distraction that conceals this
  impunity but highlights the lack of action. It is beyond urgent, and legally
  and morally required, that all states take immediate and meaningful actions to
  stop Israel, including sanctions, arms embargos, the suspension of trade and
  diplomatic relations, and support the international courts to bring Israeli
  criminals to justice. Unless action is taken, Gaza – as Smotrich monstrously
  put it in May 2025 – “will be destroyed”. Will the world continue to stand by
  and watch an unfolding genocide? Nimer Sultany is reader in public law at Soas
