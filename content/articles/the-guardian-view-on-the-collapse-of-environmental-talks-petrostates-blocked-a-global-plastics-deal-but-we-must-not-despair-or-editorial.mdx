  The Guardian view on the collapse of environmental talks: petrostates blocked
  a global plastics deal, but we must not despair | Editorial

  By ensuring the collapse of UN talks seeking the first legally binding
  agreement on tackling plastic pollution, blockers in Geneva have failed the
  next generation. Most states are willing, even determined, to act. But the US
  joined petrostates obstructing action. Their children too will live to regret
  that. To say that plastics are part of our lives from cradle to grave is an
  understatement: microplastics have been found in placentas, as well as blood
  and breast milk. While we can’t yet be certain of the full impact of the
  substances, we know that many have been linked to health effects and that
  foetuses, infants and young children are highly vulnerable. Microplastics have
  been shown to damage human cells in laboratory experiments, and a review
  published this month documented how exposure is associated with increased
  risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung growth,
  childhood cancer and fertility problems as an adult. Yet even as our awareness
  of the danger to human and planetary health soars, so does plastic production,
  which is expected to triple – to more than a billion tonnes a year – within 35
  years. Half of the plastic produced annually is for single-use items. In part,
  this growth is because petrostates see petrochemicals as their solution to
  maintaining demand given the shift towards renewables and nuclear in power
  generation. Three years ago, the prospect of a binding global treaty brought
  hope to all those concerned about the impact of plastics. But subsequent
  discussions failed and in Geneva this week, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and others
  insisted that action should be limited to tackling waste – which can only have
  a wholly inadequate impact – not curbing production and halting the use of
  toxic chemicals in their manufacture. The US insisted that only voluntary
  measures were acceptable. Rightly, that was not enough for delegates from
  “high ambition” states, which include those in the EU, Britain, Canada and
  most of the global south. The insistence on a consensus decision allowed a
  minority to prevent the action needed. It is deeply disappointing that no
  agreement could be reached, and that none lies in sight, though perhaps not
  surprising, especially when diplomacy and multilateralism are struggling more
  generally. Many of those attending concluded that no deal was better than a
  weak one which might allow the pressure for real change to dissipate. They
  will continue their push, though not necessarily through the same mechanism,
  given this second failure. Some think another UN forum might be more
  successful. We cannot afford to despair. Campaigners also note that it took
  eight years of talks to agree an amendment on hydrofluorocarbons to the
  Montreal protocol on ozone-depleting substances. Some hope that China could
  play a critical role in making a shift: it is one of the world’s biggest
  producers of plastics, but it is less reliant on them, and Beijing could
  benefit from being regarded as a leader on this global environmental issue. In
  the meantime, countries can and must take action unilaterally, and within
  blocs, to reduce plastic usage. Some, like Colombia, are already taking
  significant steps. If the record number of industry lobbyists in Geneva was a
  depressing sign of the entrenched interests that all who care about this issue
  must battle against, it was also proof that plastics producers know that
  change is possible and that the case for it grows stronger by the day. They
  have fought it off for now, but they must not prevail.
