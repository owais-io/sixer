  Two former longtime advisers to the New York City mayor, Eric Adams, have been
  accused this week of being involved in separate bribery schemes. On Thursday,
  the Manhattan district attorney, Alvin Bragg, announced the indictment of
  Ingrid Lewis-Martin, Adams’s former chief adviser. She is accused of accepting
  “more than $75,000 in bribes” as part of a “wide-ranging series of bribery
  conspiracies”, which prosecutors allege took place between March 2022 and
  November 2024 while she served as chief adviser to the mayor. Lewis-Martin was
  charged in four separate conspiracy indictments, alongside eight other
  co-defendants, including her son, Glenn Martin II, according to a news release
  from Bragg’s office. She faces four counts of conspiracy in the fourth degree
  and four counts of bribe receiving in the second degree. Last year,
  Lewis-Martin and her son were indicted on separate charges of bribery, money
  laundering and conspiracy. Both pleaded not guilty. As of Wednesday,
  Lewis-Martin was working as a volunteer adviser on Adams’s re-election
  campaign, according to ABC News. Lewis-Martin’s attorney, Arthur L Aidala,
  said in a statement to the New York Times that his client would be arraigned
  on Thursday and said that the district attorney had provided no details about
  the charges. “She has always served the city with integrity, and she will
  firmly plead not guilty to every charge,” the statement said. “While the
  specifics remain unclear, Ingrid is certain of one thing – she has broken no
  laws, and she is not guilty.” The new indictment came just a day after it was
  reported that another former longtime adviser to Adams, Winnie Greco, who
  resigned while under FBI scrutiny but had been recently volunteering for his
  re-election campaign, gave a reporter a potato chip bag filled with cash on
  Wednesday after a campaign event. A lawyer for Greco insisted the cash was not
  an attempted bribe. The New York City local news site the City reported the
  incident hours after one of its reporters said Greco had pressed a bag of
  potato chips into her hands containing a red envelope with a $100 bill and
  several $20 bills. The reporter, Katie Honan, had scrutinized Greco’s conduct
  in the past as a significant fundraiser for Adams in the Chinese American
  community. Greco’s attorney, Steven Brill, told the Associated Press that the
  situation was being “blown out of proportion”. “This was not a bag of cash,”
  Brill wrote in an email. “In the Chinese culture, money is often given to
  others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. And that’s all that was done
  here. Winnie’s intention was born purely out of kindness.” Asked why Greco
  wanted to make such a gesture to Honan, Brill said: “She knows the reporter
  and is fond of her.” The City said Greco later apologized, saying she made “a
  mistake”. “I’m so sorry. It’s a culture thing. I don’t know. I don’t
  understand. I’m so sorry. I feel so bad right now,” Greco said, according to
  the City. In response to the report, Eric Adams’s re-election campaign said it
  had suspended Greco from further work as an unpaid volunteer and that Adams
  had no prior knowledge of Greco’s actions. The City reported that Greco had
  texted Honan to meet her inside a Whole Foods store after they both attended
  the opening of Adams’s campaign headquarters in Harlem. When given the chip
  bag, Honan at first thought Greco was just giving her a snack and said she
  could not accept it but Greco insisted, according to the report. Honan left
  and later discovered the money, then called Greco and told her she could not
  accept it and asked to give it back. Greco said they could meet later but then
  stopped responding, the report said. Greco later called the City back and
  asked them not to do a story, saying: “I try to be a good person,” the news
  outlet reported. A City Hall spokesperson declined to comment. An Adams
  campaign aide, Todd Shapiro, said Greco holds no position in the campaign. “We
  are shocked by these reports,” Shapiro said. “Mayor Adams had no prior
  knowledge of this matter. He has always demanded the highest ethical and legal
  standards, and his sole focus remains on serving the people of New York City
  with integrity.” A text message sent to a phone number listed in public
  records for Greco was not immediately responded to. Since she resigned as
  Adams’s director of Asian affairs last October, Greco has occasionally been
  seen at his campaign events. Greco had served as Adams’s longtime liaison with
  the city’s Chinese American community. She was also a prolific fundraiser for
  Adams’s campaigns. In February 2024, federal agents searched two properties
  belonging to Greco. Authorities didn’t explain what the investigation was
  about, and Greco has not been charged with committing a crime, but she was one
  of a number of close aides to Adams who resigned or were fired amid the
  federal scrutiny. The City has reported extensively on the investigation and
  Greco’s conduct, including a campaign volunteer’s allegations that Greco had
  promised to get him a city job if he helped renovate her home. A separate
  federal investigation into Adams led to a 2024 indictment accusing the mayor
  of accepting illegal campaign contributions and travel discounts from a
  Turkish official and others – and returning the favors by, among other things,
  helping Turkey open a diplomatic building without passing fire inspections. A
  federal judge dismissed the case in April after the justice department ordered
  prosecutors to drop the charges, arguing that the case was interfering with
  the mayor’s ability to aid Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
