  community cohesion

  Images of Dover and the beaches along the Kent coastline have come to
  symbolise small boat crossings in the UK, often attracting anti-migrant
  protests as a result. “Everyone’s like, ‘Oh look at Dover, everyone’s coming
  here’ – they’re really not,” said Charlie Zosseder, the director of the
  charity Samphire, which works to improve community cohesion between migrants
  and local people in the town. “When we have issues, it tends to be people
  coming down from London because they’ve seen the news, think all the small
  boats are going there, let’s go and protest. Well, thank you, but no thank
  you. You don’t see many locals coming out for the anti-migrant protests.” Many
  people living in these areas have little direct contact with those who over
  the last 10 years have crossed the Channel on small boats and landed on their
  shores. Most are intercepted en route, or immediately on arrival, by Border
  Force officials and taken to the notorious Manston asylum centre nearby,
  before being sent elsewhere. Fishers and sailors in the Channel receive hourly
  VHF radio messages telling them to look out for small boats carrying
  undocumented migrants, but otherwise there’s little outward sign of the
  crossings that generate so much debate across the country. But behind the
  scenes, residents have formed networks of practical support in response to the
  growing numbers of people seeking help. In Margate, on the north coast of
  Kent, the Labour councillor Rob Yates said there was a growing number of local
  people keen to lend a hand. “We created a WhatsApp group for supporting
  refugees and we’ve now got an active 300-person membership,” he said. “If one
  of the refugees we know needs some accommodation, we post it on the group. We
  use it for finding people sim cards, mobile phones, clothes, and linking
  people up with private rented accommodation, which can be quite tricky.
  There’s an asylum seeker football team called Margate Phoenix, there’s English
  language lessons. “You’ve either got to work with these guys in your
  community, or they’ll be targeted by the county line of drug dealing, which
  they are, or by unscrupulous people who want to use them for nefarious means.”
  Last year, Yates spearheaded a protest that blocked Home Office coaches from
  moving asylum seekers from a Margate hotel to the Bibby Stockholm barge in
  Dorset, after being told by councillors there was nothing they could do
  locally to help. He said the lack of local oversight over the refugee and
  asylum seeker system, which is managed centrally by the Home Office, meant the
  treatment they receive is less “humane”. “I think part of the reason
  communities have to step up is because there is no local council involvement.
  So if we don’t do something, nothing will happen,” he said. “There’s one
  central office managing hundreds of hotels without any local oversight,
  without any local checks to see whether the food is OK, whether the
  safeguarding checks are OK – and they’re not OK. These hotels are badly
  mismanaged.” Kent county council takes responsibility for unaccompanied
  asylum-seeking (UAS) children who land in the area. It has had a record number
  of referrals in recent months, rising from 478 in 2020 to 2,836 in 2024. This
  year, it has already had 1,557 referrals for under-18 UAS children. The cost
  of their care is borne by the government, not the local council, but the
  Reform leader of Kent county council, Linden Kemkaran, recently wrote to the
  home secretary about concerns that delays in immigration decisions meant the
  council was having to pay for their housing and subsistence post-18. Kent
  Refugee Action Network, formed in 2003 as a grassroots response to the
  increase in UAS children in the county, has a mentoring programme to pair them
  with local volunteers. Over the years it has grown to meet rising demand for
  support, and now deals with 350 cases a year, helping with everything from
  immigration and housing needs to gathering secondhand bikes to donate to young
  people. “I think a lot of people realise that you’ve got to be vocal and
  you’ve got to actually do something to counter other messages that are going
  on,” said Lou Roberts, a new project developer at the charity. “I think we see
  a lot where people really go above and beyond because they want to counter the
  message.” Rishan, a former child refugee and now media ambassador for the
  charity, said it has become a form of family for many of the young people who
  have come through over the years, but there was only so much it could do. “As
  an organisation, we do our best to be there for young people, but there is a
  limitation in terms of what we can reach and what we can provide,” she said.
  “What with the Rwanda policy, now the one in, one out policy, they have so
  many questions and it’s hard to give a clear message.” Many volunteers also
  said an increase in anti-migrant protests had created a pervasive sense of
  fear that was hindering their work. “Unfortunately, with the rise of Reform,
  we are actually seeing an increase in racist behaviour,” said Zosseder. “It is
  getting harder. It’s harder for people to want to become part of a community
  that is shouting racist views at you.”
