  Merrilees Ritchie describes it as an “out of body experience”. It felt as if
  she was watching from above her kitchen table in Albany, Western Australia, as
  her brother explained to her that the pair of them had been adopted as babies,
  nearly 40 years before. Over a cup of tea he revealed they also had different
  biological mothers. They were not biologically related. “I was absolutely
  shell-shocked,” Ritchie recalls. “I’d basically lived half my life by then,
  believing I was part of this family I’d grown up with.” By the time her
  brother made the revelation, 32 years ago, their adoptive mother had been dead
  for 10 years. Ritchie had kept a photograph of her up on the kitchenette. “I
  looked at the photo and just thought: ‘You liar, you liar, why didn’t you tell
  me?’” After her brother’s disclosure, she has spent years jumping through
  hoops trying get hold of crucial documents that would help her claim back her
  identity. She even had to pay for her real birth certificate, since adoptees
  were given fabricated versions with their adoptive parents’ names on them.
  Ritchie is a late discovery adoptee, a term given to people who find out as
  adults that they are not who they thought they were. She is one of a number of
  people born during the secretive forced adoption era from the 1940s to the
  early 1980s, when thousands of babies were removed from their single mothers
  and given to married couples. For many late discovery adoptees, the truth is
  only discovered after an adoptive parent dies or by accident. Now Ritchie is
  part of the Great Southern Adoptee Support Group, calling for all adoptees to
  be notified of their adopted status. “It’s like a bomb going off,” says
  Caroline de la Harpe, a senior counsellor with the WA-based Adoption Research
  and Counselling Service. Suddenly, she says, grown adults have to navigate two
  different worlds, that of their adoptive family and their newly discovered
  biological kin. “That kind of turns their world upside down in terms of who
  they think they are.” The plight of late discovery adoptees was highlighted at
  a WA parliamentary inquiry into the forced adoption polices of last century,
  with its report released in August last year. Among its 39 recommendations,
  Broken Bonds, Fractured Lives recommended the WA government notifies all adult
  adopted persons not already aware of their adopted status. A system of
  automatic notification would be the first of its kind in Australia. Although
  no clear pathway for notification was outlined in the report, advocates say
  mandatory notification would tackle the ongoing harm to people who may find
  out the truth without warning or support, or are denied the truth about their
  origins for their whole lives. The recommendation was rejected by the WA
  government two months later due to its potential to “cause significant
  psychological harm and distress.” Bernadette Richards, associate professor of
  ethics and professionalism at Queensland University medical school, says while
  the argument about potentially traumatising unsuspecting people by telling
  them they are adopted is persuasive, doing nothing breaches adopted people’s
  fundamental human rights. Not least their right to know their family medical
  history. “There is also that risk there of benevolent paternalism,” she says.
  “Trying not to harm someone but taking away a choice. In reality, that’s what
  has happened to these people, isn’t it? They’ve lost the right to know
  something important.” However, Richards says comprehensive supports would need
  to be carefully planned to address the “real risk of harm” in implementing a
  mass notification system. “The age of these people must be respected, as must
  the fact that this is really something that goes to the core of individual
  identity and understanding of who they are and how they define that,” she
  says. Prof Daryl Higgins, a psychologist who has researched the impact of
  forced adoption, questions whether there is research to support the case for
  mass notification. Higgins, the director of the Institute of Child Protection
  Studies at the Australian Catholic University, says while adoptees have a
  right to know information about themselves, if they choose to, he is not
  convinced that all adoptees would welcome, or benefit from, being told by
  government authorities. Instead, he calls for a community awareness campaign –
  ideally a national initiative – to encourage people who have doubts about
  their birth status to access services that can help them find out in a
  supported way. Dr Ebony White from St Bonaventure University in New York was a
  co-author of one of the few studies in existence about late discovery
  adoptees. White backs the idea of proactively notifying adults, but supports a
  national awareness campaign to prepare people beforehand. She too underscores
  the importance of providing counselling and support to those who suspect they
  may have been adopted and coaching for adoptive families on how to broach the
  truth with their adult children. She also warns that for many reasons some
  biological parents do not wish to be found, and mandatory notification could
  lead to distress for all parties. That’s an issue also raised by Caroline de
  la Harpe of the WA government-funded Adoption Research and Counselling
  Service, who stresses the importance of considering other family members,
  including half-siblings. “Absolutely, [the adoptees] have the right to know
  information about themselves,” she says. “But you can’t just think about
  notifying that person because there’s a whole raft of people who are going to
  be affected by that notification.” The senior counsellor and psychotherapist
  says, for example, biological families would also have to receive support in
  advance of possible reunification. “Are you wanting a relationship with them?
  Are you willing to at least meet them and get to know them? So at least when
  [adoptees] are notified, you’ve got some information around their birth family
  and what the possibilities are for getting to know them.” So-called “contact
  vetoes”, which are lodged by different parties to adoption who do not wish to
  be contacted by each other, would also have to be carefully considered, she
  adds, with separate management plans put in place to handle those cases. About
  700 contact vetoes remained in place in WA at the time of the inquiry. For
  Ritchie, now 71, despite the fact that her reunion with her biological mother
  was imperfect, she is glad she knows the truth about herself. “I’m only sorry
  I wasn’t told earlier,” she says. Although she managed to find her biological
  mother, Nola, she says too much time had been lost. Reconnecting with her
  biological mother at a younger age, she believes, could have brought them
  closer. “I don’t think she could actually deal with the fact that I was back
  in her life,” she says. “I feel quite cheated. If we’d been given more time, I
  think she would have softened.” They never hugged or had any physical contact,
  until six hours before her mother died when Ritchie was able to visit her in
  hospital in Perth. “I just put my hand on top of her hand,” remembers Ritchie.
  “I don’t even know if she knew I was there, but I knew I was there.” • To
