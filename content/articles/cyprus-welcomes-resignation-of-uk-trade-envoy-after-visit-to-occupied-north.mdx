  Cyprus has welcomed the resignation of the UK’s trade envoy to Turkey, Afzal
  Khan, saying it sends “a resounding message” amid widespread criticism of the
  Labour MP’s recent visit to the island’s breakaway Turkish-occupied north.
  Khan had defended his trip on 8 August in a letter to the British prime
  minister, Keir Starmer, claiming it was conducted “in a personal capacity
  during the parliamentary recess”. But acknowledging the furore the visit had
  caused, the MP for Manchester Rusholme, who faced calls to resign, also said
  he felt it was “best to stand down at this time so not to distract from the
  hard work the government is doing to secure the best possible trade deals for
  this country”. On Saturday, within hours of the British government confirming
  the resignation, the Cypriot foreign ministry called the decision an
  “important development” that showed there could be zero tolerance for an
  entity recognised by no country except Turkey. In a statement it said: “The
  recent illegal visit of British MP Afzal Khan to the areas of the Republic of
  Cyprus occupied by Turkiye, as well as his meeting with [the territory’s
  leader] Mr Ersin Tatar were unacceptable and provocative actions.” The episode
  had, the foreign ministry added, sent a resounding message “that there is no
  room for tolerance”. “It is clear … there must, and may be, political
  consequences regarding [the north] … especially for those who foster, assist
  or tolerate it.” Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when a coup aimed at union
  with Greece, engineered by the hard-right junta then in power in Athens,
  prompted Ankara to launch a military operation in the name of protecting the
  island nation’s Turkish Cypriot minority. After years of inter-communal
  violence following independence from Britain, the two-phase invasion resulted
  in Turkish troops seizing 37% of Cyprus’s territory and triggering mass
  displacement, with the majority Greek Cypriot population moving south of a
  UN-patrolled ceasefire line and Turkish Cypriots fleeing in the opposite
  direction. In 1983, the breakaway north unilaterally declared independence –
  prompting Britain, a guarantor power, to immediately convene a meeting of the
  UN security council condemning the declaration as “legally invalid”.
  Successive governments in London and elsewhere have refused to engage in
  diplomatic relations with the entity since. Despite relentless efforts by
  Turkish Cypriot authorities to win recognition, only the international
  republic of Cyprus in the Greek-speaking south is acknowledged. When Keir
  Starmer last year made the first official visit to the island by a British
  prime minister in more than 50 years, Starmer refused to meet Tatar, instead
  holding talks with the Cypriot president, Nikos Christodoulides. Turkey, to
  this day, maintains about 35,000 troops in the north. On Saturday, Tatar, a
  hardline nationalist who advocates a two-state solution to resolving the
  Cyprus problem, decried the pressure put on Khan, saying the British MP had
  visited the self-proclaimed mini-state at his own invitation. “The fact that
  an elected MP was forced to resign from his position as the UK’s trade envoy
  to Turkey simply for engaging with the Turkish Cypriot people is a warning
  sign for all those who believe in democracy and equality,” said Tatar.
  Diaspora groups in the UK, where large numbers of Greek and Turkish Cypriots
  settled after 1974, said Khan’s visit had been especially “politically
  insensitive” because it coincided with the 51st anniversary of the invasion,
  the second phase of which began in mid-August 1974, as well as continuing UN
  efforts to restart talks to reunite the island. “Afzal Khan was right to
  resign as the UK trade envoy to Turkey following his deeply inappropriate and
  unacceptable visit to the occupied north of Cyprus,” said Christos Karaolis,
  who heads the National Federation of Cypriots in Britain. “His actions
  compromised the UK’s longstanding foreign policy on Cyprus, contravened
  international law and disrespected the lived experiences of our UK Cypriot
  community, many of whom are refugees or descendants of those forcibly
  displaced by Turkey’s 1974 invasion. We now look ahead to continued
  collaboration with HM government in support of a free and reunited Cyprus.”
