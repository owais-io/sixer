  Police overnight arrested the wife of Porepunkah shooting suspect Dezi
  Freeman, interviewing and releasing the 42-year-old woman and a 15-year-old
  boy “pending further inquiries” as the manhunt in Victoria’s high country
  continues. As the massive police operation to find the alleged cop killer
  marked its fourth day on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology issued an emergency
  warning for severe thunderstorms in Victoria’s north-east, including the town
  of Porepunkah. Freeman allegedly shot and killed two police officers and
  injured a third on Tuesday morning, and on Friday police again appealed
  directly to the fugitive to turn himself in and bring the search to a safe
  end. Victoria’s chief commissioner, Mike Bush, said police were “not leaving
  here until this person is in custody”. “If that person is listening, it really
  is time to lay down your firearms and give yourself up so that we can all
  bring this to a safe conclusion, and this community can get back to what they
  love to do,” Bush said in a press conference on Friday afternoon. He described
  the operation, which involves more than 450 officers, as “very professional
  and coordinated”. Alongside Australian federal police already in place,
  officers from New South Wales, South Australia and the ACT were on their way
  to the scene. Bush said officers in the field had “every resource they require
  to locate the person responsible for this horrific homicide”. “Our law
  enforcement colleagues and partners across Australia are leaning into this
  with us. They know the impact. It’s not just the Victoria police that are
  hurting at the moment, it’s the entire police family,” he said. There have
  been no confirmed sightings of Freeman, 56, also known as Desmond Filby, since
  he allegedly shot the officers when they came to execute an arrest warrant on
  him at a rural property in Porepunkah on Tuesday. Guardian Australia confirmed
  police raided a property in Porepunkah on Thursday night as they continued to
  search for Freeman, who vanished into the bush at the base of Mount Buffalo.
  Bush said members of the public had reported alleged sightings of the suspect,
  which police were exploring. He also said Freeman may have access to
  technology, making it unwise to share details of the exact search area.
  Victoria police on Friday morning said they had “safely” arrested the woman
  and teenage boy at a Porepunkah address at about 8.40pm. Police said the pair
  were taken into custody, interviewed and released, and that their arrests
  formed part of the investigation into the deaths of Det Leading Sen Const Neal
  Thompson, 59, and Sen Const Vadim De Waart, 35. Freeman’s location remained
  unknown, police said. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Victoria police have not
  confirmed how many properties in the area they have left to search or whether
  they suspect anyone of harbouring the so-called sovereign citizen or pseudolaw
  adherent. The Thursday night raid was at least the third raid on a property in
  the Porepunkah area within 24 hours. The house was quiet on Friday morning,
  but some residents appeared to be at home – with a note on the door saying
  “private”. Two neighbours on the street told Guardian Australia they had not
  heard anything while the raid was conducted, although one said he saw flashing
  lights. They said they did not know the people who lived at the property that
  police entered. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, on Friday morning said
  federal authorities would offer Victoria “every support that is required” to
  assist in the search for Freeman and confirmed the Australian federal police’s
  elite tactical unit had joined the operation. “What’s occurred here is that we
  have offered the premier, Jacinta Allan, every support that is required. And
  this is a full court press,” Albanese said on Channel Nine’s Today show. “This
  guy clearly is dangerous. He’s on the run and we want him caught and we want
  people who are traumatised in that north-east community of Victoria to feel
  safe again.” One of Freeman’s former neighbours told Guardian Australia he had
  an intimate knowledge of Mount Buffalo and the bush around it and that he used
  to spy on her, including with drones. Loretta Quinn, who lived next to Freeman
  in Myrtleford between 2017 and 2019, on the opposite side of Mount Buffalo to
  the site of the fatal shooting, said the local bush was “full on” but Freeman
  knew it really well. The Victoria police deputy commissioner of regional
  operations, Russell Barrett, on Thursday conceded the search for Freeman would
  be “protracted” and police were navigating “really difficult terrain”, which
  includes dense bushland, caves and old mine shafts. “It’s complex terrain, and
  it’s not something that we, even with our specialist resources, can move
  through quickly, because it’s it is dangerous terrain as well,” he said.
  Barrett also confirmed that the officers who came to arrest Freeman in
  Porepunkah on Tuesday were using a warrant relating to a matter that had been
  investigated by Victoria police’s sexual offences and child abuse
  investigation teams. Police on Friday were also continuing to deal with
  deteriorating weather conditions that were likely to make the search for
  Freeman more difficult. Bush said officers were used to working in bad weather
  – but admitted the weather “doesn’t help us – and I’m sure it doesn’t help the
  person we’re looking for”. Porepunkah is280m above sea level but the slopes of
  Mt Buffalo rise sharply from the outskirts of the town, with the summit at
  1,723m. A large sign had been erected on the road to the mountain, warning
  motorists that Mt Buffalo national park was closed. With additional reporting
