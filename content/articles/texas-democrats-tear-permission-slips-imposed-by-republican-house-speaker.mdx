  Texas Democrats are tearing up “permission slips” they signed in order to
  leave the chamber, joining state representative Nicole Collier ahead of
  Wednesday’s vote on the controversial Texas congressional redistricting maps.
  The slips are part of new surveillance protocols set by Texas Republicans in
  the house chamber, stating that Democrats would “be granted written permission
  to leave only after agreeing to be released into the custody of a designated
  [Texas department of public safety] officer” who would ensure their return to
  the chamber. The move follows a two-week quorum break that had delayed
  Republicans’ effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts to align
  with Donald Trump’s push to reshape the US House map in his favor before the
  2026 midterm elections. On Tuesday, Collier chose to remain confined inside
  the Texas house chamber until lawmakers reconvene on Wednesday, refusing to
  comply with what she condemned as a “demeaning” protocol. Collier was among
  dozens of Democrats who left the state for the Democratic havens of
  California, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York to delay the
  Republican-controlled legislature’s approval of redrawn congressional
  districts sought by Trump. When they returned on Monday, Republicans insisted
  that Democrats have around-the-clock police escorts to ensure they would not
  leave again and scuttle Wednesday’s planned house vote on a new political map.
  But Collier wouldn’t sign what Democrats called the “permission slip” needed
  to leave the house chamber, a half-page form allowing department of public
  safety troopers to follow them. She spent Monday night and Tuesday on the
  house floor, where she set up a live stream while her Democratic colleagues
  outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.
  Linda Garcia, a Dallas-area representative, said she drove three hours home
  from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he
  went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to
  the Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were
  parked outside her home. “It’s a weird feeling,” she said. “The only way to
  explain the entire process is: it’s like I’m in a movie.” The trooper
  assignments, ordered by Dustin Burrows, the Republican house speaker, was
  another escalation of a redistricting battle that has widened across the
  country. Trump is pushing Republican state officials to tilt the map for the
  2026 midterms more in his favor to preserve the GOP’s slim house majority, and
  Democrats nationally have rallied around efforts to retaliate. Gene Wu, the
  house minority leader from Houston, and Vincel Perez, a state representative
  of El Paso, stayed overnight with Collier, who represents a minority-majority
  district in Fort Worth. On Tuesday, more Democrats returned to the capitol to
  tear up the slips they had signed and stay on the house floor, which has a
  lounge and restrooms for members. Cassandra Garcia Hernandez, a Dallas-area
  representative, called their protest a “slumber party for democracy” and said
  Democrats were holding strategy sessions on the floor. “We are not criminals,”
  Penny Morales Shaw, a Houston representative, said. Collier said having
  officers shadow her was an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her
  movements. Burrows brushed off Collier’s protest, saying he was focused on
  important issues, such as providing property tax relief and responding to last
  month’s deadly floods. His statement on Tuesday morning did not mention
  redistricting and his office did not immediately respond to other Democrats
  joining Collier. “Rep Collier’s choice to stay and not sign the permission
  slip is well within her rights under the house rules,” Burrows said. Under
  those rules, until Wednesday’s scheduled vote, the chamber’s doors are locked,
  and no member can leave “without the written permission of the speaker”. To do
  business on Wednesday, 100 of 150 house members must be present. The GOP plan
  is designed to send five additional Republicans from Texas to the US House of
  Representatives. Texas Democrats returned to Austin after Democrats in
  California launched an effort to redraw their state’s districts to take five
  seats from Republicans. Democrats also said they were returning because they
  expect to challenge the new maps in court. Republicans issued civil arrest
  warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state on 3 August,
  and Greg Abbott, the Republican governor, asked the state supreme court to
  oust Wu and several other Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a
  fine of $500 for every day they were absent. Democrats reported different
  levels of monitoring. Armando Walle, a Houston representative, said he was not
  sure where his police escort was, but there was still a heightened police
  presence in the capitol, so he felt he was being monitored closely. Some
  Democrats said the officers watching them were friendly. But Sheryl Cole, an
  Austin representative, said in a social media post that when she went on her
  morning walk on Tuesday, the officer following her lost her on the trail, got
  angry and threatened to arrest her. Garcia said her nine-year-old son was with
  her as she drove home and each time she looked in the rearview mirror, she
  could see the officer close behind. He came inside a grocery store where she
  was shopping with her son. “I would imagine that this is the way it feels when
  you’re potentially shoplifting and someone is assessing whether you’re going
  to steal,” she said. Associated Press contributed to this report
