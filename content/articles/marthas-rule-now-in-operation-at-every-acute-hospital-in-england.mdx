  Martha’s rule, which lets NHS patients request a review of their care, is now
  in operation in every acute hospital in England, health service bosses
  disclosed on Thursday. The system has helped hundreds of people receive
  potentially life-saving improvements to their treatment since its rollout
  began last year. It has led directly to patients being moved to intensive care
  or receiving drugs they needed, such as antibiotics, or benefiting from other
  vital interventions. It is named after Martha Mills, who died in 2021 at the
  age of 13 from sepsis after a bicycle accident. A coroner found she would
  probably have survived if she had been moved to the intensive care unit at
  King’s College hospital in London when she began deteriorating. Martha would
  have been 18 on Thursday if she had lived. Martha’s rule became available in
  143 acute hospitals in England last year. But it has also been implemented in
  the other 67 such sites, which means all 210 acute facilities are covered. It
  gives patients, their loved ones and NHS staff the right to ask for a
  different medical team to examine the care being provided and recommend
  changes. NHS England’s national medical director, Prof Meghana Pandit, said it
  is having “a transformative impact” on how hospitals work with patients and
  their families when their condition is worsening. Martha’s rule helplines in
  hospitals received 4,906 calls between last September and June from patients,
  relatives or staff who were worried about care. That led to 241 people
  receiving improvements to their care that may have saved their life. “It would
  be Martha’s 18th birthday today, another milestone she has missed as a result
  of the poor care and hospital errors that led to her unnecessary death,” said
  her parents, Merope Mills and Paul Laity, who persuaded ministers and NHS
  bosses to adopt the system of independent review. “We feel her absence every
  day. But at least Martha’s rule is already preventing many families from
  experiencing something similar. “The figures prove that lives are saved when
  patients and families are given power to act on their suspicions when they
  feel doctors might have got it wrong and their voice isn’t being heard.” They
  welcomed the adoption of the system named after their daughter by all 210
  acute sites in England. “We look forward to a time when every patient in the
  UK knows about the initiative and has easy access to it,” they added. Wes
  Streeting, the health secretary, said Martha’s parents’ “tireless campaigning
  has created a lasting legacy that is already having a potentially life-saving
  impact across England”. Rachel Power, the chief executive of the Patients
  Association, said the fact that every acute hospital in England now offers
  Martha’s rule was “a landmark moment for patient safety”. Almost
  three-quarters of the 4,096 calls came from parents seeking help, NHS England
  data showed. Walsall Manor hospital rolled out Martha’s rule last year across
  its services for adults and recently extended it to services for children. Amy
  Blakemore, a matron in its sepsis and outreach response team, said that showed
  families and carers “are a vital part of the care and treatment decisions that
  are made for the children and young people in our hospital”. “Any concerns in
  relation to their child’s deteriorating condition that they feel are not being
  listened to can initiate Martha’s rule and they can get an independent
  review,” she said.
