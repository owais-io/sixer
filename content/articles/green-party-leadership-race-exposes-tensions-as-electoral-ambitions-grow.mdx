  The Green party will name its next leader on Tuesday after a fiercely fought
  leadership contest that has exposed tensions over tone, strategy and the
  party’s ambitions on the national stage. The frontrunner, Zack Polanski, has
  pitched himself as a bold communicator able to turn rising support into a mass
  movement. He is facing the joint candidates Ellie Chowns and Adrian Ramsay,
  two impactful Green MPs elected last year who are seen as offering a steadier,
  more targeted route to growth. But even before a new leader is named the race
  has raised a bigger question: can the Greens scale up from being an insurgent
  force to electoral contender without splintering along the way? Insiders admit
  the race has been unusually fractious, more so than past contests and slightly
  overstated. But in a party known for pluralism, a reckoning has been forced
  over how the Greens balance radical energy with electoral discipline.
  Polanski, who is deputy leader and sits on the London assembly, dismissed
  claims his campaign represented a “hostile takeover” from new members. It is
  “laughably absurd” he said. “We’ve attracted thousands of new members. That’s
  not a takeover, that’s success. We’re showing people that a new kind of
  politics is possible.” He framed the race as a genuine debate over ambition
  and messaging. “Sometimes Green contests have felt like coronations,” Polanski
  said. “This one hasn’t. It’s been a proper debate about what the party is for,
  how we communicate and how ambitious we’re willing to be.” Polanski confirmed
  to the Guardian he would consider standing in Hackney North and Stoke
  Newington if the current MP Diane Abbott was not allowed to run for the Labour
  party. “If Labour replaces her with rightwing lobby fodder, they’re gifting
  the seat to us,” he said. “I want to be one of the first Green MPs in London –
  whether that’s in Hackney or elsewhere.” While senior figures have openly
  criticised Polanski’s messaging, some party veterans are privately uneasy
  about what they see as a growing reliance on “fighty language”, particularly
  in contrast to the Greens’ traditionally calm, evidence-based tone. One figure
  described discomfort with “violent metaphors” and suggested the party had long
  prided itself on persuasion not confrontation. Another insider said: “Job one
  for whoever wins is to heal the rift. There’s been more friction this time,
  and while I think the differences are exaggerated, you need unity if you’re
  going to grow.” The race has also highlighted other strategic questions. Siân
  Berry, a former party co-leader and now an MP, said the key challenge was
  scaling up without sacrificing discipline. “At the last election we said out
  loud where our target seats would be and we stuck to them. The next leader has
  to decide: do we go broader and risk missing more seats? Or go deep and win
  fewer, more securely?” Neal Lawson, the director of the thinktank Compass,
  said the contest had exposed deeper dilemmas for the party, including whether
  it could unite and position itself for a broader role in a shifting political
  landscape. “They’ve ended up with a binary choice between a more small-c
  conservative version of Green politics and a more radical populist one,” he
  said. “If they want to grow they need both wings.” Lawson said it was a missed
  opportunity that Polanski had not run on a joint ticket with one of the other
  candidates but “that moment’s passed”. “The real question now is whether the
  party can heal that rift if, as many assume, Zack wins. “There’s a wider issue
  here which is how the Greens position themselves in any future progressive
  alliance. Alongside Labour, the Liberal Democrats or ‘your party’, whatever
  formations emerge, the Greens will need to be part of something bigger if they
  want to confront what could be an increasingly united right. “We’re moving
  towards two clearly defined blocks in British politics: a left and a right,
  each with around 50% of the vote. And it won’t be enough to have isolated
  Green or Lib Dem MPs if Farage or Robert Jenrick can unite the right. That’s
  the broader strategic challenge.” Chowns rejected claims the race had turned
  bitter. “I don’t know who has described it that way and I completely disagree.
  There aren’t major policy differences or big dividing lines. From my
  perspective it’s about tone and strategy and even those differences have been
  overstated.” Chowns said she and Ramsay offered a principled but pragmatic
  Green party. “We need to be clear, bold and outspoken but also credible,
  focused and effective,” she said. “That’s what Adrian and I offer.”
