  as it happened

  Sadiq Khan said Labour supporters would be “delusional” if they did not
  recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024,
  as he admitted its first year in office has been difficult. The London mayor
  told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe that Labour needs to “really
  pick things up”. Keir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to “impose
  immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in
  Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The letter urges the prime minister to
  “act now” to exert pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza and for an end to
  arms sales to Israel. Downing Street has suggested that Keir Starmer would
  back a Ukraine peace deal without a ceasefire as a precondition as the UK’s
  prime minister and other European leaders join Volodymyr Zelenskyy in
  Washington for Ukraine talks with Donald Trump. The watchdog that monitors
  government ministers’ professional appointments after leaving office has been
  criticised for clearing Grant Shapps, a former Conservative defence secretary,
  to join Cambridge Aerospace as long as he promises not to work on defence
  matters. Alex Salmond’s niece has accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her
  uncle’s reputation when he is no longer able to defend himself in order to
  promote her memoir. More than £300m given to English councils to help
  Ukrainian refugees into accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of
  them face homelessness. Patients in England now have greater access to
  important tests such as MRI scans and endoscopies in the evenings and
  weekends, the government has said, after increasing the number of community
  diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of hours services. Thanks for joining

  politics here. The watchdog that monitors government ministers’ professional
  appointments after leaving office has been criticised for clearing Grant
  Shapps, a former Conservative defence secretary, to join Cambridge Aerospace
  as long as he promises not to work on defence matters. In a ruling that drew
  scorn from political ethics experts, the Advisory Committee on Business
  Appointments (Acoba), which monitors and advises on the revolving door between
  Westminster and the business sector, gave Shapps the green light to become the
  chair of defence company Cambridge Aerospace. Shapps told Acoba that the
  company, founded three months after the Conservatives’ general election defeat
  last year, planned to “develop technologies to reduce risks to aviation”.
  Disclosures show he cited examples such as airport delays caused by drones.

  here: Official government statistics show 209 pubs were demolished or
  converted for other uses over the six months to June. The data, which was
  analysed by commercial real estate specialists at Ryan, show the overall
  number of pubs in England and Wales, including those vacant and being offered
  to let, fell to 38,780. It means 2,283 pubs have vanished from communities
  across England and Wales since the start of 2020. The hospitality sector was
  hit hard by the Covid lockdowns and soaring energy prices after Russia’s
  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The British Beer and Pub
  Association (BBPA) has urged the government to reform business rates for the
  sector. The trade association said reducing the cumulative tax and regulatory
  burden would help more pubs to stay open, leading to more investment and jobs
  while also protecting spaces that, for many communities, are the only place
  left to socialise. You can watch this interesting YouTube video in which the
  Guardian explores the reasons behind the closures of pubs and how they
  continue to function as key social spaces that can reduce loneliness and bring
  different types of people together in an increasingly atomised society.
  Downing Street has suggested that Keir Starmer would back a Ukraine peace deal
  without a ceasefire as a precondition. Asked if the prime minister wants a
  ceasefire back on the table after Donald Trump appeared to drop his calls for
  one following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Starmer’s
  official spokesman said: “We’ve always said we want to see a sustainable and
  just peace for Ukraine. “One that ensures peace returns to Europe and the
  Ukrainian people can live without fear of attack again, and an agreement that
  delivers that as soon as possible, but ends the killing and translates that
  into a lasting peace supported by security guarantees, would be a
  significantly positive step.” Pressed on whether that marked a change of
  position, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “We want to see an end to the
  killing. If you can bring about an end to the killing and bring about a
  sustained peace in one go, then all the better.” Alex Salmond’s niece has
  accused Nicola Sturgeon of tarnishing her uncle’s reputation when he is no
  longer able to defend himself in order to promote her memoir. Christina Hendry
  told BBC Radio Scotland on Monday: “If my uncle was here today, these things
  would not be being said. I believe they’re being said because he’s not here to
  defend himself, as he would have done with every fibre of his being.”
  Sturgeon’s political partnership with her predecessor as first minister, who
  died suddenly of a heart attack last October at the age of 69, dominates her
  memoir, Frankly, which was published last week. She describes tensions that
  existed between them long before their catastrophic falling out over her
  government’s handling of sexual harassment complaints against him, claiming
  that he opposed equal marriage, overrode her concerns about releasing the
  Lockerbie bomber and had several extramarital affairs. The former Scottish
  National party leader stood trial in 2020 on 13 counts of sexual assault and
  was cleared of all charges, although a pattern of bullying and inappropriate
  behaviour towards younger female staff emerged in court. Asked what she
  believed was motivating Sturgeon, Hendry said: “There’s been a number of years
  that these things could have been said, and the timing of it now where she’s
  released a book and is looking to publicise that, I think many people have
  thought that could be the case.” Sturgeon writes in Frankly that she
  “agonised” about “stirring up pain for [Salmond’s] wife and family” but
  concluded “I cannot let what he said stand unchallenged”. Conservative MPs
  have expressed frustration at their party’s “piss-poor” messaging over hotels
  housing people seeking asylum. Leaked WhatsApp messages show members are
  concerned that the party’s leadership is attacking Keir Starmer’s government
  for policies introduced by the Conservatives. Kevin Hollinrake, the Tory
  chair, agreed that an advert shared by Conservative Campaign Headquarters last
  week was “of concern” but insisted it would not be deleted. The WhatsApp
  exchange, which was first reported by ConservativeHome, came after the Tories
  launched an advert featuring a “list of perks” received by people housed in
  asylum hotels. It included housing and food “provided directly by the state”
  and clothing provided by the Home Office, which are offered to people who
  arrive in the UK and claim asylum. The advert also included other claims that
  have since been challenged as exaggerations, including claims of discounted
  Spanish and French lessons, free driving lessons and free PlayStation consoles
  for new arrivals. Lewis Cocking, the MP for Broxbourne, wrote: “This makes us
  look silly as we gave them all this too which is why we are in the mess we are
  in today. Completely unacceptable – they should be put in detention centres
  and deported.” His message prompted a series of shadow ministers to signal
  their support, with the home affairs spokesperson, Alicia Kearns, the foreign
  affairs representative, Andrew Rosindell, and the housing spokesperson, Paul
  Holmes, responding with thumbs-up emojis. Hollinrake replied: “Agreed. Do
  message me directly with anything [sic] other ads of concern.” Average renters
  in England are spending more than a third of their income on a home – with
  cities like London, Bristol and Brighton becoming less affordable, new figures
  from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show. People earning a median
  salary could expect to spend 36.3% of their income on an average-priced rented
  home in England in 2024, the ONS said. This means rent prices were above the
  30% threshold that the ONS considers to be affordable. It also marks an
  increase on the 33.1% of household income that average renters were paying in
  2023. Rents have risen in recent years for a number of reasons, including high
  demand outstripping supply, the pandemic and its fallout affecting how many
  people live and work, and buy-to-let landlords passing on increases in their
  costs caused by higher interest rates. Diane Taylor writes on human rights,
  racism and civil liberties More than £300m given to English councils to help
  Ukrainian refugees into accommodation has not been spent, while thousands of
  them face homelessness. Freedom of information requests to 150 councils in
  England, shared with the Guardian, identified that £327m – about a third of
  the £1bn budget – was still sitting in council bank accounts more than three
  years after Russia invaded Ukraine. Most of the funds councils have spent have
  been used to pay staff and partner organisations. Only £22m has been spent on
  temporary accommodation for Ukrainians and £15m to help them into private
  rented accommodation. Many Ukrainians struggle to find accommodation in the
  private rented sector because of the need to provide a deposit, something
  councils can help with but which some Ukrainians say in practice can be slow,
  bureaucratic and difficult to access. Finding a UK guarantor can also be
  difficult and those unable to speak English struggle to negotiate with
  landlords. You can read the full story here: Ben Quinn is a senior reporter
  for the Guardian A veteran far-right activist who was a key figure in the BNP
  was pictured feet away from Robert Jenrick as the shadow justice secretary
  controversially met protesters in Epping. Eddy Butler was seen looking on as
  Jenrick visited the protest in Essex where the police have been attacked in
  the past by groups of masked men. Butler, who was a key strategist on the BNP
  during its rise in the noughties and has been involved in other groups in
  recent years, is among far-right figures who have been involved in the
  protests. Others include Callum Barker, an activist from the Homeland party,
  which has heavily promoted the protests. It is not suggested Butler or Barker
  were involved in any violence. Jenrick also interacted with demonstrators
  including a woman with a T-shirt saying “send them home”. It’s not clear if he
  met Butler, but the far-right figure appeared behind him on a number of
  occasions. Lewis Nielsen, a spokesperson for Stand Up to Racism, which has
  been organising counter protests in Epping, said that Jenrick was willing to
  go on protests that were clearly attended by far-right activists. “These
  activists aren’t ‘concerned parents or local residents’. Jenrick is fanning
  the flames of the far-right by chasing Reform UK votes – and he’s giving
  confidence to known fascists.” The F-35 programme is an international defence
  programme which produces and maintains the fighter jets, with the UK having
  contributed components for both assembly lines and an international pool.
  Israel has used the jets to devastating effect in its deadly bombardment of
  Gaza, killing many civilians. In September, the Labour government suspended
  about 30 arms export licences for offensive use in Gaza, leaving 200 arms
  licences in place. It also gave a carve-out for equipment used in the F-35
  programme, saying national security required that the F-35 supply chain
  remained intact. The suspensions were due to a clear risk that Israel, which
  has regularly targeted civilian infrastructure like schools and hospitals and
  is accused of committing genocide in Gaza, might use the arms to commit
  serious breaches of international humanitarian law. The British government
  continues to struggle to explain its export licensing regime. Ministers say
  they have stopped the sale of arms, but it was reported in July that there
  were more than 300 licences in operation. In addition, analysis of trade data
  shows UK firms have exported thousands of military items including munitions
  to Israel despite the government suspending key arms export licences in
  September. As my colleague Pippa Crerar notes in this analysis piece, when
  defending its record the government points out that it has restored funding to
  Unrwa, provided millions in humanitarian assistance, sanctioned far-right
  Israeli ministers and those who committed settler violence, and broken off
  trade negotiations with Israel. But these moves are simply seen by many as
  inadequate in the face of the scale of the human suffering and death caused by
  Israel during the most recent war, which was triggered by the Hamas-led 7
  October attack on southern Israel in 2023, in which about 1,200 people were
  killed and 250 others taken hostage. Keir Starmer has been urged to recall
  parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed
  by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the PA news agency is
  reporting. The prime minister, always keen to stay on the right side of the
  US, has been accused of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin
  Netanyahu to stop his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to
  the territory and killed over 61,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are
  women and children, according to officials. The letter says: The humanitarian
  catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is both man-made and avoidable. It is
  characterised not only by relentless bombardment and destruction, but by the
  deliberate creation of conditions that are starving a civilian population. The
  blocking of food, water, and medical supplies has precipitated what UN
  agencies and humanitarian experts describe as a man-made famine; one that is
  rapidly claiming lives and inflicting irreparable harm on an already
  traumatised population.” It calls upon Starmer to recall parliament and impose
  sanctions on Israel and to “support a ceasefire and meaningful diplomatic
  intervention to protect civilians and secure a just, lasting peace”. It also
  calls for an immediate end to all arms sales to Israel, support for an
  “independent, international investigations into alleged war crimes, crimes
  against humanity, and acts of genocide in Gaza”. The letter also says the UK
  should use its “diplomatic influence to press for the unimpeded delivery of
  food, water, medicine, and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza”. It adds:
  The UK’s moral standing and commitment to human rights will be measured by its
  response to this crisis. We urge you to act decisively by standing against the
  man-made famine, the mass killing of children, and the broader assault on
  civilian life. The letter was signed by Northern Ireland’s first minister
  Michelle O’Neill, Alliance party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Claire Hanna,
  the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and the convener of the party’s
  Holyrood group Stuart McMillan. Other co-signatories include co-leader Lorna
  Slater of Scottish Greens, Alistair Carmichael from the Scottish Liberal
  Democrats, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth and Plaid Cymru’s Westminster
  group leader Liz Saville Roberts. The Times is reporting that the chancellor,
  Rachel Reeves, is preparing to strip back environmental protections that block
  infrastructure projects from getting under way, in an effort to boost Labour’s
  building pledges and economic growth. Labour’s Planning and Infrastructure
  bill is already in the committee stage at the House of Lords but the Treasury
  is reportedly preparing for another planning reform bill, with officials
  considering ripping up key parts of European environmental rules that
  developers say are obstructing key infrastructure projects. According to the
  Times, Reeves has said the interests of “bats and newts” are being allowed to
  stymie infrastructure and development projects, and officials are considering
  placing limits to judicial review that will mean people with environmental
  objections won’t be able to delay projects so easily. The chancellor,
  restricted by a set of stringent self-imposed fiscal rules, is desperate for
  economic growth and infrastructure is seen as a key part of that ambition. She
  is preparing for a difficult autumn budget amid mounting speculation over tax
  rises, as a weaker growth outlook, higher debt interest payments and a series
  of U-turns on welfare cuts contribute to a huge deficit in the government
  finances. Nicola Davis is the Guardian’s science correspondent Patients in
  England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI scans and
  endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said, after
  increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of
  hours services. There are 170 CDCs operating in England, which are often in
  shopping centres, football stadiums and on university campuses. Patients can
  access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at hospitals.
  The government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day, seven days
  a week – an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared with July
  2024 – with the hope that the service will allow patients greater and speedier
  access to diagnosis. The move to provide more convenient care is part of the
  government’s plan for change which, it says, aims to transform healthcare and
  make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of community-based services
  a key part of the approach. You can read the full story here: The former home
  secretary Jack Straw has urged Labour not to panic about the threat of Reform,
  who are riding high in the polls as Nigel Farage capitalises on the “small
  boats” and asylum backlog issue. Here is an extract from the write up of the
  interview he gave to the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot: In
  an interview with the Guardian, he praised Starmer’s intention to recognise a
  Palestinian state after an ultimatum to Israel – but defended the home
  secretary, Yvette Cooper, saying he would also have proscribed the direct
  action group Palestine Action. The British political veteran said he believed
  Starmer and his cabinet were “head and shoulders” above opposition politicians
  and would reap the rewards of a gradual improvement in the economy and public
  services, which would not come immediately. And he said the poll lead of
  Reform UK should not be taken as a foregone conclusion. “We have been here
  before in terms of an insurgent party leading in the polls. So I think it is
  the famous phrase – don’t panic,” he said. The former cabinet minister said
  Labour faced not only a terrible economic inheritance, but fundamental damage
  to the fabric of democracy by the previous Conservative governments, primarily
  Boris Johnson. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics.
  Despite winning a huge majority at last year’s general election, Labour knew
  it had a lot of work to do to regain voters trust and show government could
  work for ordinary people. The task was made more difficult as the party
  inherited a weak economy and crumbling public services underinvested in by
  previous Conservative administrations. So far, the prime minister, Keir
  Starmer, has failed to win popularity with voters, according to many polls,
  with a seeming lack of political direction and constant moves to appease
  Reform voters while Labour’s base quietly slips away. Starmer’s proposed cuts
  to winter fuel payments, his sluggishness over adopting a firmer stance on
  Israel’s war on Gaza and his controversial welfare reforms were out of line
  with much of the public’s attitudes. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told an
  audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe yesterday that Labour needs to
  “really pick things up” after a “tough” first year in government. Khan, who
  has been critical over the government before, notably over disability benefit
  cuts and ministers’ plans for a third runway at Heathrow, said there was a
  feeling that people “lent” Labour their vote last summer (in a bid to get the
  Conservatives out). The London mayor said Labour supporters would be
  “delusional” if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had
  since winning power in July 2024. He said: Those people that say it has been a
  great first year … I think they are letting the party down. It hasn’t been a
  great first year. There have been great things that have happened in this
  first year, around the rights for renters, around the rights for workers,
  around energy security, and I could go on. But as first years go, it has not
  been a great first year. Khan said Labour could still turn things around
  before its term is up and are equipped with a “great team” in No 10 led by
  Starmer, who he insisted he was not being critical of, although he conceded
  that the prime minister and those around him could be performing better. Khan
  – who is a Liverpool FC supporter – said if Labour was in a football match,
  they would be “two-nil down”. But continuing his analogy, he said that only 15
  or 20 minutes of the match had gone, with minutes still to play and to “win
  this game”. After over a decade out of power at Westminster, Khan also said
  that the party had “lost the memory of running things”. “It has taken some
  time for the Labour party, the Labour government, to understand how the
  machinery of government works,” he said. Much of today’s news agenda will be
  dominated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s crunch talks with Donald Trump at the White
  House. He will be joined by various European leaders, including Keir Starmer,
  who hope to coax the US president out of the pro-Russian positions he took
  after the Alaska summit on Friday. You can keep up with the latest
  developments in our Ukraine live blog helmed by the brilliant Jakub Krupa.

In addition, analysis of trade data shows UK firms have exported thousands of military items including munitions to Israel despite the government suspending key arms export licences in September. As my colleague Pippa Crerar notes in this analysis piece, when defending its record the government points out that it has restored funding to Unrwa, provided millions in humanitarian assistance, sanctioned far-right Israeli ministers and those who committed settler violence, and broken off trade negotiations with Israel. But these moves are simply seen by many as inadequate in the face of the scale of the human suffering and death caused by Israel during the most recent war, which was triggered by the Hamas-led 7 October attack on southern Israel in 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 others taken hostage. Keir Starmer has been urged to recall parliament to “impose immediate sanctions” on Israel in a joint letter signed by politicians in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, the PA news agency is reporting. The prime minister, always keen to stay on the right side of the US, has been accused of not doing enough to try to exert pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop his assault on Gaza, which has brought famine conditions to the territory and killed over 61,000 Palestinian people, many of whom are women and children, according to officials. The letter says: The humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Gaza is both man-made and avoidable. It is characterised not only by relentless bombardment and destruction, but by the deliberate creation of conditions that are starving a civilian population. The blocking of food, water, and medical supplies has precipitated what UN agencies and humanitarian experts describe as a man-made famine; one that is rapidly claiming lives and inflicting irreparable harm on an already traumatised population.” It calls upon Starmer to recall parliament and impose sanctions on Israel and to “support a ceasefire and meaningful diplomatic intervention to protect civilians and secure a just, lasting peace”. It also calls for an immediate end to all arms sales to Israel, support for an “independent, international investigations into alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity, and acts of genocide in Gaza”. The letter also says the UK should use its “diplomatic influence to press for the unimpeded delivery of food, water, medicine, and humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza”. It adds: The UK’s moral standing and commitment to human rights will be measured by its response to this crisis. We urge you to act decisively by standing against the man-made famine, the mass killing of children, and the broader assault on civilian life. The letter was signed by Northern Ireland’s first minister Michelle O’Neill, Alliance party leader Naomi Long, SDLP leader Claire Hanna, the SNP’s Westminster leader Stephen Flynn and the convener of the party’s Holyrood group Stuart McMillan. Other co-signatories include co-leader Lorna Slater of Scottish Greens, Alistair Carmichael from the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth and Plaid Cymru’s Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts. The Times is reporting that the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is preparing to strip back environmental protections that block infrastructure projects from getting under way, in an effort to boost Labour’s building pledges and economic growth. Labour’s Planning and Infrastructure bill is already in the committee stage at the House of Lords but the Treasury is reportedly preparing for another planning reform bill, with officials considering ripping up key parts of European environmental rules that developers say are obstructing key infrastructure projects. According to the Times, Reeves has said the interests of “bats and newts” are being allowed to stymie infrastructure and development projects, and officials are considering placing limits to judicial review that will mean people with environmental objections won’t be able to delay projects so easily. The chancellor, restricted by a set of stringent self-imposed fiscal rules, is desperate for economic growth and infrastructure is seen as a key part of that ambition. She is preparing for a difficult autumn budget amid mounting speculation over tax rises, as a weaker growth outlook, higher debt interest payments and a series of U-turns on welfare cuts contribute to a huge deficit in the government finances. Nicola Davis is the Guardian’s science correspondent Patients in England now have greater access to important tests such as MRI scans and endoscopies in the evenings and weekends, the government has said, after increasing the number of community diagnostic centres (CDCs) offering out of hours services. There are 170 CDCs operating in England, which are often in shopping centres, football stadiums and on university campuses. Patients can access them through a referral from their GP or clinical teams at hospitals. The government has revealed that 100 CDCs are open 12 hours a day, seven days a week – an increase of 37 CDCs with such opening hours compared with July 2024 – with the hope that the service will allow patients greater and speedier access to diagnosis. The move to provide more convenient care is part of the government’s plan for change which, it says, aims to transform healthcare and make the NHS fit for the future, with an expansion of community-based services a key part of the approach. You can read the full story here: The former home secretary Jack Straw has urged Labour not to panic about the threat of Reform, who are riding high in the polls as Nigel Farage capitalises on the “small boats” and asylum backlog issue. Here is an extract from the write up of the interview he gave to the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Jessica Elgot: In an interview with the Guardian, he praised Starmer’s intention to recognise a Palestinian state after an ultimatum to Israel – but defended the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, saying he would also have proscribed the direct action group Palestine Action. The British political veteran said he believed Starmer and his cabinet were “head and shoulders” above opposition politicians and would reap the rewards of a gradual improvement in the economy and public services, which would not come immediately. And he said the poll lead of Reform UK should not be taken as a foregone conclusion. “We have been here before in terms of an insurgent party leading in the polls. So I think it is the famous phrase – don’t panic,” he said. The former cabinet minister said Labour faced not only a terrible economic inheritance, but fundamental damage to the fabric of democracy by the previous Conservative governments, primarily Boris Johnson. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of UK politics. Despite winning a huge majority at last year’s general election, Labour knew it had a lot of work to do to regain voters trust and show government could work for ordinary people. The task was made more difficult as the party inherited a weak economy and crumbling public services underinvested in by previous Conservative administrations. So far, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, has failed to win popularity with voters, according to many polls, with a seeming lack of political direction and constant moves to appease Reform voters while Labour’s base quietly slips away. Starmer’s proposed cuts to winter fuel payments, his sluggishness over adopting a firmer stance on Israel’s war on Gaza and his controversial welfare reforms were out of line with much of the public’s attitudes. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, told an audience at the Edinburgh festival fringe yesterday that Labour needs to “really pick things up” after a “tough” first year in government. Khan, who has been critical over the government before, notably over disability benefit cuts and ministers’ plans for a third runway at Heathrow, said there was a feeling that people “lent” Labour their vote last summer (in a bid to get the Conservatives out). The London mayor said Labour supporters would be “delusional” if they did not recognise the difficulties the party had had since winning power in July 2024. He said: Those people that say it has been a great first year … I think they are letting the party down. It hasn’t been a great first year. There have been great things that have happened in this first year, around the rights for renters, around the rights for workers, around energy security, and I could go on. But as first years go, it has not been a great first year. Khan said Labour could still turn things around before its term is up and are equipped with a “great team” in No 10 led by Starmer, who he insisted he was not being critical of, although he conceded that the prime minister and those around him could be performing better. Khan – who is a Liverpool FC supporter – said if Labour was in a football match, they would be “two-nil down”. But continuing his analogy, he said that only 15 or 20 minutes of the match had gone, with minutes still to play and to “win this game”. After over a decade out of power at Westminster, Khan also said that the party had “lost the memory of running things”. “It has taken some time for the Labour party, the Labour government, to understand how the machinery of government works,” he said. Much of today’s news agenda will be dominated by Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s crunch talks with Donald Trump at the White House. He will be joined by various European leaders, including Keir Starmer, who hope to coax the US president out of the pro-Russian positions he took after the Alaska summit on Friday.
