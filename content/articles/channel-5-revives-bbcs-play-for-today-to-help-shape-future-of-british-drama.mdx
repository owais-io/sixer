  It was one of the most influential British television series of the last
  century, renowned for exploring thorny societal issues and bringing the work
  of emerging talent, such as Ray Winstone, Alison Steadman, Helen Mirren and
  Dennis Potter, to mass audiences. Now Play for Today is being revived on
  Channel 5, to give young writers, actors and producers from lower-income
  backgrounds a way into TV, helped by established talent. Continuing the
  series’ history of politically charged social realism, the first four
  productions cover a failing Adolescence-style school in special measures,
  celebrity and historical abuse, ageing and money, and feature appearances from
  stars including Anita Dobson, Nigel Havers, Sue Johnston and Alan Davies. The
  Channel 5 commissioning editor Paul Testar said Play for Today was “synonymous
  with high-quality standalone television dramas”. Its revival would help “shape
  the future of British drama”, he added, providing an “opportunity to support
  emerging talent behind the scenes – from writers and directors to production
  teams – especially those from lower-income backgrounds who haven’t always had
  clear pathways into the industry”. Play for Today was a BBC One anthology
  drama series that ran from 1970 until 1984, designed “to rattle the cages of
  the establishment” and famed for bringing Abigail’s Party and Rumpole of the
  Bailey to the small screen. It featured more than 300 productions, the most
  controversial of which was Scum – a prison drama starring Winstone that was
  considered so harrowing it was banned from broadcast and later remade as a
  film. The drama in which Dobson stars, Never Too Late, is about ageing,
  rebellion and independence. She told the Guardian it would resonate because
  “[we] live in a society now where older people are living much longer, so it’s
  really important, I think, that their voices are heard as much as young
  people’s voices”. “I hope it makes lots of people feel positive and hopeful
  that life is never over until the last bell rings.” She praised Channel 5, for
  “teaching people new skills”, and the young crew she worked with on the show,
  some of whom were on their first production. “The joy they brought to work was
  just fantastic. They were willing; they were eager. Nothing was too much
  trouble.” Dobson said Play for Today was “a wonderful institution” and lauded
  Channel 5 “for actually getting this kind of stuff on the screen”. “More of
  that in TV would be wonderful, where you’ve got something really great to say
  about society and life, which is important.” Although TV drama has become
  increasingly expensive and glossy, Channel 5 has received plaudits for
  attracting audiences with homegrown series, such as All Creatures Great and
  Small and the working-class period drama The Hardacres. Its slate for this
  year includes more than 100 hours of original drama, compared with a handful a
  few years ago. Channel 5’s chief content officer, Ben Frow, said reviving Play
  for Today “not only underlines our commitment to being a public service
  broadcaster, but also enables us to tackle subject matters that reflect some
  of the thornier issues affecting our audience, like the films in this first
  slate on a school under pressure from an Ofsted inspection, or the challenges
  of ageing. “Just as importantly, as the original Play For Today helped
  establish the careers of some of Britain’s best writers, directors and
  producers, so we want to do the same – with a particular emphasis on talent
  from lower-income backgrounds.” The first in the series will air later this
  year.
