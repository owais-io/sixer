  The far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson has been released on bail by
  police after being arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm. Robinson,
  42, was detained on Monday evening at Luton airport after a man was allegedly
  assaulted at a London railway station a week earlier. The investigating force,
  British Transport Police, said on Tuesday that the man they arrested at Luton
  airport had been bailed pending further inquiries until 2 September. Robinson,
  whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, was arrested after arriving at Luton
  airport on a flight from Faro, Portugal. The incident that led to his arrest
  and criminal investigation took place on Monday 28 July at St Pancras train
  station in central London. Police said they were called at about 8.40pm to
  reports of an assault. The man alleged to have been assaulted, aged 64, had
  serious injuries, police said, and needed hospital treatment. Hours after the
  incident at St Pancras station, Robinson took a flight out of Britain, landing
  first in Tenerife, Spain. Once abroad, Robinson went from Tenerife to Faro
  before flying back to the UK on Monday where police were waiting for him.
  Police said the 42-year-old man they arrested had been “wanted for
  questioning”. Video from the scene of the alleged assault, showed a
  64-year-old man on the ground and Robinson appearing to claim he had acted in
  self-defence. The video does not show how the injured man came to be lying
  motionless on the floor. The man was admitted to hospital with head injuries
  and was released two days later. Robinson is a former leader of the English
  Defence League. The far-right monitoring group Hope Not Hate describes him as
  the “best-known far-right extremist in Britain”. Announcing the arrest on
  Monday, British Transport Police said: “Officers from BTP have tonight (4
  August) arrested a 42-year-old man from Bedfordshire in connection to an
  assault at St Pancras station on 28 July. The arrest took place at Luton
  airport shortly after 6.30pm, following a notification that the man had
  boarded an incoming flight from Faro. “The man had been wanted for questioning
  after leaving the country to Tenerife in the early hours of 29 July following
  the incident at St Pancras.” The normal practice of British police is not to
  name an arrested suspect until they are charged with a criminal offence.
