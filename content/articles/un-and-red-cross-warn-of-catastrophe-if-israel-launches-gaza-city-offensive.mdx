  The International Red Cross and UN have warned of an impending catastrophe in
  the Gaza Strip if Israel launches an offensive to take over Gaza City, as the
  Israeli military told medical and aid groups in the Palestinian territory to
  prepare for imminent forced displacement. At the same time a concerted
  campaign of international opposition to Israel’s defiance of ceasefire calls
  and its approval of a huge new illegal settlement construction in the occupied
  West Bank gathered pace, with the UK summoning Israel’s ambassador and joining
  20 other countries in condemning the settlement plan as a “violation of
  international law”. The Gaza health ministry on Thursday rejected the Israeli
  military’s call to displace personnel in the north before a military offensive
  to seize the area. It said to do so would “deprive more than 1 million people
  of their right to medical treatment and expose the lives of residents,
  patients and the wounded to imminent danger”. On Thursday evening, Benjamin
  Netanayhu announced during a visit to Israeli soldiers in the Gaza division
  that he had approved plans for the takeover of Gaza City and ordered officials
  to begin immediate negotiations over the return of Israeli hostages in Gaza.
  “We are in the decision-making stage,” the prime minister said. “I have come
  to the Gaza division today to approve the plans that the IDF presented to me …
  for the takeover of Gaza City and the defeat of Hamas ... At the same time, I
  have instructed to begin immediate negotiations on the release of all our
  hostages and the end of the war on terms acceptable to Israel. These two
  things – the defeat of Hamas and the release of all our hostages – go hand in
  hand.” Netanyahu, who is wanted by the international criminal court over
  allegations of responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity,
  earlier told Sky News Australia that Israel intended to take over the whole of
  the Gaza Strip regardless of whether there was a ceasefire deal agreed with
  Hamas. The families of Israeli hostages have said such an operation would be a
  “death sentence” for their relatives. In the interview, apparently conducted
  earlier this week, he was asked whether Israel would take over all of Gaza,
  even if Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal. “We’re going to do that anyway,”
  said Netanyahu. “There was never a question that we’re not going to leave
  Hamas there.” Calling for an immediate ceasefire, the UN secretary general,
  António Guterres, warned of the “massive death and destruction that a military
  operation against Gaza would inevitably cause”. Christian Cardon, the chief
  spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said:
  “The intensification of hostilities in Gaza means more killing, more
  displacement, more destruction and more panic. “Gaza is a closed space from
  which nobody can escape … and where access to healthcare, food and safe water
  is dwindling. Meanwhile, the security of humanitarians is getting worse by the
  hour. This is intolerable.” Aid organisations say Israel has made negligible
  efforts to significantly increase humanitarian assistance to the levels needed
  by the population in Gaza, prompting a warning from the French president,
  Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week of the danger of a “true disaster”.
  Opposition to a new military operation – repeatedly “approved” by Israeli
  figures in recent days – is growing inside Israel and internationally. More
  protests are expected to follow a large one held on Sunday, and the families
  of Israeli hostages held a press conference on Thursday to call for Israel to
  agree to a ceasefire deal – already accepted by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic
  Jihad – which would result in half of the 20 surviving hostages being
  released. “We’re a step away from a total torpedoing” of a deal, said Lishay
  Miran Lavi, whose husband, Omri, is thought to still be alive in captivity.
  “There is an agreement on the table that could save the lives of hostages and
  return the dead for proper burial. “Hamas has agreed, but the prime minister’s
  office is working to sabotage it … You cannot conduct a 22-month war whose
  sole purpose is to preserve political power.” Representatives from hostages’
  families referred sceptically to Netanyahu’s repeated promises that Israel was
  close to victory. Israel’s increasing defiance of international opinion has
  pushed it closer to the status of a pariah state, both for the destruction and
  mass starvation it has visited on Gaza, and for its approval on Wednesday of
  the illegal settlement aimed at destroying any possibility of a future
  Palestinian state. The approval was described by the British foreign
  secretary, David Lammy, as a “flagrant breach” of international law. Netanyahu
  appears to have bent to the demands of far-right minority parties in his
  fragile coalition who have called for the conquest of Gaza and threatened to
  collapse the government in the event of a ceasefire deal. The Israeli military
  bombarded Gaza City overnight, a day after the call-up of 60,000 reservists
  was announced. A military official said most reservists would not serve in
  combat, giving strength to the argument that at least some of Israel’s recent
  statements amount to posturing against the background of complex ceasefire
  talks. In one attack, Israel struck an area of Deir al-Balah as a nearby
  street was crowded with civilians. Calling up the reservists is likely to take
  weeks, giving mediators time to try to bridge gaps over the ceasefire
  proposal, to which the Israeli government has yet to officially respond. The
  proposal, which aligns with an outline drawn up by Donald Trump’s special
  envoy Steve Witkoff, calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living
  hostages being held by Hamas militants and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would
  release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners. Israel had signalled
  weeks ago that it accepted that outline for a deal, with the distance between
  Hamas and Israel’s negotiators only closing since.
