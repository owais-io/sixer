  tax?

  Good morning. Britain’s fiscal outlook is bleak. The chancellor, Rachel
  Reeves, faces the daunting task of closing a £40bn black hole in the public
  finances. There is intense speculation over how she intends to, as runs that
  oft-used phrase, balance the books. This week, my colleagues have reported
  that the chancellor is considering a new “proportional” property tax. It would
  mark a radical overhaul of stamp duty and council tax. While there has been a
  good deal of focus on stamp duty, changes to council tax in England have the
  potential to be the most transformative – and explosive. Almost all political
  parties agree that the council tax system – which replaced the deeply
  unpopular poll tax in 1991 and has remained unchanged since – is unfair and
  must be reformed. But just how to do so is notoriously complex and politically
  tricky – especially when so many local councils are strapped for cash. To
  better understand how England’s council tax system exacerbates inequalities
  and why it has proven so difficult to change, I spoke with Richard Partington,
  the Guardian’s senior economics correspondent. That’s after the headlines.
  Five big stories Ukraine | Donald Trump ruled out the deployment of American
  troops in Ukraine in his first interview after yesterday’s White House meeting
  with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and European leaders. UK
  news | Keir Starmer’s asylum plans have been plunged into turmoil after a high
  court ruling blocked people seeking refuge from being housed in an Essex
  hotel. Gaza | Israel has said it will deliver its response to international
  mediators by Friday over a new Gaza ceasefire plan accepted by Hamas amid
  mounting pressure for a truce. UK politics | A Reform UK-led county council
  has served its residents a “plate of chaos” from the start of its leadership,
  according to its Conservative opposition. Work | Older employees who are
  disturbed by younger, more boisterous colleagues in the workplace are not
  victims of age harassment, an employment tribunal has ruled. In depth: I
  predict a riot When you move into a new home, one of the first letters that
  comes through your letterbox is the amount of council tax you owe to the local
  authority. This local form of taxation is paid by every household living in
  the area, whether renting or owning. The funds are used to pay for services
  from rubbish collection to meals on wheels. It is a tax that people can see
  and feel in their daily lives. Just how council tax came to be goes some way
  to explain why there has been such a reluctance to try to change it. Before
  council tax, a system called rates used to fund local councils. In the 1980s,
  Margret Thatcher’s Conservative government tried to introduce a flat tax,
  payable no matter the value of the property you lived in, or the income you
  were on. This became widely known as the poll tax. “It was controversial. The
  poll tax was first introduced in Scotland as a sort of pilot scheme and there
  was a big uproar. When it was coming to England in the late 1980s, there were
  huge riots, which coincided with the massive unpopularity of the tail end of
  the Thatcher administration,” Richard Partington tells me. “It was one of the
  factors that brought down her premiership. And to replace it, they went back
  to this compromised, fudged system between the old rates system and the poll
  tax, and it was called council tax.” The system was devised in 1991 and came
  into effect in 1993. The problem, however, is that the amount someone pays in
  council tax is still based on what property prices were in 1991. Which would
  work, if only we hadn’t built any homes since then and prices had never
  changed. “There’s something like 4.5m new homes or more that have been built
  since 1991, and then countless more conversions of factory buildings, of
  barns, and other non-residential properties, like shops, to homes. And you’ve
  got this army of experts trying to guess how much it would have been worth in
  1991,” Richard says. It’s not just those on the left who think the system, as
  it stands, is absurd. Richard points to criticism by David Willetts, the chair
  of the Resolution Foundation, who was advising on tax policy in Margaret
  Thatcher’s policy unit in the 1980s. “He actually thinks that council tax has
  become as regressive as the poll tax.” *** Fundamentally unfair system It is
  worth spelling out just how ridiculous the council tax system is. Several
  taxation bands dictate how much a household will have to pay to a local
  authority. But a resident in Blackpool living in a band B property, where the
  average house price is £130,000, will pay £1,860; while in Kensington and
  Chelsea, where the average house is worth £2.2m, the same band B bill would be
  £1,220. “It hasn’t taken account of the huge booming property valuations that
  have taken place over the past 30-odd years. And that means that you’ve got
  people living in hugely expensive homes that are paying relatively low rates
  of council tax. And that is sort of fundamentally unfair,” Richard says. Of
  course, the question of how to fix a situation where the numbers are so out of
  touch with reality brings its own problems – but we’ll get to that later. ***
  A worsening funding crisis Council tax is not the only way local authorities
  get money. They also receive grants from central government. But due to
  austerity measures under Conservative governments, spending power funded by
  these grants fell in real terms by more than 50% between 2010 and 2021. This
  is coupled with local councils’ ballooning budgets trying to cater to the
  growing needs of the population. Councils are in charge of a lot more than
  just littering and local libraries; for example, they front the costs for
  social care for vulnerable adults and children. “A large part of what councils
  do, most people won’t see on a day-to-day basis. But adult and children’s
  social care service spending has increased so much because we’ve got an older
  and increasingly unwell population, and the cost of delivery has increased. To
  pay for that, there have been cuts to other areas of spending like road
  cleaning and libraries,” Richard says. Several councils have declared
  bankruptcy as a result in recent years and they won’t be alone in feeling the
  pinch. Almost half of councils in England risk falling into bankruptcy without
  action to address a £4.6bn deficit amassed under Conservative-era policies,
  according to the government’s spending watchdog. “Most people who wouldn’t
  come into contact with adult social or children’s services think that they’re
  paying more to their local authority and not getting much for it. They don’t
  understand why and that’s a huge issue.” *** Winners and losers The problem
  with the council tax system is that the longer we wait, the harder it becomes
  to fix, Richard says. With the local council funding crisis coming to a head,
  the Labour government cannot choose to look away like its predecessors. But
  the solutions floated come with their own headaches. The deputy prime
  minister, Angela Rayner, is spearheading the “fair funding review”, to figure
  out a new way of distributing central government grant funding to councils.
  That is due to come in from April next year and is under consultation. “Among
  the things they’re looking at is rebalancing the amount of funding for
  councils in more deprived areas so that they receive more money in central
  government funding than wealthier areas. Largely that is going to help
  councils in the north of England and the Midlands, where they have
  historically been underfunded by central government grants. And the losers
  will be in London and the south and the home counties,” Richard says. But a
  study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies shows that some of the biggest
  losers will be inner London boroughs where property valuations might be high
  but there are pockets of deep deprivation and child poverty. “It highlights
  that while reforming the system that is so broken, there are going to be all
  kinds of issues that pop up in the process. You might think that you’re
  addressing one problem, but another one will arise as a consequence,” Richard
  says. *** More fundamental reforms Reeves is reportedly considering
  overhauling stamp duty and council tax in a bid to raise desperately needed
  revenue. This was an idea put forward last year by Dr Tim Leunig, who was a
  government adviser in Rishi Sunak’s Treasury, in a report for the centre-right
  thinktank Onwards. “His idea was to replace council tax and stamp duty in one
  go with a proportional property tax that would take more accurate account of
  current property valuations on a national level, and a local version that
  would fund local services that would over time replace council tax,” Richard
  explains. The reporting suggests any changes to council tax will probably not
  take place until Labour wins a second term. Is this Labour kicking the can
  down the line? Richard doesn’t think so. “It’s a slow process because there
  are all these issues to consider. One of the problems is that the scale of the
  house price changes since the 90s means that if you were to institute a
  council tax that was actually reflective of current property values, you’d
  probably crash the London property market and lots of other places where house
  prices have boomed since the 90s,” Richard says. He adds that there are many
  people across the country who might live in what are now hugely valuable
  properties, but it doesn’t mean they bought them for those prices. And,
  perhaps most importantly, it doesn’t mean they have high incomes to pay for a
  regular council tax charge that reflects the modern-day value of the home.
  “People hate council tax, and the idea that your council tax would
  significantly rise would be politically toxic for Labour,” Richard says. “So
  they’ve been very careful with it.” What else we’ve been reading A vivid and

  Dozens of cameras have been set up along the route to enable people across
  Sweden and the world to watch as part of the latest “slow TV” extravaganza
  billed as “Den stora kyrkflytten” (the big church move). More than 10,000
  people, including the Swedish king, Carl XVI Gustaf, are expected to line the
  streets – which have been widened especially. The endeavour took eight years
  of planning, and the church is not expected to reopen at its new location at
  the end of next year. The whole town is being moved to make way for the
