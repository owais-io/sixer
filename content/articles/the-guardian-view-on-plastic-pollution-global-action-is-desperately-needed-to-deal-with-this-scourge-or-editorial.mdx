  The Guardian view on plastic pollution: global action is desperately needed to
  deal with this scourge | Editorial

  Plastic pollution has reached the most remote and inaccessible parts of our
  beleaguered planet. It has been found in Greenland’s ice cap, near the summit
  of Mount Everest, and in the deepest depths of the western Pacific Ocean.
  Nature programmes have sounded the alarm over a human-made crisis that has
  become an environmental scourge and a serious threat to our health. Yet global
  production of plastics is on course to triple to more than a billion tonnes a
  year by 2060, after increasing by more than 200 times over the past 75 years.
  This gloomy backdrop should inject a sense of urgency into UN-convened talks
  in Switzerland this week, aimed at agreeing a binding global plastics treaty.
  In 2022, when 173 countries committed to work towards such an accord, there
  was widespread relief that at last a multilateral route was to be taken
  towards solving a quintessentially global problem. Sadly, as delegates gather
  in Geneva, there are reasons to be fearful. As major oil-producing countries
  seek to circumvent the consequences of the green transition, the fossil
  fuel-based manufacture of plastics has become a key battleground. During five
  rounds of negotiations, over three years, a “petrochemical bloc” led by Russia
  and Saudi Arabia has stalled and obstructed attempts to agree a reduction in
  production. And as a recent investigation by the Guardian laid bare, corporate
  capture of the talks has also become a significant problem. Industry lobbyists
  have sought to dominate and divert the debate, promoting implausible panaceas
  in the form of new recycling technologies and other mitigating measures. The
  return of Donald Trump to the White House is unlikely to improve the prospects
  of a truly ambitious reset. On the first day of his second term Mr Trump
  withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement, signalling his
  contempt for multilateralism and his unflinching backing for big oil. There
  are already signs that in Geneva the US plans to align itself with fellow
  fossil-fuel producers in resisting any attempt to agree to a reduction in
  virgin plastic production. Given such headwinds, the scale of the crisis bears
  reiteration. Ahead of this week’s talks, an expert review published in the
  Lancet described plastics as “a grave, growing and under-recognised danger to
  human and planetary health”. Thanks to television series such as Blue Planet
  II, the grievous impact on blighted marine ecosystems is relatively widely
  understood. But plastic production also contributes more than 3% of annual
  global greenhouse emissions. Most insidiously, its ubiquitous presence in
  everyday life means that chemical additives and pollutants find their way into
  human bodies. According to the Lancet report, health-related damages globally
  add up to £1.1tn a year, with infants and children particularly vulnerable.
  Carrying on with business as usual, while seeking unlikely technological
  fixes, will not be good enough. A cap on global production is desperately
  needed, though achieving that in Geneva looks like a tall order. At last
  November’s talks in South Korea, more than 100 countries supported legally
  binding reductions but negotiations collapsed without an agreement. A
  consensus of sorts may be found on the need to eliminate harmful chemicals
  from future manufacture, and phasing out single-use plastics, which account
  for half of the 400m tonnes produced every year. That would at least be a
  start. After years of obfuscation and delay, something tangible must emerge
  from Switzerland. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
