  Ademola Lookman has gone on strike as he attempts to force through a move to
  Inter, but Atalanta have insisted he will not be sold to another Italian club.
  The Nigeria forward did not attend pre-season training for the second day in a
  row after handing in a transfer request last weekend, when Lookman also
  published a statement in which he accused Atalanta of “broken promises”. An
  improved Inter bid worth up to €45m (£32.1m) including add-ons was rejected
  last week after a €40m offer for the 27-year-old was turned down. Inter are
  expected to return with a bid that matches Atalanta’s €50m valuation after
  Lookman again failed to attend a scheduled individual training session at his
  club’s training ground in Zingonia on Tuesday. “Despite now receiving an offer
  in alignment to what I believe had been discussed, sadly the club are blocking
  the opportunity for reasons I do not understand,” Lookman wrote on Instagram
  on Sunday. “As a result and after many months of broken promises and what I
  feel has been poor treatment towards me as both a human being and as a
  professional footballer, sadly I feel I have no choice but to speak out for
  what I believe is right and I feel that enough is enough.” The Atalanta chief
  executive, Luca Percassi, has confirmed the club have an agreement to allow
  Lookman to leave this summer but he said that was only for a “top” club
  outside Serie A. “The pact with Lookman was made a year ago, when we refused a
  €20m offer from PSG,” he said. “The club is always careful when evaluating the
  value and timing of its players, but as always, it is Atalanta, the club, that
  decides.” Napoli and Atlético Madrid are also believed to be interested in
  Lookman, who came through Charlton’s academy and has also played for Everton,
  Fulham and Leicester in England. He joined Atalanta from RB Leipzig in 2022.
  The reigning African player of the year helped them to win the Europa League
  last year and scored 15 times in Serie A last season.
