  blended and bourbon

  Whisky – or whiskey if we’re talking about the Irish or American stuff –
  continues to enjoy widespread appeal. Whether you’re picking up a bottle for
  your scotch-loving relative’s birthday, restocking the home bar or looking for
  a couple of new nightcaps, the choice can be pretty overwhelming. While scotch
  is arguably the most famous type of whisky, there’s quality and interest to be
  found far and wide, with premium distilleries doing exciting things in places
  such as India, Japan, the Nordic countries and beyond. The beauty of
  whisky-making is that so much expression comes from the landscape where the
  grain and water are sourced, together with the skill and preferences of the
  blender; so each whisky’s profile offers something different to be explored.
  From smoothly sweet Speyside whiskies to the harmonious balance of the
  Japanese blends, all the way up to the seriously spendy aged single malts,
  tasting and trying is the only way to discover which whisky tickles your fancy
  beyond these loose geographic profile styles. But, after carefully testing
  every whisky on this list against many more, I’m satisfied there is something
  here to please every palate. Spicy rye just asking to be made into a
  manhattan, silky bourbons to satisfy your inner Don Draper and a surprising
  English entry I can’t get enough of; these are my top whisky picks to buy
  right now. I tasted each one neat – to get a clear comparison across the
  board, you understand – before mixing up any cocktails that the style
  particularly inspired, and I suggest you do the same. The fun’s all in the
  trying. *** The best whisky in 2025 *** Best aged single malt Glenmorangie
  18-year-old the Infinita, 70cl £123.95 at Master Of Malt £123.88 at Amazon
  It’s easy to spend silly money on aged single malts, but this (almost)
  accessibly priced 18-year-old Glenmorangie is a safe bet for scotch fans. Its
  honeyed spice notes morph into burnt orange, jasmine and wood smoke for a
  deeply delicious dram for any whisky connoisseur. This tasted fantastic
  rounding off a special dinner as a celebratory digestif. *** Best sustainable
  whisky Nc’nean organic single malt, 70cl £51.75 at the Whisky Exchange £55 at
  Master of Malt Made from organic barley on the wild west coast of Scotland,
  Nc’nean is single malt scotch – but not as you know it. Female-founded, B
  Corp-certified and the first UK whisky distillery to achieve net zero
  emissions, it tastes good and does good. It’s also a Great Taste Award winner.
  It’s fresh and lively with lemon and opens up to candied citrus sweets with a
  dash of tropicality. I found it divine in a highball with a sprig of fresh
  mint. *** Best unusual whisky Rampur double cask single malt whisky, 70cl £56
  at Majestic £59.99 at Amazon India may not be the first place you think of for
  whisky – but think of India you should. Rampur Distillery has been distilling
  for almost a century using Himalayan groundwater to add a uniquely Indian
  flavour. Extreme weather means the casked whisky matures rapidly, leading to
  deeper levels of flavour and complexity. Think heady cinnamon spice, salted
  caramel and all things nice in this must-try bottle. *** Best aged blended
  whisky GlenAllachie White Heather 15-year-old, 70cl £57.50 at Master of Malt
  £57.50 at the Whisky Exchange White heather is a rare variant of the
  ubiquitous purple flower with rich symbolism in Scottish folklore; stumbling
  across a patch is said to bring luck, and brides often include a sprig in
  their bouquet. Lucky you to be trying this wonderful blend from GlenAllachie’s
  master distiller, I say. Single malts from across Scotland combine to create a
  heather-honeyed balance of oranges, mocha and a faint wisp of smoke – I found
  it dangerously drinkable. *** Best peated whisky Tobermory Ledaig 10-year
  single malt scotch, 70cl £40.75 at the Whiskey Exchange £38.95 at Amazon
  Hailing from the Inner Hebridean Isle of Mull, this is a more approachable
  peated whisky than the famed neighbouring Islay styles. More freshness and
  minerality make for a more measured sip, yet it still retains that
  unmistakable smoky island character. Soft peat mingles with a medicinal nose
  that’s happily more peppery and vanilla-based on the palate, though the
  background of smoke persists. At this price, you can afford to try it even if
  you think island whiskies aren’t for you; you may just surprise yourself. ***
  Best Japanese whisky The Matsui sakura cask whisky, 70cl £165 at Selfridges
  £134.91 at Amazon The Kurayoshi Distillery has been producing spirits since
  1910, using fresh volcanic water from nearby Mount Daisen’s snowmelt. This
  single malt’s pale hue offers no hint of the richness within, which boasts a
  floral, spicy nose and bold bakery flavours, with pepper on the palate. The
  floweriness on the finish is a fitting nod to the Japanese cherry blossom
  sakura casks used to age the whisky. I found this opened up nicely with a drop
  of water. *** Best small-batch whisky Holyrood Distillery Ambir single malt,
  70cl £58.25 at the Whisky Exchange £63.95 at Royal Mile Whiskies Fresh from
  winning gold in the small-batch category at the World Whiskies Awards, Ambir
  is the third iteration of single malts from newcomer Holyrood Distillery.
  Using four speciality malts chosen for their dessert-style textures and
  flavours, Ambir is perfect for enjoying as an after-dinner drink. The tempting
  tastes of Scottish tablet, buttery fudge and jammy cornflake tart abound, with
  a subtle leathery savouriness taking it back from the brink of being too
  simplistic. Enjoy with – or as – pudding. *** Best experimental whisky Noble
  Rebel Hazelnut Harmony, 70cl £37 at Master of Malt £39.95 at the Whisky
  Exchange Go nuts for this boldly experimental blended whisky from Loch Lomond
  Distillery, where toasted hazelnuts, almonds and oak are expertly layered with
  indulgent vanilla and honeycomb flavours and more than a touch of pear
  crumble. Using fine single malts from across the country, this is a
  mouthwatering marriage of grains if you like your whiskies sweet, sticky and
  smoke-free. *** Best bourbon Woodford Reserve Kentucky bourbon, 70cl £37.50 at
  Morrisons £39 at the Whisky Shop This universally popular super-smooth bourbon
  is as good as a gift as it is for drinking yourself. Kentucky’s favourite
  straight, Woodford Reserve is harmoniously balanced, with warming aromas,
  dried fruit and a creamy finish. Best enjoyed neat – although it’s also my
  go-to for a Don Draper-worthy old fashioned. *** Best Speyside whisky
  Benromach Contrasts Organic Speyside single malt, 70cl £51.75 at the Whisky
  Exchange £51.75 at Master of Malt This is the whisky that first made me fall
  in love with whisky. Impossibly smooth, with unexpected but harmonious
  flavours of banana split, a hit of pepper and tons of malt, Benromach
  Contrasts Organic is typically Speyside in terms of its sweetness and light,
  but with a cocoa richness, aged maturity and interest that its price tag
  suggests. It’s also the world’s first Soil Association-accredited organic
  scotch. Drinks like a dream in a hip flask on a cold country walk. *** Best
  Islay whisky selection Smokehead whisky skull gift tin, 3 x 5cl £24.95 at
  Royal Mile Whiskies £18.45 at Amazon Fans of Islay scotch will enjoy making
  their way through this Smokehead selection flight. There are three single
  malts laden with seaweed, fiery peat and sweetness to be explored: original;
  High Voltage 58%; and Rum Rebel, which is matured in Caribbean rum casks for a
  tropical explosion alongside the signature sea spray and smoke. *** Best
  whisky gift set Isle of Raasay scotch gift set, 70cl £69.99 at Selfridges The
  rugged Hebridean island of Raasay (population 194) is home to Raasay
  Distillery, which produces this lightly peated single malt. Matured in rye,
  oak and bordeaux casks, this is a complex drop with flavours of wild dark
  fruit, toffee, spice and smoke. Take this smartly boxed set next time you need
  a dinner party gift for a whisky-drinking host: two beautiful Glencairn
  tasting glasses are included alongside the decanter-style bottle for sharing.
  *** Best sherry-led whisky The Lakes Whiskymaker’s Reserve No 7, 70cl £83.75
  at the Whisky Exchange £84.50 at Amazon The Lakes Distillery has quickly made
  a name for itself in new world whisky, and with expressions like this one, I
  can see why. The Whiskymaker’s Reserve No 7 is a single malt made in the image
  of whiskies like Dalmore; sherry-led, matured in oloroso and pedro ximénez
  casks, plus a few red wine casks thrown in for good measure. The result is
  richly fruited with warming spices and layers of woodiness, complex, clever
  and evocative of long Lake District walks. While it’s not the most affordable
  whisky on this list, you won’t regret putting your hand in your pocket for a
  little treat this tempting. *** Joanne Gould is a food, drink and lifestyle
  writer with a decade of experience. As well as enthusiastically eating her way
  through London’s best bars and restaurants, she’s also a keen home cook and
  can often be found trying a new recipe or kitchen gadget, while taste-testing
  anything from South African wines to speciality coffee or scotch. Luckily, she
  also enjoys walking, running and keeping fit and healthy in her spare time –
