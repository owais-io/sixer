  We were making The Company of Wolves. And we had a problem. With Angela
  Carter, I had written a scene where the devil drives a cream-coloured
  Rolls-Royce through an imaginary forest, chauffeured by the young dreamer
  Rosaleen, played by Sarah Patterson. My initial thought was for Andy Warhol to
  play the devil. Those pale-blue eyes and that blank expression framed by the
  blond wig. Andy read the script and liked it. Stephen Woolley, the producer,
  flew to New York to talk to him, but he was recovering from being shot by
  Valerie Solanas, who seemed to think he was the actual devil. He said he would
  play the part, if we shot his scenes in New York. Which gave us the problem.
  Susie Figgis, the casting director, suggested Terence Stamp. I remembered him
  from Superman, The Collector, Far from the Madding Crowd, but most of all from
  Pasolini’s Theorem. He lived in the Albany, a strange oasis of quiet just off
  Piccadilly, in the bustling centre of London. As I entered its weird
  Ruritanian portico it struck me that it would be a perfect residence for the
  devil, if he ever chose to exist. I met Terence, saw those eyes that were even
  bluer than Warhol’s and realised that the devil, if he did exist, would be
  just such a gentleman. A gimlet jaw, just a hint of a smile and that
  dangerous, indefinable quality, absolute charm. The “Ruritanian forest” we
  constructed was designed by Anton Furst. There were trees with bark like the
  musculature of flayed animals. There was an enormous split oak, the roots of
  which mimicked a high-heeled shoe. Terence was driven through it in a pale
  Rolls-Royce, by Sarah Patterson in a platinum blonde wig, dressed in a
  cream-coloured chauffeur’s suit. He held the shrivelled skull of a long dead
  infant in his hand. He handed a small phial of ointment to a young man, who,
  for some odd reason, wanted to turn into a wolf. It all made perfect sense and
  was shot in one unforgettable hour and I believe he did it for the tailored
  suit he wore. A truly angelic devil.
