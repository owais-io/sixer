  Less than a month into its existence, Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana’s new
  leftwing party is already widely seen as a mess. Its leadership, its launch
  schedule and even its name: all have caused inconclusive, semi-public rows.
  The opportunity provided by political novelty appears to be being wasted. For
  the many journalists and politicians who always see the left as incompetent
  and naive, the stop-start, seemingly uncoordinated first weeks of Your Party,
  as it may or may not eventually be named, have felt like a gift – a summer
  silly season story after months of grim political acrimony. “Thank Christ
  Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana are here to give us a laugh,” wrote Sebastian
  Murphy in the Daily Express. “Labour’s loopy Left have bravely broken free of
  Starmer’s stultification to bring us a political party that is easily the
  funniest thing since the anti-Brexit centrists Change UK.” Now largely
  forgotten, Change UK lasted 10 months after splitting from Labour in 2019. For
  left-leaning Britons who’ve had enough of Labour’s rightward shifts and
  intolerance of dissent, and have been hoping for a viable alternative, the new
  party’s launch has been depressing. Why, in times which so obviously require a
  radical fightback, can’t the left agree a clear way forward? Why is it still
  so dependent on Corbyn, who after 42 years in parliament can hardly be
  presented as a fresh figure? And where are the nimble strategists that the
  immensely difficult task of establishing a successful leftwing party is going
  to need? Some of the answers to these questions, which British leftists often
  ask each other with despairing shrugs and eye-rolls, lie in socialism’s
  struggles in this country since the 1980s. These have left the movement with
  gaps and imbalances, which are exposed whenever it tries to take the
  initiative. Yet as well as considering these weaknesses, it’s also important
  to acknowledge that, despite all the confusion and ridicule, Corbyn and
  Sultana’s new party has struck a nerve. It says that more than 600,000 people
  have signed up on its rudimentary website for updates and information about
  how to get involved – almost as many people as the memberships of Labour, the
  Tories and Reform UK combined. In some of the most hostile coverage of the new
  party, there is a revealing note of alarm. “Something has actually gone
  seriously wrong with British society,” wrote Camilla Tominey in the Telegraph,
  “if a party such as this could poll at 18 per cent” – the proportion who told
  YouGov they would “consider” voting for a new Corbyn-led party. “It’s a
  rebellion against the broken status quo.” Superficially, this rebellion seems
  little different from the half dozen that have tried and failed to break
  Labour’s left-of-centre monopoly over the past 30 years: Respect, Left Unity,
  the Workers party of Britain, the Socialist party, the Socialist Labour party,
  the London Socialist Alliance. Well-known leftists such as Arthur Scargill and
  George Galloway attempted to turn strong local power bases, personal charisma
  and leftwing credibility into something bigger, at times when Labour was
  alienating its more radical supporters. A few parliamentary and council seats
  were won, but rarely for long. The new parties were both too narrow –
  dominated by one person – and too broad – prone to ideological differences –
  to sustain their initial momentum. With their ageing figureheads and
  traditional leftwing sectarianism, the new parties did not seem new enough.
  This time, the involvement of Sultana, one of the most digitally fluent young
  MPs, sends a different signal. So does the involvement of innovative and
  ambitious political operators, such as Momentum co-founder James Schneider,
  who helped make Corbyn’s Labour leadership, at times, surprisingly dynamic and
  popular– despite it being widely written off, as the new party is now. Six
  years on from Corbynism’s defeat, there is finally a movement, largely
  undetected by the mainstream media, of bright, youngish leftwing activists
  back into the political game. And yet, as the frictions between Corbyn and
  Sultana have shown, it remains tricky to unite two leftwing generations, very
  different in age and levels of political patience – while also appealing more
  effectively to middle-aged Britons, who grew up under New Labour and often
  absorbed its centrist assumptions. These difficulties afflicted Corbyn’s
  Labour leadership, and ultimately helped destroy it. The British left has so
  often been excluded from power over the past 40 years that it frequently lacks
  the skills that experience of power can bring: building and sustaining
  coalitions, maintaining message discipline, creating political organisations
  that are representative without being too fractious. Truly leftwing British
  parties, in short, tend to be a bit rickety, yet they must stand up against
  our conservative political culture’s strongest winds. Then again, such
  deficiencies may matter less nowadays. The deep discontent and many crises
  left by 14 years of rightwing rule, impatience with Starmer’s methodical but
  patchy reforms, and outrage at his government’s Gaza evasions, mean that many
  voters are in an adventurous – or reckless – mood. A radical party with a
  highly divisive leader, thrown-together structure and frequent internal rows
  already exists, and it’s called Reform. Its poll lead suggests that voters are
  less interested than journalists in party processes, and more interested in
  stories about what’s wrong with Britain, compellingly told. Whether at rallies
  or on social media, Sultana and Corbyn are just as capable of this as Nigel
  Farage. A new poll shows that Reform voters strongly prefer Corbyn to Starmer,
  which suggests that the new party could take Reform votes. Reform has more
  media backing than the new party ever will. Yet it’s likely that rightwing
  journalists will keep giving the leftwing party publicity, and even some
  favourable coverage, in order to hurt Labour. So the new party will need to
  pull off a balancing act: keeping its personalities and factions happy,
  developing populist but not fantastical policies, and wounding the government
  without helping Farage into Downing Street. Labour loyalists will say that a
  left divided is a left defeated. But if they truly believed that, Starmer’s
  party and government would be much more pluralist. What these loyalists really
  think is that the left should only ever be divided on their terms. That
  entitled and coercive logic has now had consequences. A new leftwing party,
  risky and imperfect, could be here to stay. This time, it’s possible that our
  politics will never be quite the same again. Andy Beckett is a Guardian
