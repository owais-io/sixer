  The actor and DJ Kristian Nairn has withdrawn from the new series of Strictly
  Come Dancing for medical reasons, the BBC has announced. Nairn, 49, was
  initially named among the 15 celebrities taking part in this year’s show. The
  BBC said another contestant would be drafted in to replace him. “With a heavy
  heart, I have to step back from this season of Strictly Come Dancing due to
  unexpected medical reasons,” Nairn said. “I was truly looking forward to the
  journey, and I’m deeply sorry to disappoint anyone who was looking forward to
  seeing me on the dancefloor. Thank you all for your support, and I will be
  back on my feet very soon, in every sense.” The actor became known for playing
  the laconic Hodor in the long-running TV series Game of Thrones. Asked at the
  height of the show’s fame if he ever got sick of being asked to repeat “Hodor”
  – the single line he delivered over and over – he said: “This is what I always
  tell people and it’s 100% true: 10 times more people ask me if I’m sick of
  being asked to say Hodor than actually ask me to say Hodor. It’s really weird,
  like a paradox.” In 2015, while still appearing on Game of Thrones, he
  released his debut single, a house track named Up (Club Mix) featuring Leanne
  Robinson, and embarked on a three-month tour across the US and UK. On
  Thursday, Strictly’s executive producer at BBC Studios, Sarah James, said:
  “We’ve absolutely loved getting to know Kristian in this short time, and he
  has all the makings of a brilliant Strictly Come Dancing contestant. We’re
  incredibly sorry to lose him from this year’s series and we all wish him a
  speedy recovery.” The new celebrity joining Strictly would be announced on the
  One Show on Thursday, the broadcaster said.
