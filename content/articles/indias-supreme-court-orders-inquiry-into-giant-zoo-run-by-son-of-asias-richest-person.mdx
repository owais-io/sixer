  India’s supreme court has ordered an investigation into a vast private zoo
  founded by the son of Asia’s richest person over allegations of illegal
  wildlife imports and financial misconduct. Home to a reported 200 lions, 250
  leopards and 900 crocodiles, Vantara in western Gujarat state describes itself
  as the “world’s biggest wild animal rescue centre”. It is run by Anant Ambani,
  a son of Mukesh Ambani, the billionaire head of the conglomerate Reliance
  Industries, and was one of the venues for his extravagant wedding celebrations
  last year, where celebrities were encouraged to wear “jungle fever” outfits.
  Despite a visit from Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, who praised the
  operation as “truly commendable”, the 3,000-acre site is not open to the
  public and has faced intense criticism from wildlife activists over how more
  than 150,000 animals at the site area are treated. The facility, which Vantara
  says is intended to provided “lifelong care for animals that cannot be
  reintroduced into the wild”, is situated on baking flatlands next to a giant
  oil refinery complex owned by the Ambani family. In March, a joint
  investigation by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Venezuelan investigative media
  outlet Armando Info found at least 39,000 wild animals had been delivered to
  the facility. On Monday, India’s supreme court said it had ordered a panel led
  by retired judges to investigate alleged unlawful acquisition of animals,
  particularly elephants, other violations of wildlife regulations and money
  laundering. They must submit their report by 12 September. “We consider it
  appropriate … to call for an independent factual appraisal,” the court said.
  It added that the team would also assess whether Gujarat’s harsh climate was
  unsuitable for the animals, and “complaints regarding creation of a vanity or
  private collection”. The court said it issued the order after petitions based
  on media reports and complaints by wildlife organisations. Vantara said in a
  statement on Tuesday that it would extend “full cooperation” to the
  investigation team and “remains committed to transparency, compassion and full
  compliance with the law”. “Our mission and focus continues to be the rescue,
  rehabilitation and care of animals,” it said. Over the last year, Vantara has
  featured heavily on the YouTube channel of the US wildlife influencer Forrest
  Galante, showcasing facilities such as an elephant jacuzzi and the world’s
  largest leopard rescue centre. But the investigation by Süddeutsche Zeitung
  and Armando Info, which looked at import data for thousands of wildlife,
  raised concerns about the origins of some of the animals. They reported that a
  mountain gorilla – which typically lives in a family group – and 14 orangutans
  were among more than 11,000 animals moved to the facilities from the United
  Arab Emirates (UAE). More than 100 giant otters and 142 giant anteaters were
  brought from Venezuela, while 481 green tree pythons and 520 hawk doves were
  brought in from Malaysia and Indonesia respectively, according to the report.
  Vantara did not respond to their reporting. The zoo was among the many venues
  for Anant Ambani’s lavish multi-day wedding celebrations in 2024, which set a
  new benchmark in matrimonial extravagance with private performances by the pop
  stars Rihanna, Justin Bieber and Katy Perry. Vantara is thought to be unique
  in its size and ambition, dwarfing other private animal collections. The Wilds
  in Ohio is larger, covering more than 10,000 acres on a former coalmine, but
  has far fewer animals. Mukesh Ambani, Anant’s father, is worth $100bn, putting
  him in the world’s top 20 richest people. He made much of his money in
  petrochemicals and is also the owner of the toy shop chain Hamleys.
