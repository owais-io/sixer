  Australia’s peak Jewish group has lambasted Benjamin Netanyahu’s attack on
  Anthony Albanese as “inflammatory and provocative”, adding that the “clumsy
  intervention” showed a “woeful lack of understanding of social and political
  conditions in Australia” – notwithstanding what the group describes as
  “unseemly” conduct from Australia’s leader. The concerned intervention by the
  Executive Council of Australian Jewry (ECAJ) came as Australia and Israel
  entered the third day of a diplomatic tit-for-tat prompted by Australia’s visa
  cancellation of far-right Israeli politician Simcha Rothman on Monday. ECAJ’s
  president, Daniel Aghion, sent separate letters to both leaders on Wednesday
  afternoon. In the letter to Australia’s prime minister, he criticised
  Albanese’s previous comments accusing Netanyahu of being “in denial” as
  “excessive and gratuitously insulting”. He echoed this criticism in his letter
  to Israel’s prime minister, saying it was “unseemly for an Australian Prime
  Minister to depart from diplomatic norms”. But he also dressed down Netanyahu
  for labelling Albanese “a weak politician who betrayed Israel and abandoned
  Australia’s Jews”. “These comments have played straight into the hands of
  opponents of Israel and antisemites, to the detriment of the Australian Jewish
  community,” Aghion wrote. “Had we been consulted, we would have warned against
  such a clumsy intervention into Australia’s domestic politics. The charge of
  antisemitism, whether made directly or indirectly, is a serious one and never
  to be made lightly. “Doing so only invites scepticism, and undermines the
  efforts we and the government have been making to combat this pernicious
  phenomenon.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Alex Ryvchin, ECAJ’s co-chief
  executive, also expressed reservations about the wording of Netanyahu’s
  attack. “We’ve never used that sort of language, and if we believed it, we
  would have said it along the way,” he said on Wednesday. “We’ve expressed
  concerns for nearly two years now about some of the government’s rhetoric and
  policies and handling of the antisemitism crisis. We’ve had serious misgivings
  and we’ve made them known, but we’ve never felt abandoned. We’ve always felt
  like we can speak to government and speak to the public of this country.” He
  appealed for “both governments to remember what’s at stake to ensure that calm
  heads prevail and to conduct their matters of state privately,
  diplomatically”. In the Wednesday letters, ECAJ warned both leaders that
  Australia’s Jewish community “will not be left to deal with the fallout of a
  spat between two leaders who are playing to their respective domestic
  audiences”. “We are now calling on both [of] you … to address the policy
  differences between the two governments in the usual way through diplomacy
  rather than public posturing,” Aghion wrote. “If things need to be said
  publicly, they should be said using measured and seemly language befitting
  national leaders. Australia and Israel are mature democracies, and their
  governments need to act accordingly.” Earlier on Wednesday, when Albanese was
  asked to respond to Netanyahu’s latest criticism of him, he told reporters he
  did not “take these things personally”. “I treat leaders of other countries
  with respect. I engage with them in a diplomatic way,” he said. The home
  affairs minister, Tony Burke, had earlier accused the Israeli prime minister
  of “lashing out” against Australia over its decision to recognise a
  Palestinian state. “Strength is not measured by how many people you can blow
  up or how many children you can leave hungry,” Burke told the ABC on Wednesday
  morning. “Strength is much better measured by exactly what prime minister
  Anthony Albanese has done, which is when there’s a decision that we know
  Israel won’t like, he goes straight to Benjamin Netanyahu.” The ECAJ president
  told both Albanese and Netanyahu he had been appalled by Burke’s “incendiary
  and irresponsible” comments. Australia’s acting foreign affairs minister, Tim
  Ayres, told the ABC the government would not retaliate further with public
  statements against Netanyahu. The former science minister, Ed Husic, one of
  the more outspoken pro-Palestinian supporters within the Albanese government,
  said Australia should ramp up sanctions against Israelis over the aid and
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza. “When prime minister Netanyahu talks about
  betrayal, the betrayal is of humanitarian law, kids and innocent
  Palestinians,” he said. “And I would suggest respectfully to prime minister
  Netanyahu, the bigger focus should be to stop seeing kids being killed or
  starved.” Husic was followed by Ophir Falk, a foreign policy adviser to
  Netanyahu, who claimed to the ABC that Australia’s decision to recognise a
  Palestinian state had been “a huge reward for Hamas”. “The fact of the matter
  is that the Australian government is morally bankrupt,” Falk said. The Jewish
  Council of Australia’s spokesperson, Bart Shteinman, told Guardian Australia
  that Netanyahu’s attack on Albanese “should be a wake-up call for Australia,
  that the Israeli government is not interested in a relationship with our
  government”. He pushed for “concrete responses” from Australia, “including
  broad-based sanctions and ending the two-way arms trade”. The Zionist
  Federation of Australia’s president, Jeremy Leibler, told the Sydney Morning
  Herald that Netanyahu’s comments had been “entirely unhelpful and
  unproductive”, and praised Albanese for acting as a “statesman” and taking the
  high road. “The relationship is clearly under strain,” he said.
