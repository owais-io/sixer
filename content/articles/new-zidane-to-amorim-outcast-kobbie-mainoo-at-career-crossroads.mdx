  Remember Kobbie Mainoo? The lad from Stockport heralded as Manchester United’s
  new midfield general? A player likened at 19 to Zinedine Zidane by Paul
  Scholes and whose 2024 FA Cup final winner toppled the noisy neighbours from
  across town when he ghosted into Manchester City’s area before a silky smooth
  touch and finish past Ederson? Now, at a club of serial false dawns and zero
  title challenges since Sir Alex Ferguson retired 12 years ago, Mainoo is at a
  career crossroads. As Ruben Amorim becomes the latest manager to try to build
  United a shiny new world, Mainoo is a mere substitute. The Portuguese has no
  place for him in his 3-4-3 formation after a damning assessment that Mainoo
  lacks legs for the engine room or the pace to operate as one of the two 10s.
  Rewind to the August after Mainoo’s Cup final goal and his emergence as
  England’s star turn at the summer’s European Championship and reading Scholes’
  take on him is quasi-surreal. “He’s the nearest thing I’ve seen to Zidane in
  taking a ball, receiving the ball, cruising past people,” gushed a man
  considered the pre-eminent schemer of Ferguson’s gilded reign. “The first time
  I saw him I remember that calmness. The way he received the ball with
  confidence; I just couldn’t believe such a young player could do that.”
  Confidence and calmness seem the ideal blend for the footballer asked to
  patrol the relentless midfield traffic of the elite game where matches are
  decided. Not for Amorim. Well, not Mainoo’s version. And so, as the close of
  the market loomed, the head coach pursued Brighton’s Carlos Baleba to fill a
  hole caused by his lack of faith in Mainoo. “We have a lack of pace,
  especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and
  bring the ball,” was Amorim’s searing verdict after a tepid goalless draw with
  Leeds in Stockholm on 19 July. Mainoo, a half-time change in Sweden’s capital
  for Bruno Fernandes, again failed to convince the boss. So we saw Amorim’s
  courting of Baleba, for whom Brighton’s asking price of about £100m for a
  still raw 21-year-old has prompted United to cool their interest. On Friday
  Fabian Hürzeler signalled that the Cameroonian would not be moving. “Very,
  very, very confident,” Brighton’s head coach said of his feelings on whether
  Baleba would stay. “I didn’t see any change in him. He only changed his hair;
  that was the only change he made in the last two weeks. Overall, he seems to
  be in a really good place. He’s enjoying it with his teammates. He’s enjoying
  being a Brighton player. He’s very grateful to have the progress he made in
  the last season.” Amorim may turn to alternative options including his former
  Sporting captain Morten Hjulmand. But the strategy of his first summer window
  in charge has been questionable. To land two No 10s, a No 9, and no “pace in
  midfield” as Amorim tries to revamp United screams of lopsided thinking before
  Arsenal’s arrival for Sunday’s curtain-raiser. Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo
  are the new playmakers, and Benjamin Sesko the centre-forward. Yet how the
  centre of the Portuguese’s team fares against title-contending visitors will
  provide a barometer of how crucial the market’s closing days are for the
  Amorim-Jim Ratcliffe project. To splurge £62.5m on prising Cunha from Wolves,
  £71m on Mbeumo from Brentford and £73.7m on Sesko from RB Leipzig for a total
  £207.2m outlay but still leave the heart of the side lacking as 1 September
  nears seems portentous. Amorim, his director of football, Jason Wilcox, the
  chief executive, Omar Berrada, and their boss, Ratcliffe, may hide behind the
  horse-trading that can be chasing players’ signatures. But all rivals face the
  same wheeling-dealing challenge, and not all have the financial muscle that
  can help lure recruits with lucrative salaries as United do. More damning is
  how midfield has been a glaring issue for a relative age. Basically since last
  Christmas when Amorim decided Mainoo was not able to hustle up and down the
  pitch; an intriguing assessment for a then teenager previously etched on to
  the team sheet under Erik ten Hag and who started England’s Euro 2024 final
  defeat by Spain. Last term two separate muscle injuries ruled Mainoo out for
  83 days. The first, from 17 October to 11 November, came in the period when
  Amorim was appointed to replace Ten Hag; the second (10 February-7 April) came
  with Mainoo an established bench-warmer. Mainoo then had to watch an ageing
  and paceless Casemiro line up ahead of him in May’s 1-0 Europa League final
  defeat by Tottenham, the latest of the stark notices from Amorim that began
  when he tried rejigging Mainoo’s position over the winter. January’s 2-0
  Europa League group game win at FCSB featured him as one of the 10s (alongside
  Christian Eriksen). Mainoo scored but the following week at Crystal Palace he
  was moved to a false 9 berth. United lost 2-0 and Amorim hooked him after 70
  minutes for Rasmus Højlund. Five days later, back as a 10 for the 2-1 Cup
  victory over Leicester, he lasted 64 minutes. Next came the second injury, new
  contract talks stalling (Mainoo wants his £52,000-a-week terms upped to about
  £180,000, whereas United’s offer is nearer £100,000), the club being open to
  offers for him and only four starts after he returned to fitness for United’s
  closing 12 matches, none in Amorim’s prioritised competition, the Europa
  League. Now with Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte ahead of him for Amorim’s two
  midfield spots (plus Casemiro maybe, too), and Cunha/Mbeumo beginning as the
  preferred 10 axis, Mainoo has what may be an unwinnable fight to regain a
  berth in the XI. On Friday Amorim said of Sesko: “First of all, physically
  he’s ready. That is a big component in our league.” How Mainoo must wish the
  head coach viewed him the same.
