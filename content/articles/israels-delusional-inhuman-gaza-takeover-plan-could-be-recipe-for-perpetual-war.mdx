  One of Israel’s most celebrated images is David Rubinger’s photograph of a
  trio of paratroopers at the newly captured Western Wall in 1967, an event that
  would mark the beginning of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, East
  Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip. You see it when arriving at Tel Aviv’s Ben
  Gurion airport. It has been used to illustrate the Israel Defense Forces’
  “values” page, and appears endlessly in the Hebrew media and on pro-Israel
  sites. It is ironic that at the end of his life the central figure in the
  picture, Yitzhak Yifat, rejected at least some of the photograph’s meaning.
  Speaking to the Guardian in 2017, with the benefit of five decades of
  hindsight, he reflected on that conquest. “I can say that the results of the
  war were bad. We realised that we had conquered another people. A whole
  people. And now it seems we cannot now get to a true peace, a real peace,” he
  said. What was true then remains true today, as Israel’s security cabinet has
  authorised the full occupation once again of Gaza, beginning with Gaza City.
  While Benjamin Netanyahu has suggested it will be required until Hamas can be
  replaced, the international community should consider the strong likelihood
  that Israel will maintain an open-ended control of all of Gaza – a recipe, say
  critics, for perpetual war. And although the statement from Netanyahu’s office
  describing the decision and its aims does not include the word “occupation” –
  with all the international legal obligations that would entail – no one should
  be in any doubt that this is what is envisaged. Netanyahu’s history in
  politics and diplomacy is one of endless excuses for why Israel should never
  meet the commitments it made in the Oslo peace process towards real
  self-determination and a Palestinian state, describing endlessly over the
  years the lack of a “partner for peace” or claiming that any Palestinian state
  would be a threat to Israel. In practical terms, Israel’s decision to seize
  full control of Gaza appears as reckless as it is delusional and inhuman, not
  least the notion that Israel will maintain control until the “establishment of
  an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian
  Authority”. As it currently stands, that alternative remains a fiction of
  Netanyahu’s imagination. What will seem more plausible for many will be the
  far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich’s unpalatable parsing of the
  decision on Friday. “We are erasing the Palestinian state,” he declared,
  “first in action and then officially”. In financial terms, as Israeli media
  have pointed out, the move is likely to place another huge financial burden on
  a country that has been haemorrhaging money during more than two years of
  conflict in theatres from Lebanon to Syria, Iran, Yemen and Gaza. Speaking to
  the rightwing Israel Hayom newspaper this week, Ram Aminach, an expert in
  Israel’s military economics, suggested the cost of taking Gaza under full
  control could run to almost $6bn in the coming months, with “incomprehensible
  costs” associated with sustaining a Palestinian population of 2 million people
  in a shattered territory. “Look at the international pressure Israel faces
  today and multiply that by five, at the least,” he said. “To ease that
  pressure, we’ll need to take care of the population in Gaza. No international
  player is going to help pay for that, not while Israel is seen the way it is
  right now.” And there is an even bigger question: whether Israel has the
  resources to maintain an occupation that may be long-term. Envisaged,
  according to briefings to Israeli journalists, as involving five divisions in
  an operation lasting five to six months, it assumes that the IDF is capable of
  achieving more than it has in two and a half years of war in which it has been
  forced to launch multiple operations in areas where it has claimed Hamas was
  defeated only to see fighters return. Nor is the recent history of military
  occupations encouraging, not least the US and British experience of
  insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. That appears, at least in part, to have
  been in the mind of the IDF’s chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, when he made clear
  his opposition to the plan, suggesting it would lead to the death of the
  remaining Israeli hostages and greater risk to soldiers in an already
  exhausted Israeli military from improvised explosive devices. While Zamir has
  expressed his opposition in private to Netanyahu, others have made the same
  points publicly, among them the Israeli opposition leader, Yair Lapid, who
  described the decision as a “disaster that will lead to many more disasters”.
  Charging that Netanyahu had been dragged into the decision by his far-right
  allies who have campaigned for Jewish settlement in Gaza, he described the
  plan as “a move that will kill the hostages and many soldiers, will cost
  Israeli taxpayers tens of billions and will destroy Israel’s diplomatic
  relations”. “This is exactly what Hamas wanted: for Israel to end up stuck in
  Gaza without a goal, in a useless occupation, the point of which no one
  understands,” Lapid said. All of which leaves what will be regarded by many in
  the international community as the most glaringly problematic issue. While the
  IDF controls 75% of Gaza, the remaining 25% of territory where the new
  Netanyahu offensive will be focused is where 80% of Gaza’s population has been
  displaced to. How Israel plans to achieve its full control without a massive
  increase in civilian deaths in an already starving and desperate Palestinian
  population is chillingly undescribed. Multiple mass fatality incidents around
  the Israeli- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s food distribution
  sites – where, according to the UN and other aid organisations, Israeli
  soldiers have killed hundreds of aid seekers – suggests that the IDF should
  not be counted on to behave humanely when confronted by those civilians. Keir
  Starmer, the UK prime minister, said on Friday: “The Israeli government’s
  decision to further escalate its offensive in Gaza is wrong and we urge it to
  reconsider immediately. This action will do nothing to bring an end to this
  conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages. It will only bring
  more bloodshed.”
