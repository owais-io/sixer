  Rachel Galvo: The Shite Feminist review – swaggering comedy about religion and
  privilege at an all-girls school
sectionName: Stage
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-18T21:00:01Z'
bodyText: >-
  Rachel Galvo ditched a career in business a few years back, fleeing Dublin for
  London drama school – where she wrote what is now The Shite Feminist, her
  first standup show. As the name implies, and her intro (“Ladies, and hopefully
  not too many gentlemen …”) confirms, it’s not made with the likes of me in
  mind. But there’s still plenty to enjoy for sheepish men in the crowd, as the
  25-year-old shares not very fond memories of life at an all-girls private
  Catholic school on the other side of the Irish Sea. At least initially, it’s
  no great sob story, and not only because Galvo openly admits (and sends up)
  how pampered and privileged a childhood she had. But the religious education
  she depicts can still raise eyebrows, even if Galvo’s account of it
  (fetishising Jesus, or observing that the Bible’s only templates for
  femininity are “a virgin and a prostitute”) feels well-worn. It’s less the
  superstition that shocks you than the sexism, as Galvo, like her schoolmates,
  is prepped to become – in her words – “the highly educated stay-at-home wife
  of a rugby player”. It’s the tyranny she experiences too at the hands of girls
  better educated about menstrual health than young Rachel was – cue one
  arresting anecdote about a misapplied tampon and an uncomfortable swim in the
  Atlantic. Another highlight finds our host demonstrating the winsome giggle
  women perform for men’s benefit, so distant from the incontinent cackles
  reserved for one another. As Galvo’s teenage years unfold, we see this
  show-pony of a tween simultaneously grow up and shrink, bullied into
  submission for her weight and her weirdness. It’s no surprise then that she
  might use The Shite Feminist to settle some scores – even if the show overdoes
  the gender essentialism in its stereotype of needy, inadequate men requiring
  their women to be weak and demure. If its transition is clunky, finally, from
  the story of Galvo’s God-fearing, all-female education (its relation to
  feminism implicit at best) to her fretting about feminist principle and
  practice in the final act, this remains a show with a likable swagger. • At
  Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival
