  A man who raped and strangled his former fiancee to death at his 60th birthday
  dinner at a luxury hotel in Surrey last year has been jailed for life. James
  Cartwright, 61, was found guilty of the rape and murder of Samantha
  Mickleburgh, 54, by a jury last month. He had attacked his former partner at
  the hotel after Mickleburgh conceded to attending a birthday meetup as a
  gesture of kindness, prosecutors said. They said he then launched a “vicious
  and murderous attack” and tried to cover up the killing, telling police
  Mickleburgh had died after falling out of bed. Cartwright had maintained his
  innocence throughout the trial and pleaded not guilty to all charges. He was
  found not guilty of the charge of controlling or coercive behaviour and will
  serve a minimum 28-year sentence. During the month-long trial, the Guildford
  crown court heard how Mickleburgh, from Axminster in Devon, had been an
  “incredible mother” and successful businesswoman. She had agreed to attend the
  birthday dinner with Cartwright because she thought he had no one else to
  celebrate with. Honouring her prior commitment, she had organised a room with
  separate twin beds, and a six-course dinner at the five-star Pennyhill Park
  hotel in Bagshot. But the court heard that after the second course,
  Mickleburgh became unwell, with restaurant staff saying she struggled to stand
  when Cartwright walked her out. Upon return to their room, Cartwright raped
  and strangled her, causing a skull fracture. He called an ambulance the
  following morning, claiming he had found her dead in bed next to him. The
  court heard he had also placed an engagement ring on Mickleburgh’s finger to
  make it appear as if they had rekindled their romance, and that he had staged
  the room to make it appear as if they had engaged in consensual sex. Justice
  Murray in handing down his sentence on Friday said Mickleburgh’s family had
  described her as “caring, thoughtful, fun, well-organised, generous to a fault
  and devoted to her family”. They had suffered grief that lay “beyond words to
  fully describe”. The court had earlier heard from her family who described him
  as an “evil, controlling, manipulative predator” who thought he would get away
  with the murder. One of her sisters, Tracey Carter, spoke of an “indescribable
  amount of pain and suffering” after recalling how the family had welcomed
  Cartwright into their “homes and hearts”. “I wish she had never met you. Did
  you feel proud of yourself when you lied to my father, saying that Sam had
  died in her sleep, knowing full well the horror that you had put her through?”
  Carter said in her victim impact statement. The jury handed down a unanimous
  verdict of guilt on charges of murder and rape. Prosecutors had argued that
  his behaviour towards Mickleburgh had been “cruel, repressive and overbearing”
  and that he had a history of such behaviour in his previous relationships.
  Moses Koroma, prosecuting, said the jury had seen “straight through
  Cartwright’s claims that this had all resulted from her falling out of bed”.
