  Erin Patterson is expected to face some of her murder victims’ loved ones in a
  pre-sentencing hearing on Monday. The two-day plea hearing will mark the first
  time Patterson has attended court in person since she was found guilty of
  triple murder on 7 July. A Victorian supreme court jury convicted Patterson,
  50, of murdering Don and Gail Patterson, the parents of her estranged husband,
  Simon, and his aunt, Heather Wilkinson. The jury also found Patterson guilty
  of attempting to murder Heather’s husband, Ian Wilkinson. Patterson hosted the
  guests at a lunch in July 2023 where she deliberately fed them beef
  wellingtons laced with death cap mushrooms. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Here’s what to expect from the two-day plea hearing that begins on Monday.
  What is a plea hearing? The plea hearing is an opportunity for the prosecution
  and defence to make arguments about any mitigating or aggravating factors that
  should be considered by the judge in determining a convicted person’s
  sentence. The prosecution’s submissions will include victim impact statements
  which outline how the crime has affected the victims or their families. They
  will also make arguments about the nature of the crimes committed, including
  aggravating factors that they think supreme court judge Christopher Beale
  should take into account. Patterson’s lawyers will present information they
  believe are relevant mitigating factors, which could include presenting
  medical or psychological reports. Patterson’s plea hearing will occur in
  Melbourne rather than Morwell – where the 11-week trial was held – due to
  maintenance works at the regional court. Who will we hear from? Prosecutor
  Jane Warren flagged there would be “a lot” of victim impact statements, but
  the full list will not be made available until Monday. Appearing at a court
  hearing earlier this month, Warren told Justice Beale that one of the two days
  set aside for the plea hearing would likely be taken up entirely by victim
  impact statements. What’s next after the plea hearing? Beale will adjourn the
  hearing to consider the arguments and hand down Patterson’s sentence at a
  later date. Patterson then has 28 days after sentencing to lodge an appeal.
  She pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed the deaths were a tragic
  accident. Could the victims be compensated? Victims of crime can apply for
  financial compensation. After Patterson’s conviction, her home in the regional
  Victorian town of Leongatha, where the lethal mushroom lunch was held was
  restrained by the court. The court granted the confiscation application over
  the property on 23 July – about two weeks after the verdict. The Victorian
  Office of Public Prosecutions said the confiscation application was to prevent
  the property being sold or otherwise dealt with. A OPP spokesperson said it
  would ensure that if any family members of Patterson’s victims applied for
  compensation or restitution, the property would be available for any court
  orders. What sentence will Erin Patterson face? In Victoria, the maximum
  penalty for murder is life imprisonment without parole. The standard sentence
  is 25 years’ imprisonment, according to a guide for judicial officers produced
  by the Sentencing Advisory Council of Victoria. Standard sentences apply to a
  range of serious offences and must be considered as a guidepost by the court
  when making a sentencing decision. The last triple-murderer to be sentenced in
  Victoria was Robert Farquharson, who was convicted of murdering his children
  in 2007 and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 33
  years.
