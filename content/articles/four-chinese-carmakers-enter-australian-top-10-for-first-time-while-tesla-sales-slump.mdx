  Australians bought more than 20,000 Chinese-made vehicles in August, putting
  four Chinese brands into the top 10 for the first time, while Tesla sales have
  slumped by more than a third. BYD came in sixth for the month, overtaking
  Mitsubishi, after its sales nearly quadrupled compared with August 2024, while
  GWM, MG and Chery each outsold Isuzu Ute in the month to round out the top 10.
  Sign up: AU Breaking News email Chinese companies altogether sold 8,000 more
  cars in August than they did in the same month in 2024 and have surged in
  dominance in 2025 so far, according to the Federal Chamber of Automotive
  Industries’ VFACTS data. GWM has become the seventh-biggest company for the
  period January to August, with sales lifting to 34,000 from 28,000 in the same
  period in 2024. BYD has nearly tripled its sales to about 33,000. The market
  for cars has grown more diverse as Chinese carmakers have increasingly offered
  competitive prices and a greater range of electric vehicles, according to Tony
  Weber, chief executive of Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. “These
  companies are delivering vehicles that consumers want: modern, well-equipped
  and at competitive prices,” he said. Tesla, meanwhile, has seen sales slip
  over the year, according to separate data collated by the Electric Vehicles
  Council. Less than 18,000 Teslas were sold from January to August, whereas
  28,000 were sold over the same period in 2024, mirroring declines recorded in
  Europe. The biggest slump was in Tesla Model 3s, which has in previous years
  been Australia’s top-selling passenger car. Just 4,680 Model 3s have been sold
  in 2025 so far, where more than 12,000 had been sold in the same period in
  2024. The Tesla Model Y saw more sales in August 2025 than August 2024 but has
  seen sales slip over 2025 to date and faced a recall in late August over a
  software fault that could injure drivers. Tesla sales have suffered a steep
  decline since February after its chief executive Elon Musk’s apparent fascist
  salute at a Trump inauguration rally, which saw Australian drivers sell their
  Teslas or add anti-Musk bumper stickers. The “Elon effect” has provided an
  opportunity for Chinese carmakers to take over the Australian market,
  according to Scott Dwyer, associate professor and research director at the
  University of Technology Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures.
  “Australians have certainly been put off by some of the news coming out of the
  US … [and] people are looking elsewhere,” Dwyer said. “With the US tariffs as
  well, the Chinese [brands are] looking around saying ‘Where can we get a
  foothold, where can we sell and develop new markets?’” Dwyer pointed to car
  shows such as Sydney’s Everything Electric in March, where attenders test
  drove cars from brands including GWM and MG. “You can’t dismiss the word of
  mouth effect,” he said. “The Chinese [manufacturers] are particularly
  aggressive in their go-to-market strategy [and] allowing consumers to get up
  close and personal with their vehicles, and that’s creating a lot of
  confidence.” Mainstay brands continued to dominate sales and electric and
  hybrid sales accounted for less than 15,000 sales across the EVC and FCAI
  reports, compared to more than 90,000 non-electric sales. Dwyer predicted EV
  uptake would rise as more options and lower prices continued to arrive in
  Australia. “I definitely don’t think it’s a flash in the pan. This is
  something that’s here to stay.”
