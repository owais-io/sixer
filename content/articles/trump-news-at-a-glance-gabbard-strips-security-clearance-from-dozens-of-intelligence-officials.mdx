  National intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard said on Tuesday that she had
  stripped security clearances from 37 current and former national security
  officials, including some who worked on the intelligence community’s
  assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. In a memo
  posted on X, Gabbard accused the targeted individuals of having engaged in
  “politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified intelligence
  without authorization, and/or committing intentional egregious violations of
  tradecraft standards”. This move is the latest in a series of retributions by
  the Trump administration against national security officials and political
  opponents he views as adversaries. In March, Trump revoked security clearances
  for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and several other Democrats and critics. The
  order also stripped access from former secretary of state Antony Blinken,
  former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, New York attorney
  general Letitia James – who prosecuted Trump for fraud – and Biden’s entire
  family. Here are the key Trump administration news of the day: Trump rules out
  sending US troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees Donald Trump has
  ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential peace deal with
  Vladimir Putin, tempering a promise to provide Kyiv with security guarantees
  that European allies had called a significant breakthrough towards halting the
  Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Asked during a phone interview with Fox News
  whether he could assure listeners – including many members of his Maga base
  who support an isolationist America-first foreign policy – that the US would
  not put troops on the ground in Ukraine, Trump said: “You have my assurance,
  and I’m president.” Read the full story DoJ investigates DC police over
  allegedly fudged crime statistics Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal
  investigation into allegations that Washington DC police systematically
  manipulated crime statistics to make the city appear safer than it actually
  is. The probe, anonymous sources tell the Washington Post, NBC News and Fox
  News, being conducted by the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia
  under Jeanine Pirro, is the latest escalation between the Trump administration
  and DC officials over federal control of local policing. Read the full story
  Teen detained by Ice while walking dog A southern California community is
  calling for the release of a high school student whom US immigration agents
  arrested earlier this month while he was walking his dog. Benjamin Marcelo
  Guerrero-Cruz was supposed to be starting his senior year of high school at
  Reseda charter high school this month. But just days after his 18th birthday,
  masked Ice agents detained him as he walking his dog in the Los Angeles
  neighborhood of Van Nuys in what his family described as a kidnapping. Read
  the full story Trump administration speechwriter linked to hate speech online
  A speechwriter for the Trump administration’s Department of Homeland Security
  (DHS) has come under scrutiny after he was linked to hate speech online. Eric
  Lendrum compared the circumstances of American conservatives to that of
  enslaved people and Jewish people in Nazi Germany, and in his podcast claimed
  that the racist great replacement conspiracy theory was “real”, the news
  outlet Notus reported. Read the full story Republicans sue to block Newsom’s
  fast-track California redistricting plan Republican state legislators in
  California filed suit on Tuesday to block a mid-year redistricting plan meant
  to counter Texas’s effort to redraw congressional district lines. The
  emergency petition argues that the process being used in the California
  assembly violates laws requiring a 30-day period between the introduction of
  legislation and voting on it. Read the full story Electricity bill rise 10%
  amid Trump tariffs and green energy rollbacks Household electricity bills have
  increased by 10% since Donald Trump re-entered the White House, a new report
  has found, with its authors highlighting the impact of the president’s
  datacenter boosterism and cuts to clean energy projects as part of the cause.
  The analysis comes as the US energy secretary, Chris Wright, said he knows
  rising energy prices could be a political challenge for the GOP ahead of next
  year’s midterm elections, but claimed Democrats were to blame for the cost
  increases. Read the full story What else happened today: The Trump
  administration said on Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American” views,
  including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting
  to live in the United States. Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave Donald Trump a golf
  club during his visit to Washington this week that had belonged to a
  serviceman fighting Russia’s invasion, Kyiv said on Tuesday. India Walton has
  a warning message for progressive Democrats during Donald Trump’s second
  presidency: don’t water down your politics to win over the establishment.
