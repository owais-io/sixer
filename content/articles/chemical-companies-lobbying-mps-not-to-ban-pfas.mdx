  Chemical firms are lobbying MPs not to ban “forever chemicals” in the same way
  as proposed in the EU, using arguments disputed by scientists and described as
  “big tobacco playbook” tactics, it can be revealed. Pfas, short for per- and
  polyfluoroalkyl substances and commonly known as forever chemicals owing to
  their persistence in the environment, are a family of about 10,000 chemicals,
  some of which have been linked to a wide range of serious illnesses, including
  certain cancers. They are used across a range of industries, from cosmetics to
  firefighting. In May, MPs on the environmental audit committee (EAC) launched
  an inquiry into Pfas, with a call for evidence on the uses and risks of the
  substances, and options for how to regulate them. Exclusive analysis by the
  Ends Report and the Guardian of the responses submitted to the parliamentary
  committee has revealed major chemical producers, from UK-based companies to
  large US corporations, urging parliamentarians that any incoming UK Pfas
  regulation should be more limited than that currently proposed in the EU,
  which targets the whole family of chemicals. Specifically, many of the
  responses from chemicals firms analysed by the Ends Report call for a commonly
  used type of Pfas called fluoropolymers – used across a broad range of
  industries including domestic cookware production, such as non-stick frying
  pans, and pharmaceuticals – to be spared the same kind of regulation as other
  types of forever chemicals, on the basis that they are not as harmful. The
  validity of this argument, being made on record to UK politicians for the
  first time, has been disputed by scientists, with one stating that the
  chemicals industry is “copying the big tobacco playbook”. In 2021, the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) agreed that the
  way Pfas chemicals do not break down in the environment – their “persistence”
  – was a key, and defining, characteristic. In the EU, the European Chemicals
  Agency (ECHA) is evaluating a proposed restriction of Pfas using this OECD
  definition, which if implemented would set a global precedent. Dr Rainer
  Lohmann, a professor at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of
  Oceanography, said that when the OECD was developing its revised Pfas
  definition in 2021, “chemical industry experts were involved and saw no
  problem with [the ultimate definition]”, adding that “for the time being, most
  of my colleagues and I would say, yes, that’s the chemical definition we
  should stick with, those are Pfas”. AGC Chemicals Europe, one the UK’s major
  producers, based near Blackpool, wrote in its evidence submission to the EAC
  that “not all Pfas have identical hazards and risk profiles and shouldn’t be
  treated as a single group.” It continued: “Although fluoropolymers fit the
  Pfas structural definition, they are fundamentally different and should not be
  grouped together with other Pfas, which may be of concern since sources
  demonstrate that fluoropolymers have a low hazard profile, are non-toxic, not
  bioavailable, non-water-soluble, non-mobile, do not bioaccumulate, and have
  not demonstrated negative human health impacts.” A representative from DuPont
  de Nemours, the US multinational chemical company that became the subject of a
  Pfas legal battle dramatised in the film Dark Waters, wrote that the EU’s
  proposal “has created significant chaos, lack of interest in investment in
  [the] EU, and may lead to slower economic growth and innovation in the EU”.
  The Fluoropolymers Product Group (FPG) of Plastics Europe, a trade
  association, sought to cast doubt on the motivations behind ECHA’s proposals,
  writing in its evidence submission: “The main concerns driving regulators to
  include fluoropolymers in the proposed Pfas restriction under [the EU’s
  chemicals regulations] stem from their environmental persistence, despite
  fluoropolymers’ distinct safety profile compared to other Pfas.” However,
  experts said the idea that fluoropolymers were of little health or
  environmental concern was far off the mark. Lohmann said: “The production of
  fluoropolymers, and the use of fluoropolymers, by and large, has resulted in
  massive contamination of the areas where those plants are located.” “This
  magic claim that fluoropolymers are benign, and there’s no problem, just
  ignores the fact that wherever they are made and wherever they’re used, by and
  large, you have a major problem,” said Lohmann. Dr Shubhi Sharma, a scientific
  researcher at the chemicals charity Chem Trust, said “fluoropolymers are far
  more concerning chemicals than the industry claims”. She added that the OECD
  had clarified that there was no agreement that fluoropolymers were of “low
  concern”. “Yet the industry has continued to build on this myth and portray
  fluoropolymers as of ‘low concern’,” Sharma said. She continued that although
  the industry “complains about economic impacts of regulation, what they do not
  talk about is the enormous health costs associated with the Pfas pollution
  crisis”. In 2019, a European Environment Agency briefing stated that the
  “costs to society” arising from Pfas exposure were high, “with the annual
  health-related costs estimated to be €52-84bn across Europe” annually. What
  allows industry groups to say that fluoropolymers are non-toxic is that once
  they are made, they are stable chemicals. However, problems begin to emerge in
  their creation and disposal. According to the environmental charity Fidra,
  between 1950 and 2004, 72% of global emissions of PFOA and PFOS – two Pfas
  chemicals that are known and suspected carcinogens respectively – were linked
  to fluoropolymer production. However, this nuance appears to be lost in the
  industry responses analysed by the Ends Report. The Association of
  Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances, for example, told MPs in its evidence
  that it is “important to note that emissions of fluoropolymers can be
  effectively controlled across their entire life cycle”. Sharma said this was
  not the case, and that the disposal of fluoropolymer-containing wastes and
  products was “extremely difficult, if not impossible” because fluoropolymers
  are so persistent. “For example, landfilling of fluoropolymer-containing waste
  has been shown to result in emissions of further Pfas, which can then leach
  into surface and groundwater”, she said, adding that “the science is clear
  that fluoropolymers are highly problematic Pfas and to ensure effective
  protection from Pfas pollution, they should come under the remit of a group
  restriction in the UK”. For Dr Alex Ford, a biology professor at the
  University of Portsmouth, “there’s a lot of scaremongering at the moment” over
  the implications of an EU-style Pfas restriction. He said the responses
  submitted to the EAC are “copying the big tobacco playbook”, adding that Pfas
  compounds are “on a conveyor belt at different stages of deny, play down,
  claim it might not be as much of a problem”. Sharma said it was “a
  misconception” that the EU’s universal Pfas restriction was “a blanket ban and
  that it will automatically have adverse impacts on the economy”, adding that
  it “gives up to 13.5 years to sectors such as medicine, pharmaceuticals and
  green technologies like batteries and hydrogen to phase out Pfas”. The
  Chemical Industries Association was approached to respond to the claims that
  the industry was using “scaremongering” tactics from the Big Tobacco playbook.
  In response, the trade association pointed to its own EAC evidence submission,
  in which it stated that it “encourages policymakers not to treat all Pfas as a
  single group”. Its submission added: “Assuming they all have identical
  persistence, hazards, uses and therefore risk profiles – in our view is not a
  scientific approach, nor is it the reality for managing chemicals.”
