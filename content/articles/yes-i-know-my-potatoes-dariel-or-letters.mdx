  I must respond to a scathing attack on my gardening knowledge and integrity.
  Dariel Francis claims I am wrong about “leaving spuds in the ground till
  February” (Letters, 6 August). I never said I would – and I reject this
  scandalous and deeply hurtful accusation. I said “digging ground for potatoes”
  in February. That means manuring and preparing the ground, before planting the
  potatoes in March or April. Save our potatoes – and save our allotments!
  Jeremy Corbyn MP Independent, Islington North • May I, as a fellow
  allotmenteer and former parliamentary colleague of Jeremy Corbyn, defend him
  from the attempts to imply that his statement about “digging ground for
  potatoes in February” betrays an ignorance of the potato cultivation calendar?
  Like Jeremy, I will be digging the ground in February, but preparing the plot
  for the planting which, of course, takes place on Good Friday, and not lifting
  any of my maincrops, which will have been long scoffed or stored. Stephen
  Pound Labour MP 1997-2019; chair, Framfield Allotment Association • Dariel
  Francis should have kept her eyes peeled and read the quote from Jeremy Corbyn
  more carefully. Like those of many current Labour voters, this attempt at
  discrediting Mr Corbyn is half-baked. Dr Barbara Henderson Spittal,
  Northumberland • Jeremy Corbyn may inadvertently have stumbled on a name for
  his new party (Jeremy Corbyn warns rules on council asset sales threaten
  allotments, 5 August). The Allotment party embraces opposition to local
  authorities selling off public land, green issues and community involvement,
  with a nod to allotting tasks in a democratic way. Perfect. Toby Wood
