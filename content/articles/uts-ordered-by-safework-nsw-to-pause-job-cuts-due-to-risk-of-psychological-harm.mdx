  The University of Technology Sydney has been forced to pause a plan to slash
  hundreds of jobs after a rare intervention by SafeWork NSW, which said workers
  would be subject to a “serious and imminent risk of psychological harm” if
  management pushed ahead. Under the ruling, UTS cancelled all meetings
  scheduled on Wednesday and Thursday with about 800 impacted staff and paused
  the release of its change proposal, which was to be rolled out this week.
  Academics at UTS had described feelings of stress and a “culture of fear”
  after the university temporarily paused student enrolments for 120 of its 615
  courses until the end of the autumn 2026 semester, including master’s degrees
  in primary and secondary teaching. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In April,
  UTS told staff that 150 academics and 250 operational employees – or about a
  tenth of the workforce – could lose their jobs as the university pursued $100m
  in cost cuts. UTS is yet to specify which jobs will be made redundant. The
  prohibition notice regarding the job cuts, seen by Guardian Australia, was
  issued on Tuesday after SafeWork NSW investigated psychosocial hazards
  stemming from the restructure. The issuing inspector, Mostafa Issa, said he
  reasonably believed UTS workers would be exposed to a “serious and imminent
  risk of psychological harm” as a result of UTS’s Academic Change Proposal, in
  contravention of the Work Health and Safety Act and the Work Health and Safety
  Regulation. The notice will be in effect until SafeWork NSW is satisfied that
  appropriate safety measures have been put in place as a result of consultation
  with workers. UTS has 14 days to submit for a review. An email sent to staff
  by the vice-chancellor of UTS, Prof Andrew Parfitt, on Tuesday confirmed that
  both meetings scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday and the release of the
  change proposal had been “paused” and “will not be taking place this week”.
  “Following engagement with SafeWork NSW today, we have been requested to take
  more time to consider additional feedback from health and safety
  representatives on psychosocial measures and controls,” he said. “We recognise
  and regret that this will be adding to the uncertainty felt by our staff.” A
  UTS spokesperson said on Wednesday that the university had been discussing
  options with staff “since late last year” but that it needed to release the
  change proposal for consultation to go ahead, which it had been ready to do
  “since July”. “The safety and wellbeing of our staff and the management of
  psychosocial risks are of paramount importance to us. We are frustrated by the
  ongoing delays in releasing the change proposal for consultation and are very
  concerned about the impact this is having on our community. We are aware of
  staff expressing concerns about the effect these protracted delays are having
  on their wellbeing,” the spokesperson said. The National Tertiary Education
  Union (NTEU) NSW division secretary, Vince Caughley, said SafeWork NSW’s
  intervention was a “rare and damning rebuke that underlines just how reckless
  these cuts have been”. “It also raises profound questions for the public about
  how UTS – and other NSW universities – are being governed,” he said. “The
  scale of job and course cuts across the sector, and the repeated failures of
  management to act responsibly, show that these institutions have drifted away
  from their public mission. The public is entitled to ask whether those
  entrusted with running our universities are fit for the task.” Caughley said
  despite the NTEU presenting alternatives to the cuts based on expert analysis,
  UTS management had dismissed the majority of staff concerns and suggestions.
  UTS allowed the union to view a document outlining alternatives to job cuts
  prepared by KPMG, which has a $4.8m contract with the university. “The need to
  reduce expenditure is necessary as we have had deficits for five years and our
  revenue does not cover our ongoing operating costs … It’s important we address
  this to protect and invest in our teaching, research and our students,” the
  UTS spokesperson said on Wednesday. “We reject the NTEU’s contention that we
  have not adequately conducted preliminary consultation on the need for the
  changes and the desired outcomes.” The NTEU’s UTS branch president, Dr Sarah
  Attfield, said staff had been under “immense stress” and had been met with
  “dismissal after dismissal” from management. “I hope this decision makes it
  clear to management that staff have legitimate concerns and they can’t just
  ram through changes that prioritise profit over people,” Attfield said. The
  NTEU national president, Dr Alison Barnes, said the SafeWork NSW finding
  exposed a “governance crisis” facing higher education. “University executives
  pursuing reckless job cuts that tear at the fabric of public universities,
  while dismissing the expertise and concerns of their own staff,” Barnes said.
  “The fact that a workplace safety regulator had to step in to protect
  university workers speaks volumes about how disconnected university management
  has become.” Two disputes lodged by the NTEU with UTS management are ongoing
  in the Fair Work Commission.
