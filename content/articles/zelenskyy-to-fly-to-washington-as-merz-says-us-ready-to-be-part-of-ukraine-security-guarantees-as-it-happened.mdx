  It is almost 6.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. We will be closing this blog soon, but
  you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Russia-Ukraine war coverage here.
  Here’s a recap of the developments from today: Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet president Trump in Washington on Monday after
  Trumps’s summit with Putin resulted in no ceasefire deal. The US and Russian
  leaders met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the
  former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private
  talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.
  Regarding the upcoming meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump wrote in a post on social
  media platform Truth Social that, “If it all works out, we will then schedule
  a meeting with President Putin. Potentially, millions of people’s lives will
  be saved.” Trump publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire he had
  himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin’s preferred path of
  pushing through a far-reaching “Peace Agreement” before halting any fighting.
  “Unfortunately, Trump has taken Putin’s position, and this was Putin’s
  demand,” Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign
  affairs committee, told Reuters on Saturday. Speaking to German public
  broadcaster ZDF, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Saturday that the United
  States was ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine. The European
  Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen also said in a post on X that
  strong security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe were “essential” in any
  peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump’s debriefing to European leaders
  after the Alaska summit with Putin included discussions about security
  guarantees for Ukraine, which is outside Nato. A source familiar with the
  matter told Reuters that the guarantees would be equivalent to article 5,
  which states that if a Nato ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and
  every other member of the Alliance will consider this as an armed attack
  against all members. Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that the
  discussion of security guarantees was area where “most interesting
  developments” happened during the Trump-Putin Alaska summit. After a
  debriefing from president Trump, the European Commission released a joint
  pledge to back Ukraine, emphasising that “Ukraine must have ironclad security
  guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We
  welcome President Trump’s statement that the US is prepared to give security
  guarantees. The coalition of the willing is ready to play an active role. No
  limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation
  with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to
  EU and Nato. It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory.
  International borders must not be changed by force.” Several European leaders
  lauded Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine. UK prime minister Keir
  Starmer said in a statement: “President Trump’s efforts have brought us closer
  than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. His leadership in
  pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended.” The Czech foreign
  minister Jan Lipavský said he was “glad that President Trump is trying to stop
  the war” but that there has been “propagandistic nonsense about the ‘roots of
  the conflict’” from Putin in the subsequent press conference. European leaders
  have been invited to attend the Monday meeting with US president Donald Trump
  and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, the New York
  Times reported on Saturday, citing two senior European officials. During the
  Alaska meeting, Putin told Trump that he would freeze the frontline in the
  southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in exchange for the Donetsk
  region of Ukraine, according to a Financial Times report. In a statement
  posted on the social media platform X earlier on Saturday, the Ukrainian
  president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “All issues important to Ukraine must be
  discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial
  ones, can be decided without Ukraine.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia
  may step up its attacks on Ukraine following the inconclusive Putin-Trump
  summit and the news that the Ukrainian leader would fly to Washington to meet
  the US president on Monday. Two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike
  on Russia’s Kursk region, the local governor said on Saturday. A blast at a
  factory in the Russian region of Ryazan on Friday killed 11 people and left
  130 injured, Russia’s emergencies ministry said on Saturday. Some Russian
  media outlets reported that the explosion was caused by gunpowder catching
  fire. The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken Kolodyazi village
  in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to state media reports on Saturday. The
  Guardian could not independently verify battlefield reports. Trump reportedly
  hand-delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting. The
  letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in Ukraine – for
  which Putin is wanted by the international criminal court – White House
  officials said, without providing further details. The United States is ready
  to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine, German chancellor, Friedrich
  Merz, said on Saturday after a summit in Alaska between the US president,
  Donald Trump, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ended without a
  ceasefire deal. Merz was speaking to the German public broadcaster ZDF after
  being briefed together with other European leaders by Trump on his talks with
  Putin. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told Donald Trump that he would
  freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in
  exchange for the Donetsk region of Ukraine, the Financial Times reports. The
  Russian leader made the request during his meeting with Trump in Alaska on
  Friday, the FT said, citing four people with direct knowledge of the talks. In
  a statement posted on the social media platform X earlier on Saturday, the
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “All issues important to
  Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue,
  particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine.” Trump sent
  another fundraising email to supporters where he mentioned meeting with Putin
  in Alaska on Saturday, according to NBC News reports. “I met with Putin in
  Alaska yesterday! After my meeting with him, I need you to answer just one
  question … Do you still stand with Donald Trump?” the email said. This comes
  after Trump’s campaign sent an email seeking donations on Friday, ahead of the
  Alaska summit. Yesterday’s email read, “I’m meeting with Putin in Alaska! It’s
  a little chilly. THIS MEETING IS VERY HIGH STAKES for the world. The Democrats
  would love nothing more than for ME TO FAIL. No one in the world knows how to
  make deals like me!” European leaders are invited to attend a Monday meeting
  with US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at
  the White House, the New York Times reported on Saturday, citing two senior
  European officials. The meeting comes after a summit between Trump and Russian
  president Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, which Washington said resulted
  in “great progress” but no deal to end the conflict in Ukraine. Two people, a
  52-year-old man and his 13-year-old son, were killed in a Ukrainian drone
  strike on Russia’s Kursk region, the local governor said on Saturday. In a
  statement published on Telegram, the Kursk governor, Alexander Khinshtein,
  said that the two had been killed when their car caught fire as a result of a
  drone strike. Khinshtein said that the attack took place in Rylsk district, a
  border area close to the part of Kursk region that Ukraine occupied between
  August 2024 and March this year. Here are the latest photos coming in: The
  “coalition of the willing” leaders will meet via video conference on Sunday
  afternoon ahead of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on
  Monday, the French presidency office said on Saturday. The meeting will be
  co-presided by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor,
  Friedrich Merz, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the office said.
  Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, has warned that the battle for Ukraine’s
  future and European security has reached a “decisive phase” as he urged the
  west to maintain unity in its opposition to Vladimir Putin, who he labelled a
  “cunning and ruthless player”. The game for Ukraine’s future, Poland’s
  security, and all of Europe has entered a decisive phase. Today, it is even
  clearer that Russia respects only the strong, and Putin has once again proven
  to be a cunning and ruthless player. Therefore, maintaining the unity of the
  entire West is so important. Earlier this week, US president Donald Trump at
  the last minute requested Maga-allied Polish president Karol Nawrocki join the
  Ukraine teleconference with European leaders on Wednesday, according to
  centrist Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, who had initally been expected to
  attend. Nawrocki, not Tusk, was present on the call between Trump and European
  leaders on Friday night after the summit with Putin in Alaska. Nawrocki, a
  conservative nationalist and Eurosceptic, is an ally of Trump’s right-wing
  populist Maga political movement and visited the White House during Poland’s
  presidential election campaign this year. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that
  Russia may step up its attacks on Ukraine following the inconclusive
  Putin-Trump summit and the news that the Ukrainian leader would fly to
  Washington to meet the US president on Monday. In a post on X, he wrote: Based
  on the political and diplomatic situation around Ukraine, and knowing Russia’s
  treachery, we anticipate that in the coming days the Russian army may try to
  increase pressure and strikes against Ukrainian positions in order to create
  more favorable political circumstances for talks with global actors. Agence
  France-Presse has been speaking to some ordinary Ukrainians to get their view
  of the summit, and it’s fair to say they are pretty unimpressed. Pavlo Nebroev
  stayed up until the middle of the night in Kharkiv, which has suffered
  repeated Russian bombardments, to wait for the press conference. The
  38-year-old theatre manager said: I saw the results I expected. I think this
  is a great diplomatic victory for Putin. He has completely legitimised
  himself.” Nebroev, like many Ukrainians, was gobsmacked the meeting could take
  place without representatives of his country. This was a useless meeting.
  Issues concerning Ukraine should be resolved with Ukraine, with the
  participation of Ukrainians, the president.” Olya Donik, 36, said she was not
  surprised by the turn of events as she walked through a sunny park in Kharkiv
  with Nebroev. “It ended with nothing. Alright, let’s continue living our lives
  here in Ukraine,” she said. “Whether there are talks or not, Kharkiv is being
  shelled almost every day. Kharkiv definitely doesn’t feel any change,” said
  Iryna Derkach, a 50-year-old photographer. We believe in victory, we know it
  will come, but God only knows who exactly will bring it about”. Derkach, like
  many Ukrainians, was suspicious of Trump. “We do our job and don’t pay too
  much attention to what Trump is doing,” she added. Pharmacist Larysa Melnyk
  did not think her country was any closer to seeing peace. “I don’t think there
  will be a truce,” she told AFP, adding that even if the guns fall silent, it
  will only be temporarily. Russia’s reaction to Donald Trump’s summit with
  Vladimir Putin in Alaska has been nothing short of jubilant, with Moscow
  celebrating the fact that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without
  making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s
  ceasefire demands. “The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without
  preconditions,” wrote former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram. He added
  that the summit showed that talks could continue as Russia wages war in
  Ukraine. Trump entered the high-stakes summit warning, “I won’t be happy if I
  walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe
  consequences” if Moscow refused to cooperate. But after a three-hour meeting
  with the Russian side that yielded no tangible results, Trump shelved his
  threats and instead insisted that the meeting was “extremely productive,” even
  as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for ending the war and announced no
  concessions on the battlefield, where Russian forces are consolidating key
  gains in eastern Ukraine. Read the full article here: The European Commission
  president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a post on X that strong security
  guarantees for Ukraine and Europe were “essential” in any peace deal to end
  the war in Ukraine. “The EU is working closely with Zelenskyy and the United
  States to reach a just and lasting peace. Strong security guarantees that
  protect Ukrainian and European vital security interests are essential,” von
  der Leyen posted on Saturday. The EU leaders are emphasising the issue of
  security guarantees, something Ukraine has been seeking as the minimum feature
  to secure its future ability to defend itself in the absence of membership of
  Nato, which is still wants. More statements have been issued after the
  Trump-Putin summit in Alaska ended in no peace agreement. The European Union’s
  foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement on Saturday that Russia
  has no intention of ending its war in Ukraine “anytime soon” but that the US
  “holds the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously”. The French
  president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a statement on X that France would work
  with the US and partners in the “coalition of the willing” to make progress on
  a lasting peace with security guarantees. That coalition will meet in the near
  future, Macron added. The spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, Randhir
  Jaiswal, said on Saturday: “The way forward can only be through dialogue and
  diplomacy. The world wants to see an early end to the conflict in Ukraine.”
  The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, who has diverged from most western
  allies by visiting Moscow twice since last year and refusing to provide
  official military aid to Ukraine, said in a recorded statement on Facebook:
  “The coming days will show whether the big players in the Union will support
  this process … or whether the unsuccessful European strategy of trying to
  weaken Russia through this conflict with all kinds of literally incredible
  financial, political or military assistance to Kyiv will continue.” In a
  statement posted on the social media platform X, the Ukrainian president,
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the
  long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the US. “All issues
  important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no
  issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided witout Ukraine.” He said
  that Ukraine needed a real, long-lasting peace and not “just another pause”
  between Russian invasions, and stressed to Trump during their call that
  sanctions should be strengthened. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,
  has said that the discussion of security guarantees was area where “most
  interesting developments” happened during the Trump-Putin Alaska summit,
  Reuters reported on Saturday. Meloni also said that Trump has followed the
  Italian idea of security guarantees “inspired by Nato’s article 5”. In Trump’s
  debriefing to European leaders after the Alaska summit with Putin, there were
  discussions about security guarantees for Ukraine, which is outside Nato. A
  source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the guarantees would be
  equivalent to article 5, which states that if a Nato ally is the victim of an
  armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this
  as an armed attack against all members. In a joint statement published earlier
  today, the European Council said: “No limitations should be placed on
  Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia
  cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato.” A senior
  Ukrainian parliamentarian said on Saturday that by proposing to abandon a
  ceasefire agreement in favour of a peace agreement, Trump is taking Vladimir
  Putin’s position. “Unfortunately, Trump has taken Putin’s position, and this
  was Putin’s demand,” Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the Ukrainian
  parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told Reuters. “In Putin’s view, a
  peace agreement means several dangerous things – Ukraine not joining Nato, his
  absurd demands for denazification and demilitarisation, the Russian language
  and the Russian church,” he said. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has
  released an official statement on Ukraine after the Alaska summit held between
  president Trump and president Putin. The statement said: “President Trump’s
  efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war
  in Ukraine. His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be
  commended.” It echoed the joint statement released by the European Council by
  reiterating: “the next step must be further talks involving President
  Zelenskyy. The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him.”
  Starmer continued: “This morning, I spoke to President Zelenskyy, President
  Trump and other European partners, and we all stand ready to support this next
  phase. I welcome the openness of the United States, alongside Europe, to
  provide robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any deal. This is
  important progress and will be crucial in deterring Putin from coming back for
  more. In the meantime, until he stops his barbaric assault, we will keep
  tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions, which have
  already had a punishing impact on the Russian economy and its people. Our
  unwavering support for Ukraine will continue as long as it takes.” The
  European Council have released a joint statement by the French president,
  Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the German
  chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the
  Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk,
  the European Council president, António Costa and the European Commission
  president, Ursula von der Leyen. The statement, in response to Trump’s meeting
  with Putin in Alaska which secured no peace agreement, said: “Leaders welcomed
  President Trump’s efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of
  aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace. As President Trump said
  ‘there’s no deal until there’s a deal’. As envisioned by President Trump, the
  next step must now be further talks including President Zelenskyy, whom he
  will meet soon. We are also ready to work with President Trump and President
  Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support.” The statement
  emphasised that “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees to effectively
  defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome President Trump’s
  statement that the US is prepared to give security guarantees. The coalition
  of the willing is ready to play an active role. No limitations should be
  placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries.
  Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato. It will be
  up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must
  not be changed by force.” It added: “Our support to Ukraine will continue. We
  are determined to do more to keep Ukraine strong in order to achieve an end to
  the fighting and a just and lasting peace. As long as the killing in Ukraine
  continues, we stand ready to uphold the pressure on Russia. We will continue
  to strengthen sanctions and wider economic measures to put pressure on
  Russia’s war economy until there is a just and lasting peace. Ukraine can
  count on our unwavering solidarity as we work towards a peace that safeguards
  Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” European leaders are to
  release a joint statement after discussing Donald Trump’s meeting with
  Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, wrote on X:
  “The conversation among European leaders evaluating the information provided
  by President Trump and the outcomes of the Alaska meeting has concluded.” He
  added: “Together with @EmmanuelMacron, @—FriedrichMerz, @Keir—Starmer,
  @GiorgiaMeloni, we listened to the opinions of @ZelenskyyUa and prepared a
  joint statement.” He did not say when the statement would be made public. The
  Russian defence ministry has said its forces have taken Kolodyazi village in
  Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to state media reports on Saturday.
  Russian state media also reported that forces have taken Vorone village in the
  neighbouring Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine. The Guardian could not
  independently verify battlefield reports. President Donald Trump has said that
  Ukrainian president Zelenskyy will be coming to the DC Oval Office on Monday
  afternoon, Reuters reports. The report added that “if it all works out”, Trump
  intends to “schedule a meeting with president Putin”. According to Reuters,
  Trump has said during the Alaska summit it was determined that the best way to
  end the war in Ukraine is “to go directly to a peace deal, not ceasefire”. We
  will have more on this as the story develops. There has been speculation on
  the social media platform X about an air ceasefire, according to reports from
  Oliver Carroll, a foreign correspondent for the Economist. Carroll said on
  Saturday: “I’m told there is provisional agreement of an air ceasefire until
  3-way leaders meeting. ‘We think the skies will give signals about provisional
  results of these talks,’ source tells me. ‘The next week will be
  interesting.’” Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communication adviser Dmytro Lytvyn
  responded to the post, writing: “We haven’t heard anything about it yet”.
  There have been no reports of a ceasefire deal from Washington or Moscow.
  During what was billed as a joint news conference after the Alaska summit,
  Putin claimed that some sort of agreement had been reached, but Trump said
  that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no
  questions. A blast at a factory in the Russian region of Ryazan on Friday
  killed 11 people and left 130 injured, Russia’s emergencies ministry said on
  Saturday. In a statement on Telegram, the ministry said rescuers were
  continuing to search through rubble at the scene of the blast, 200 miles
  (320km) south-east of Moscow. The Ryazan regional governor, Pavel Malkov, said
  on Friday that the incident had been triggered by a fire breaking out inside a
  workshop at the factory. There was no cause given for the fire, not was it
  clear what the factory produced. Ukrainian drones have previously targeted
  military and economic infrastructure in Ryazan region. In January, a major oil
  refinery and power station had been hit by Ukrainian drones. Some Russian
  media outlets reported that the explosion was caused by gunpowder catching
  fire. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke on the phone with Donald
  Trump and European partners on Saturday morning after the meeting between
  Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the Élysée office said in a statement on
  Saturday. The phone conversation lasted for one hour and other there were
  seven other European leaders present, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Friedrich
  Merz, Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni, Alexander Stubb and Karol Nawrocki, as
  well as the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, the statement said. We are
  yet to hear from Sir Keir Starmer’s government, but other European politicians
  have been reacting. Italy’s deputy PM, Matteo Salvini said: “Every step
  forward towards peace, like this one, is good news. As Pope Leo said, may
  diplomacy speak again in place of weapons, without anyone obstructing it.” The
  Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said: “President Putin of Russia
  reiterated known arguments, such as emphasising the so-called ‘root causes’ of
  the war, which is code for the Russian justification for the illegal invasion
  of Ukraine.” He added it was important to keep pressure on Russia and listen
  to Ukraine’s wishes and needs. The Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavský said he
  was “glad that President Trump is trying to stop the war” but that there has
  been “propagandistic nonsense about the ‘roots of the conflict’” from Putin in
  the subsequent press conference. “The problem is Russian imperialism, not
  Ukraine’s desire to live freely,” he continued. “If Putin were serious about
  negotiating peace, he would not have been attacking Ukraine all day today.”
  Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, accused Putin of making “some
  more gaslighting and veiled threats” towards Ukraine and Europe in the press
  conference, in which the Russian leader said he hoped the countries “will not
  try to sabotage the talks”. Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orbán, wrote on Facebook:
  “For years, we have watched the two largest nuclear powers eliminate the
  framework of their cooperation and send messages to each other.” He added
  “It’s over now. The world is a safer place today than it was yesterday.”
  President Trump told Zelenskyy and Nato leaders that Putin doesn’t want a
  ceasefire and prefers a comprehensive agreement to end the war, the Axios
  reporter Barak Ravid posted on X. The post added that Trump has said: “I think
  a fast peace deal is better than a ceasefire.” Russia’s initial reaction to
  the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin summit has been decisively positive, with
  Moscow highlighting that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without
  making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s
  ceasefire demands. “The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without
  preconditions and simultaneously with the continuation of the ‘special
  military operation’,” wrote the former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram,
  using Russia’s preferred term for its invasion of Ukraine. Medvedev, now the
  deputy chair of Russia’s security council, welcomed the fact that Putin was
  able to “personally and in detail present” Russia’s maximalist conditions for
  ending the war. In Alaska, Putin repeated his familiar line that the “root
  causes” of the conflict must be addressed – demands that in practice would
  severely limit Ukraine’s sovereignty. He also picked up on Trump’s remarks
  that the pressure now lies with Kyiv, indirectly referring to the US
  president’s blunt message that Zelenskyy “gotta make a deal”. “Both sides
  directly placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on
  ending military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev wrote. Russian state
  media and the Kremlin elite were already in high spirits as Trump rolled out
  the red carpet for Putin, who is wanted by The Hague for war crimes. “Western
  media are on the verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry
  spokesperson Maria Zakharova as Putin landed in Alaska. “For three years they
  told everyone Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet
  laid out for the Russian president in the US,” she added. Ukrainian president
  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that he plans to meet Trump in Washington on
  Monday after Trumps’s summit with Putin. “Ukraine reaffirms its readiness to
  work with maximum effort to achieve peace,” Zelenskyy said on X on Saturday.
  “We support President Trump’s proposal for a trilateral meeting between
  Ukraine, the USA, and Russia. Ukraine emphasises that key issues can be
  discussed at the level of leaders, and a trilateral format is suitable for
  this,” he added. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is planning to
  meet Donald Trump in Washington as soon as Monday, the Axios reporter Barak
  Ravid said on X on Saturday. Zelenskyy has said that his call with Trump
  lasted more than an hour and a half, and that Ukraine supports trilateral
  meetings. He added that Europe should be part of these talks at all stages.
  For those joining us now, here’s what you might have missed. Donald Trump and
  Vladimir Putin met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in
  the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private
  talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine.
  Ukrainian observers were horrified that Trump laid out a red carpet for Putin,
  and even applauded him. The meeting, billed as a summit, came to an end much
  earlier than scheduled, after the first of what was supposed to have been two
  rounds of talks. Reporters were summoned for what was billed as a joint news
  conference, but were instead treated to a pair of brief statements that
  lasted, in total, 12 minutes. After Putin claimed that some sort of agreement
  had been reached, Trump said that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly
  ended the event, taking no questions. The White House said Trump has had a
  “lengthy” call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Nato
  leaders, on the plane after the meeting before he returned to DC. The meeting
  was criticised by Democrats, some European officials, Ukrainian media outlets,
  Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, and the former US national security
  advisor, John Bolton, who said “Putin clearly won”. A Fox News reporter called
  it “really stunning” that Putin spoke first in the event. In a post-summit
  interview with his supporter Sean Hannity, Trump said that the meeting with
  Putin had been “a 10” and suggested that Putin “spoke very sincerely” about
  his desire to end the war in Ukraine. Trump also claimed to Hannity that
  Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals
  who could challenge him in elections, told him that the 2020 US presidential
  election “was rigged” and “you can’t have an honest election with mail-in
  voting.’” Trump reportedly hand-delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to
  Putin at the meeting. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during
  the war in Ukraine – for which Putin is wanted by the international criminal
  court – White House officials said, without providing further details.
  Overnight, Russia launched 85 attack drones and a ballistic missile targeting
  Ukraine’s territory, Ukraine’s air force said. Few in Ukraine are surprised at
  the apparent lack of outcome in the Alaska summit. There was little to no
  expectation of progress towards a ceasefire, never mind an actual cessation of
  hostilities, given Putin’s long history of aggression and intransigence
  towards the country. Though Trump said that the leaders had a “very productive
  meeting”, the look on his face suggested otherwise. Critical for Ukraine’s
  leadership today will be to understand if Putin’s maximalist negotiating
  position has adjusted at all - and how the US leader responded to the demands
  of his Russian counterpart. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said
  repeatedly that he did not believe that Putin was a good faith negotiator and
  has expressed the belief that Donald Trump would eventually conclude the same
  for himself. The hope in Kyiv will now be that Trump can be gently steered
  towards closer support for Ukraine and consider moving forward with measures
  such as secondary sanctions on Russia oil exports. But there is also a grim
  anxiety. Russian missile and drone attacks into Ukraine have been reduced in
  the days running up to the summit. Now the meeting is over, the fear is that a
  return to large scale night time assaults could follow. Vladimir Putin remains
  determined to “revive the Soviet Union” by “destroying democracy next door”,
  Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, has said. Speaking to
  Australia’s national broadcaster, in the wake of the meeting, Myroshnychenko
  pushed back on Putin’s rhetoric about needing to solve the “root causes” of
  the conflict. He said the root cause of the conflict from Putin’s perspective
  was a sovereign, independent and democratic Ukraine. “When Putin talks about
  the ‘root cause of war’, it’s an independent Ukraine on the map of Europe.
  That’s the only cause of war for Russia,” he said. “Putin is just out there on
  his mission to revive the Soviet Union, to revive the Russian empire, and it
  can’t be revived without Ukraine. Just overnight, as we speak, Russians have
  attacked many Ukrainian cities, sent many drones. So we don’t really see any
  indication of him ending his war.” Read more here: The Kremlin aide Yuri
  Ushakov says there was no discussion of a three-way summit between the
  Russian, US and Ukrainian presidents, the Russian state news agency Tass
  reported. After the meeting, Trump had told reporters it was now up to
  Zelenskyy to “get it done” and that a meeting would be set up between the
  Ukrainian president and Putin, which Trump might attend. Ushakov said he did
  not know yet when Putin and Trump would meet again after Friday’s summit in
  Alaska. More reaction from Europe to the meeting: the Czech defence minister,
  Jana Černochová, has said the summit showed that the Russian president is not
  looking for peace and wants to weaken western unity. “The Trump-Putin talks in
  Alaska did not bring significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine,
  but they confirmed that Putin is not seeking peace, but rather an opportunity
  to weaken western unity and spread his propaganda,” she wrote on X, adding
  that the west must continue supporting Ukraine. The White House press
  secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has told reporters that Trump had a “lengthy”
  call with Ukrainian president Zelenskyy on the plane back to DC, and is now on
  the phone to Nato leaders, according to wire agencies and reporters in the
  White House pool. There are no further details just yet. The Senate Democratic
  leader, Chuck Schumer, has accused Trump of rolling out the red carpet “for an
  authoritarian thug” in what was “just theatre”, not diplomacy. “Instead of
  standing with Ukraine and our allies, Trump stood shoulder to shoulder with an
  autocrat that has terrorised the Ukrainian people and the globe for years,”
  Schumer said in a statement. “While we wait for critical details of what was
  discussed- on first take it appears Trump handed Putin legitimacy, a global
  stage, zero accountability, and got nothing in return.” Schumer has been
  joined by other Democrats in criticising the meeting. Ken Martin, chair of the
  Democratic National Committee, said: “Donald Trump has been cozying up to
  Vladimir Putin for years, and this meeting underscored the depth of his sick
  obsession with the Russian dictator and accused war criminal.” He added:
  “Trump has been clear that his foreign policy agenda is letting Russia ‘do
  whatever the hell they want’ – no matter how disastrous for the US and our
  allies – and when put to the test, Trump embarrassed the United States by
  folding like a cheap suit.” Meanwhile Democrat senator Mark Kelly told Trump
  he should “ink the deal first”. Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide,
  says it is too early to tell if the meeting resulted in any progress. “We must
  continue to put pressure on Russia, and even increase it, to give the clear
  signal to Russia that it must pay the price [for its invasion of Ukraine],”
  Eide told reporters in Oslo. Earlier this month Eide had said on X that he
  welcomed Trump’s “initiative to bring Russia’s illegal war to an end”. But had
  added: “Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine. A dignified peace must be a
  lasting and just peace. No decision about Ukraine should be made without
  Ukraine. Its sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity must be respected.” As
  Trump and Putin met in Alaska, Russia launched 85 attack drones and a
  ballistic missile targeting Ukraine’s territory, Ukraine’s Air Force said on
  Saturday. Frontline territories in the Sumy, Donetsk, Chernihiv, and
  Dnipropetrovsk regions were targeted in the overnight strikes, the air force
  said on the Telegram messaging app. It said its air defence units destroyed 61
  of the drones. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said in its daily
  morning report that 139 clashes had taken place on the front line over the
  past day. Meanwhile Russian media, citing the country’s defence ministry, said
  Russia’s air defence systems intercepted and destroyed 29 Ukrainian drones
  overnight over various Russian regions, including 10 downed over the Rostov
  region. David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, has been in
  Anchorage for the meeting, which provided quite a bit of material for his
  political sketch: That was the moment he knew it was true love. Donald Trump
  turned to gaze at Vladimir Putin as the Russian president publicly endorsed
  his view that, had Trump been president instead of Joe Biden, the war in
  Ukraine would never have happened. “Today President Trump was saying that if
  he was president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it
  would indeed be so,” Putin said. “I can confirm that.” Vladimir, you complete
  me, Trump might have replied. To hell with all those Democrats, democrats,
  wokesters, fake news reporters and factcheckers. Here is a man who speaks my
  authoritarian alternative facts language. The damned doubters had been worried
  about Friday’s big summit at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era
  airbase under a big sky and picturesque mountains on the outskirts of
  Anchorage, Alaska. They feared that it might resemble Neville Chamberlain’s
  appeasement of Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938, or Winston Churchill, Franklin
  Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin carving up the world for the great powers at the
  Yalta Conference in 1945. It was worse than that. You can read Smith’s full
  dispatch here. “Sickening. Shameful. And in the end, useless.” The Kyiv
  Independent has published a blistering editorial on the Trump Putin meeting.
  Trump didn’t get what he wanted. But Putin? He sure did. From the moment he
  stepped off the plane on US soil, the Russian dictator was beaming. No longer
  an international pariah, he was finally getting accepted – and respected — by
  the leader of the free world. Trump’s predecessor once called Putin a
  murderer; Trump offered him a king’s welcome. The English-language Ukrainian
  outlet’s editorial compared the “king’s welcome” for Putin to Trump’s hostile
  reception of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office just six months ago. “Ukraine’s
  president endured a public shaming. Russia’s was pampered. Both episodes were
  disgraceful,” it said. “Trump fails to grasp that Putin isn’t transactional
  about Ukraine – he is messianic. He wants Ukraine for Russia, period. For
  Putin and his inner circle, Ukraine’s independence is an accident, and they
  are correcting it.” “Trump did not lose, but Putin clearly won,” former US
  ambassador to the UN and national security adviser John Bolton has told CNN.
  “Trump didn’t come away with anything except more meetings. Putin has, I
  think, gone a long way to reestablishing the relationship, which I’ve always
  believed is his key goal. He has escaped sanctions, he’s not facing a
  ceasefire, the next meeting is not set, [Ukrainian president] Zelenskyy was
  not told any of this before this press conference. It’s far from over but I’d
  say Putin achieved most of what he wanted and Trump achieved very little.”
  “And I would say one other thing. Trump looked very tired up there,” Bolton
  added. “Not disappointed, tired. And we’ll have to reflect on what that
  means.” The Trump-Putin meeting drew some crowds of onlookers Anchorage.
  Protesters unveiled a massive Ukrainian flag, in support of the country that
  Putin invaded in 2022 and has waged war on since. Elsewhere, Trump supporters
  gathered by the roadside to welcome the US president. While in Alaska, Putin
  made a couple of side visits, according to Russia’s foreign ministry. He laid
  flowers at the graves of Soviet soldiers At the Fort Richardson Memorial
  Cemetery he laid flowers at the graves of Soviet pilots and sailors who died
  during the second world war. He also met with Archbishop Alexei, of the
  Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Alaska, perhaps an attempt to remind
  people that Alaska used to be part of Russia. Trump hand delivered a letter
  from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting, White House officials have
  told Reuters. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war
  in Ukraine, they said, without providing further details. Tens of thousands of
  Ukrainian children have been abducted, taken to Russia or Russian-occupied
  territories without the consent of families or guardians, which Ukraine has
  called a war crime that meets the UN treaty definition of genocide. Putin has
  been indicted by the International Criminal Court for the alleged war crime of
  unlawful deportation and transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine
  to the Russian Federation. “There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr
  Putin bears individual criminal responsibility,” the charge says. Moscow has
  previous said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone.
  Melania Trump was not on the Alaska trip, however she is emerging as one of
  the strongest influences on her husband, whose inner circle tends to shift as
  people fall in and out of favour. Trump has credited the first lady’s
  scepticism with sharpening his partial rethink about Putin. At a meeting with
  the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on 15 July he said: “I go home. I tell
  the first lady: ‘I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful
  conversation.’ She said: ‘Oh really? Another city was just hit.’” At another
  White House event that same day, he said: “I’d get home, I’d say: ‘First lady,
  I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then
  I’ll turn on the television, or she’ll say to me one time: ‘Wow, that’s
  strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’ For more on the role Melania
  is playing in shaping her husband’s politics, read this in depth feature from
  the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour. We will continue to gather
  reaction and try to make sense of what happened in Anchorage, Alaska on
  Friday. In the meantime, here are some of the day’s developments so far:
  Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US
  military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three
  hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war
  in Ukraine. Ukrainian observers were horrified that Trump laid out a red
  carpet for Putin, and even applauded him. The meeting, billed as a summit,
  came to an end much earlier than scheduled, after the first of what was
  supposed to have been two rounds of talks. Reporters were summoned for what
  was billed as a joint news conference, but were instead treated to a pair of
  brief statements that lasted, in total, 12 minutes. After Putin claimed that
  some sort of agreement had been reached, Trump said that there had been ‘no
  deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no questions. A Fox News
  reporter called it “really stunning” that Putin spoke first in the event. In a
  post-summit interview with his supporter Sean Hannity, Trump said that the
  meeting with Putin had been “a 10” and suggested that Putin “spoke very
  sincerely” about his desire to end the war in Ukraine. Trump also claimed to
  Hannity that Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed
  political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him that the 2020
  US presidential election “was rigged” and “you can’t have an honest election
  with mail-in voting.’” Eleven months ago, during a presidential debate, Kamala
  Harris scoffed at Donald Trump’s claim that he would be able to end the war in
  Ukraine within 24 hours, based on his relationship with Vladimir Putin. After
  Trump claimed that he would get the war ended even before taking office, as
  president-elect, Harris shot back. “I believe the reason that Donald Trump
  says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give
  it up,” Harris said. “You would give up for the sake of favor and what you
  think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you
  for lunch”. In the end, when Trump did meet Putin as president on Friday,
  seven months into his second term, their discussion of ending the war went so
  badly that even the planned working lunch with the leaders and their aides was
  canceled. That meant that the Russians went home without tasting the filet
  mignon the president had planned to serve them, in sharp contrast to the last
  summit between the two presidents, in Helsinki in 2018, when lunch was served.
  A photograph of that 2018 lunch, taken by the New York Times photographer Doug
  Mills, is also a reminder of how different the make-up of Trump’s delegation
  was then. In 2018, Trump sat down to lunch with Putin flanked by: John Kelly,
  his chief of staff; Fiona Hill, his Russia adviser; Mike Pompeo, his secretary
  of state; Jon Huntsman, his ambassador to Russia; and John Bolton, his
  national security adviser. Every one of those former aides subsequently left
  Trump’s inner circle and openly denounced him. By contrast, Putin was joined
  at the 2018 lunch by: his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov; his foreign policy
  adviser, Yuri Ushakov; and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. All of them were at
  his side in Alaska on Friday. Donald Trump claimed in an interview with Sean
  Hannity on Friday that Vladimir Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed,
  exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told
  him at their summit meeting that the 2020 US presidential election “was
  rigged” through the widespread use of postal voting that year. “Vladimir Putin
  said something, one of the most interesting things, he said, ‘Your election
  was rigged because you have mail-in voting,’” Trump said. “He said, ‘No
  country has mail-in voting. It’s impossible to have mail-in voting and have
  honest elections.’” “We talked about 2020, he said: ‘You won that election by
  so much,’” Trump added. A short time later, after making the false claim that
  California’s system of sending ballots to voters opened the door to fraud,
  Trump said: “Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said ‘You can’t have an honest
  election with mail-in voting.’” There is no evidence that voter fraud played
  any role in Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, but elections in Putin’s Russia
  are notoriously dishonest, with rampant cheating by the authorities documented
  by pro-democracy activists. It is impossible to know if Putin did make these
  remarks, but Trump has a habit of putting his own words in the mouths of other
  people. In the interview, he also claimed that Putin told him that the US was
  “dead” under his predecessor, Joe Biden, and was now “as hot as a pistol”.
  Trump went on to repeat his claim that “the king of Saudi Arabia” told him the
  exact same thing in May, when he visited the country. But Trump did not meet
  the elderly king of Saudi Arabia during his visit. Asked by Sean Hannity what
  advice he would give to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy after meeting
  with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Donald Trump said he would tell him to “make a
  deal”, to end the war. He made no reference to any way in which Ukraine could
  make a deal with Russia while under occupation and bombardment. Trump also
  repeated his familiar lie, debunked by the Guardian six months ago, that the
  US had given $350bn to Ukraine for its defense, while Europe had given just
  $100bn. In an interview with Sean Hannity, recorded in the room where he just
  failed to convince Vladimir Putin to stop attacking Ukraine, Donald Trump just
  boasted that he has a special talent for ending wars. “Wars are very bad, I
  seem to have an ability to end them,” Trump said. The president was responding
  to a comment from Hannity, who praised Trump for playing a role in tamping
  down a series of largely dormant global conflicts in the past six months.
  Neither man mentioned that Trump had promised on the campaign trail that he
  would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if elected. Donald Trump’s
  post-summit interview with Sean Hannity is being broadcast now on Fox. Trump
  began by repeating his claim that he “always had a great relationship with
  President Putin”, but cooperation between the United States and Russia was
  made impossible by the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016
  election, which he refers to as a “hoax”. He then said that he did have a
  chance to speak privately to Putin, after their brief, 12-minute news
  conference. Putin “spoke very sincerely”, Trump said about his desire to end
  the war in Ukraine. Trump did not mention that the war began with Putin’s
  decision to seize Ukrainian territory in 2014, after his ally was deposed as
  president of Ukraine in a popular uprising. It then intensified in 2022 when
  Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Asked by Hannity to rate the
  meeting on a scale of one to 10, Trump replied that it was “a 10” because it
  showed that the leaders of the two nuclear-armed nations could cooperate.
  “It’s good when two big powers get along,” Trump said. Hannity then pressed
  Trump to reveal what Putin told him about why he thought the war in Ukraine
  would not have started if Trump was president. Trump demurred, but said that
  he could say in his own words that the reason was that Biden was grossly
  incompetent. At the end of Donald Trump’s brief and somewhat defeated-sounding
  remarks after his meeting with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president extended
  an invitation to his US counterpart to hold the next round of talks in the
  Russian capital. “Again, Mr President, I’d like to thank you very much, and
  we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon,” Trump
  said. “Thank you very much, Vladimir.” “Next time in Moscow,” Putin replied,
  chuckling. “Oh, that’s an interesting one,” Trump said. “I’ll get a little
  heat on that one, but I, uh, I could see it possibly happening.” On his way to
  Alaska, Donald Trump told Fox News anchor Bret Baier that his goal for the
  talks with Vladimir Putin was to get the Russian president to agree to a
  ceasefire. “So when you talk about deals, it’s all I do my whole life, I do
  deals, you never know, you don’t like to have too many expectations,” Trump
  told Baier in an interview recorded on Air Force One that was broadcast on
  Friday. “But we’re going to go and find out. I’d like to see a ceasefire. I
  wouldn’t be thrilled if I didn’t get it, but everyone says, ‘You’re not going
  to get the ceasefire, it’ll take place on the second meeting’, but I’m not
  going to be happy with that. “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some
  form of a ceasefire.” The White House pool reporter tells us that Donald Trump
  “is currently doing a previously announced interview with Sean Hannity of Fox
  News”. That interview, with an opinion host who is a strong supporter of the
  president and has campaigned for him, is scheduled to be broadcast on
  Hannity’s show in just over an hour. The interview was billed by the network
  as an exclusive look behind the scenes at what was supposed to have been a
  meeting of historic importance, perhaps comparable to Richard Nixon’s 1972
  visit to China to meet chairman Mao Zedong. At the very least, Trump said that
  he hoped to convince the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to agree to an
  immediate ceasefire in his war on Ukraine. Now that Trump’s talks with Putin
  have failed to bring the war in Ukraine to an end, a conflict that he promised
  on the campaign trail he could end in 24 hours, his discussion with Hannity
  will no doubt be a good deal less celebratory. Among those scrambling to make
  sense of the 12-minute news conference, at which no questions were taken
  before Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin departed, are Fox News producers and
  correspondents who had hyped this meeting between the presidents of the United
  States and Russia as a summit of historic proportions, and one at which they
  would have exclusive access. The network planned to broadcast an exclusive
  preview of the summit, recorded with Trump en route to Alaska on Air Force
  One, as the talks went on, to be followed by a second exclusive interview with
  the president, conducted by Sean Hannity immediately after the talks, to be
  broadcast during his 9pm show on Fox. Those carefully laid plans were thrown
  into chaos by the briefness of both the talk and the news conference. Jacqui
  Heinrich, a Fox White House correspondent, just noted in a live report from
  the conference room that what unfolded was very different from what Trump
  administration officials told reporters to expect. The idea, Heinrich said,
  was that there would be a news conference with the two leaders, and the
  opportunity to question them, if the talks went well, but if the talks did not
  go well, only Trump would appear and Putin would be sent packing. “Neither of
  those things happened,” Heinrich noted. “And what was really stunning to me,
  as someone who has been in a lot of these press conferences, is there were a
  few things that were very unusual. You had Putin come out and address the
  press first. We are on US soil here.” “The way that it felt in the room was
  not good,” Heinrich also said. “It did not seem like things went well. And it
  seemed like Putin came in and steamrolled, got right into what he wanted to
  say and got his photo next to the president and then left.” As Heinrich tried
  to make sense of what had taken place, the corner of the screen on Fox
  promoted Trump’s interview with Hannity, which is still scheduled to air at
  9pm ET. Putin also dominated the joint appearance in terms of speaking time.
  While the Russian leader spoke for about 8 minutes and 30 seconds, the US
  president was done in just under 3 minutes and 30 seconds. That was quick.
  Donald Trump left more questions than answers as he fawned over Vladimir Putin
  but gave precious few details about their high-stakes summit. “I believe we
  had a very productive meeting,” he said. “There were many, many points that we
  agreed on … There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call up Nato … I’ll
  of course call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting … We
  really made some great progress.” He added: “I’ve always had a fantastic
  relationship with President Putin – with Vladimir … We were interfered with by
  the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax.” Trump warmly thanked Putin, who invited
  him to Moscow, and dozens of reporters shouted questions but in vain. The US
  president, who can typically never resist talking and talking, left the stage
  without answering any of them. Donald Trump ended his brief remarks at the
  joint news conference by thanking Vladimir Putin, and saying that they would
  speak again soon. “Next time in Moscow,” Putin replied in English. Trump then
  called the news conference to an end without taking any questions from the
  assembled reporters, or offering any details of what Putin called the
  agreement they had reached in their three hours of talks. Donald Trump just
  began his very brief remarks by saying that the talks with Putin were
  “extremely productive” but more needs to be done to resolve the conflict in
  Ukraine. “I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many
  points that we agreed on,” Trump said. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal.
  I will call up Nato … I’ll of course call up President Zelensky and tell him
  about today’s meeting.” “We really made some great progress,” Trump said
  without revealing any details of what that progress was. “I’m going to start
  making a few phone calls and tell them what happened, but we had an extremely
  productive meeting and many points were agreed to,” Trump said. “There are
  just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant, one is probably
  the most significant. But we have a very good chance of getting there, we
  didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.” Donald
  Trump and Vladimir Putin have begun their joint press conference in Anchorage,
  Alaska, standing at lecterns against a blue backdrop that says “Pursuing
  peace”. Unusually, the visiting foreign leader went first. Speaking via
  Russian interpreter, Putin said he gave Trump a “neighbourly” greeting today
  because the US and Russia are neighbours and Alaska is a reminder of this. He
  acknowledged bilateral relations fell to the “lowest point since the cold
  war”. Putin described Trump’s efforts on Ukraine as “precious” and claimed
  “everything that’s happening is a tragedy for us and terrible wound”. Without
  giving details, Putin said today’s “agreement” could help Ukraine’s security
  and urged Europe to “not throw a wrench in the works” and “not use backroom
  dealings” to torpedo it. Putin says that he has reached an agreement with
  Trump and hopes that leaders in Kyiv “won’t throw a wrench” into the process
  of bring the war to an end. He offers no details on what the agreement is. He
  also repeated his frequent demand that the root causes of the conflict need to
  be addressed. In the past, Putin has suggested that those causes include the
  elected government of Ukraine, which he has falsely claimed is led by Nazis.
  Putin notes that Trump has claimed that the full-scale war that began with
  Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 would not have happened had Trump been
  the US president. Putin says that he agrees. Vladimir Putin is speaking first
  at the joint news conference in Alaska after his talks with Donald Trump
  wrapped up ahead of schedule. Putin said the talks were constructive before
  moving on to discuss the former Russian control of Alaska, noting the hundreds
  of Russian names of towns and numerous Russian Orthodox churches in the state.
  The Russian leader’s emphasis on the historical Russian “heritage” of the US
  state will not be comforting to Ukrainian listeners, given Putin’s claim that
  the entire country, which was once part of the Russian empire, should be
  considered part of the “Russian world”. “We have always considered the
  Ukrainian nation a brotherly nation,” Putin says. Donald Trump’s talks with
  Vladimir Putin on the war in Ukraine have concluded earlier than expected and
  a joint news conference with the two presidents is about to begin at a US
  military base in Anchorage, Alaska. We have live video from the room, and will
  bring you updates on their remarks here on the blog. The Russian foreign
  ministry reports on social media that the first round of talks between
  Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are over. Video posted on X by the ministry
  shows Putin walking away from the room and talking to his press secretary,
  Dmitry Peskov. The ministry says a joint news conference is expected to begin
  soon. The unexpectedly short talks have prompted speculation that the meeting
  did not go well. In advance of the summit, Trump did say: “I’ll know within
  the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes or five minutes. We tend to
  find out whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad meeting,
  and if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly”. Reporters have been called
  into the room set up for a joint news conference with Donald Trump and
  Vladimir Putin, my colleague David Smith reports from Anchorage. We will bring
  you updates here once the event begins, but the timing is a bit of a surprise,
  since Trump’s aide, Dan Scavino, posted on X less than an hour ago that the
  first of two planned meetings between the US and Russian delegations was still
  taking place. That session, in which the two leaders were joined by two
  foreign policy advisers, was to have been followed by a larger working lunch.
  As our colleague David Smith reported from Anchorage earlier, Donald Trump
  applauded Vladimir Putin, several times, when the two men met on a red carpet
  at the US airbase where they are now meeting in private with their top foreign
  policy advisers. The Kremlin Press Office quickly distributed a photograph of
  the US president clapping for “his Russian counterpart” to news agencies. The
  fact that the US president clapped for the Russian president and indicted war
  criminal, prompted the Russia-born cold war historian Sergey Radchenko to post
  a mind-blown emoji on X. “I argued in my book how the Russians crave nothing
  quite as much as recognition by the U.S.” he added. “Well, there we have it.
  There it is.” Trump’s three rounds of applause were captured on a live stream
  on the White House YouTube channel. But, a few minutes later, when the White
  House posted video of the greeting on social media, the clip was edited to
  begin a split-second after Trump finished his third round of applause for
  Putin. The video posted on the official White House Instagram and X accounts
  shows that Trump’s left arm is still swinging by his side as the clip begins.
  A look at the original live stream reveals that his arm had just dropped to
  his side at that point, after being raised in front of the president to clap
  for the Russian leader wanted by the International Criminal Court for the
  kidnapping of Ukrainian children. As Donald Trump hosts Vladimir Putin for
  talks in Alaska aimed at ending the Russian war on Ukraine, some Ukrainians
  watching from afar have noticed that the US literally rolled out a red carpet
  for the Russian president, who is an indicted war criminal charged with
  kidnapping Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied regions of their country.
  Mustafa Nayyem, a Ukrainian journalist turned politician, posted an image of
  US soldiers kneeling to secure the red carpet laid at the foot of Putin’s
  plane before the Russian president emerged with the caption: “Make Kneeling
  Great Again”. Nayyem, who helped organize the 2013 protest movement on Maidan,
  Kyiv’s Independence Square, that toppled Putin’s ally Viktor Yanukovych, was
  not alone. Olga Rudenko, the editor of the Kyiv Independent, shared the same
  image with the caption: “This is Putin’s new phone wallpaper. American
  soldiers kneeling under the big letters reading RUSSIA. To fix the red carpet.
  For a war criminal.” The Russian presidential jet is emblazoned with the word
  RUSSIA, written in Cyrillic letters. A Ukrainian soldier, Oleksandr Solonko,
  wrote: “I feel very sorry for the American military who were forced to roll
  out the red carpet for the greatest war criminal whose propaganda system has
  been smearing their country for many years.” The symbolism did not go
  unnoticed in Russia. Video of the US troops kneeling on the carpet beneath
  Putin’s plane was posted on Telegram by the Russian news channel Zvezda, or
  Star, which is owned by the Russian defense ministry. That clip was later
  shared on X by a German who supports Ukraine and compared Putin to Hitler.
  “Western media are on the verge of completely losing it”, Maria Zakharova, the
  Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, observed on social media. “They spent
  three years telling everyone Russia was isolated, and today they saw the
  beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US”. As Donald
  Trump and Vladimir Putin began their summit in Alaska centered on ending
  Russia’s war on Ukraine, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
  delivered an update on the fighting in a social media address from Kyiv. “On
  the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well. And that speaks
  volumes,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X accompanying his video update. He ran
  through a list of Russian targets. “Sumy – a Russian strike on the central
  market. Dnipro region – strikes on cities and enterprises. Zaporizhzhia,
  Kherson region, Donetsk region – deliberate Russian strikes. The war
  continues, and it is precisely because there is neither an order nor even a
  signal that Moscow is preparing to end this war,” Ukraine’s president said.
  “Russia must end the war that it itself started and has been dragging out for
  years,” he added. “The killings must stop. A meeting of leaders is needed – at
  the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side – and it is precisely
  in such a format that effective decisions are possible. Security guarantees
  are needed. Lasting peace is needed.” The summit between the two leaders and
  their respective cabinet officials began at 11.32am local time. We’re getting
  some pictures of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, joined by their respective
  delegations in a room ahead of their meeting. Behind the leaders is a blue
  backdrop that had the words “pursuing peace” printed on it. The White House
  press pool, who are travelling with the president, say that Trump and Putin
  were sat in place by 11.26am local time, and the press were ushered out of the
  room by 11.27am. Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and red tie, the US
  president descended the stairs from Air Force One at 11.08am local time and
  looked glum as he walked a red carpet. Trump came to a stop and, as Putin
  approached, applauded the Russian leader, then gave him a warm handshake and
  friendly tap on the arm. Putin appeared to crack a joke and both men smiled.
  The men walked together towards a platform bearing the sign: “Alaska 2025”
  Reporters shouted questions at Putin including, “Will you agree to a
  ceasefire?” and “Will you stop killing civilians?” Putin appeared to shrug.
  Putin then joined Trump in the presidential limousine ‘The Beast’ – a rare
  privilege for allies and adversaries alike – and could be seen laughing. Trump
  and Putin drove away in the US president’s official car, nicknamed “the
  Beast”. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin de-boarded their respective aircrafts,
  shook hands, and stood on a stage with “ALASKA 2025” emblazoned on the front,
  as the world’s press captured the moment. Russian state media is reporting
  that Vladimir Putin will be joined by his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and
  advisor Yuri Ushakov for his meeting with Donald Trump. It will now be a
  three-on-three summit, as the US president will be joined by secretary of
  state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Russian president Vladimir
  Putin has landed in Anchorage, according to Russian state media. The president
  has yet to deplane, but is currently greeting Alaska governor Muke Dunleavy
  and senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, all Republicans, aboard Air
  Force One, per the White House. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt
  also says that for the expanded bilateral meeting and lunch, Trump, Rubio, and
  Witkoff will be joined by treasury secretary Scott Bessent, commerce secretary
  Howard Lutnick, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House chief of staff
  Susie Wiles. As we wait for the president to deplane from Air Force One, it’s
  worth pointing out a nugget that my colleague, Jakub Krupa, reported earlier.
  Former Obama administration official and former managing editor of Time
  magazine, Richard Stengel, has objected to reports describing the Alaska
  summit as “high-stakes”, arguing on social media that it’s “a journalistic
  cliche” that “plays into Trump’s theatrical framing of the whole artificial
  made-for-TV ‘event’”. The city of Zaporizhzhia, an industrial hub in
  south-east Ukraine, is as good a place as any to grasp the stakes of freezing
  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine along its current frontlines, or of implementing
  a “land swap for peace” deal as envisioned by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump.
  Since Russian troops began rolling into Ukraine in February 2022,
  Zaporizhzhia, with its broad avenues and Stalin-era apartment blocks, has been
  a 30-minute drive from the frontline. It has been under near-constant attack
  from missiles and drones. On Sunday, a Russian guided air bomb hit a bus
  station, wounding 24 people – just another day of suffering in a city that has
  known many of them. Plenty of people here and in other Ukrainian towns close
  to the frontline are so weary of the sleepless nights and disrupted lives of
  the past years that they are ready for Kyiv to sign a peace deal, even an
  imperfect one, if it means the attacks will stop. But many others have a very
  different opinion because they know first-hand what it means to give Russia
  control over Ukrainian territory: arrests, disappearances and the erasure of
  anything Ukrainian. As Moscow moves swiftly to Russify occupied territory,
  expelling or arresting active members of society and introducing new media
  outlets and school curricula heavy on propaganda, a few years of Russian
  control may make it almost impossible for Ukraine to regain these territories
  at a later date. About one in five people living in Zaporizhzhia are
  internally displaced, from places even closer to the frontline or from
  occupied parts of Ukraine. They are living in Zaporizhzhia until they are able
  to go home. Read more about the grim reality of ‘land swaps’, and what it
  would mean for people in Zaporizhzhia. The previously planned sit-down between
  Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will now include the US secretary of state,
  Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the White House
  press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. Air Force One has touched down at Joint
  Base Elmendorf-Richardson ahead of Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin.
  Ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, has
  said that Britain stands with Ukraine on “what will be an important day for
  the future of Ukraine and Euro-Atlantic security”. Lammy said he had spoken to
  Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, and, in a post on social media,
  added: “I reiterated our enduring support and our commitment to work with the
  US and Ukraine to secure a just and lasting peace.” Greetings from Joint Base
  Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era military installation on the outskirts of
  Anchorage, that will play host to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin today. I am
  among an estimated 700 journalists from all over the world. We were greeted at
  Anchorage international airport by the sight of a majestic brown bear slain by
  Governor Mike Dunleavy and displayed as a trophy in a glass case. The media
  gathered downtown at 5.30am local time today and were bused to the air force
  base under a big sky with picturesque mountains. The airbase is like a small
  city with housing, children’s playgrounds, nondescript three-storey lodgings,
  a church with stained glass windows and great grassy expanses. The temperature
  is a crisp 50F. The Reuters news agency reported: “The Kremlin press pool was
  housed in an Alaska Airlines Center, where a semi-open-plan room was
  subdivided by partitions and some reporters were seen making their own
  camp-style beds. They were fed for free at a nearby university campus, Russian
  reporters said.” Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the
  Soviet Union during the cold war. It continues to play a role today, as planes
  from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into US
  airspace. Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in a sweatshirt
  with “CCCP” – the Russian letters for USSR – across the front. Today’s meeting
  could prove a win-win for the two leaders. Putin, an alleged war criminal who
  had been an international pariah, gets to meet the US president on American
  soil. Trump, for his part, gets to play global statesman in a massive media
  spectacle where no one is talking about Jeffrey Epstein. The plane
  transporting Russian government officials has landed in Anchorage, Alaska,
  according to Flightradar24. Welcome to our coverage of the US president’s
  summit with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. This will be the first
  meeting with the Kremlin leader of Trump’s second term in office – and his
  seventh in total. I’m Shrai Popat, and I’ll be bringing you the latest –
  alongside my colleagues – from today’s event. The summit is set to kick off in
  just over an hour (3pm ET), at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. To get you up
  to speed, this is where things stand at the moment: Donald Trump has said,
  repeatedly, over the last few days that his chief aim of today’s meeting is to
  get a trilateral summit between Putin, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and himself on the
  books. In his own words, Trump wants this to happen “almost immediately”. He’s
  also convinced that he’ll be able to tell from the first few minutes of his
  meeting today whether it will be a success, and would be prepared to walk away
  “real fast” if he thinks it’s not going well, according to an interview with
  Fox News. Crucially, the president has said he’s not in Alaska to negotiate on
  behalf of Ukraine, but instead with the goal of “getting Putin to the table”.
  However, Trump has been less clear on what would constitute a success from his
  sit-down with the Kremlin leader today. Earlier, on Air Force One, the
  president told reporters that he wants to see a ceasefire “rapidly”. He added:
  “I don’t know if it’s going to be today, but I’m not going to be happy if it’s
  not today.” The president also repeated his stern words from earlier in the
  week that Russia could expect “severe consequences” if it fails to show
  willingness to end the war in Ukraine. “Economically severe. It will be very
  severe. I’m not doing this for my health, OK, I don’t need it. I’d like to
  focus on our country, but I’m doing this to save a lot of lives,” the
  president said. For Zelenskyy’s part, he said that Ukraine is “counting on
  America”. He’s been shut out of talks today, but reiterated his call for “an
  honest end to the war”, and said he hoped to see “a strong American position”
  during today’s talks in Alaska. When it comes to territory negotiations, Trump
  has said he’s not interested in deciding on those today without Ukraine
  present, and Zelenskyy has said categorically that Ukraine could not agree to
  a ceasefire deal which cedes territory, as Moscow could use this as a
  springboard to start a future war. Trump confirmed to Zelenskyy that he’ll be
  calling him first after today’s meeting wraps, and he’s set to brief European
  leaders after that debrief. Ahead of the today’s summit, the president posted
  on Truth Social that he had a “wonderful” call with the Belarusian president,
  Alexander Lukashenko, saying “the purpose of the call was to thank him for the
  release of 16 prisoners”, with 1,300 under discussion. The Belarussian leader
  is the country’s only president since it adopted its current constitution.
  Lukashenko has described himself as Europe’s “last and only dictator”, and is
  a notable Russian ally.

It is almost 6.30pm in Kyiv and Moscow. We will be closing this blog soon, but you can stay up to date on the Guardian’s Russia-Ukraine war coverage here. Here’s a recap of the developments from today: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet president Trump in Washington on Monday after Trumps’s summit with Putin resulted in no ceasefire deal. The US and Russian leaders met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Regarding the upcoming meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump wrote in a post on social media platform Truth Social that, “If it all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin. Potentially, millions of people’s lives will be saved.” Trump publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire he had himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin’s preferred path of pushing through a far-reaching “Peace Agreement” before halting any fighting. “Unfortunately, Trump has taken Putin’s position, and this was Putin’s demand,” Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told Reuters on Saturday. Speaking to German public broadcaster ZDF, chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Saturday that the United States was ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen also said in a post on X that strong security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe were “essential” in any peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. Trump’s debriefing to European leaders after the Alaska summit with Putin included discussions about security guarantees for Ukraine, which is outside Nato. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the guarantees would be equivalent to article 5, which states that if a Nato ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this as an armed attack against all members. Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said that the discussion of security guarantees was area where “most interesting developments” happened during the Trump-Putin Alaska summit. After a debriefing from president Trump, the European Commission released a joint pledge to back Ukraine, emphasising that “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome President Trump’s statement that the US is prepared to give security guarantees. The coalition of the willing is ready to play an active role. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato. It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.” Several European leaders lauded Trump’s efforts to end the war in Ukraine. UK prime minister Keir Starmer said in a statement: “President Trump’s efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended.” The Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavský said he was “glad that President Trump is trying to stop the war” but that there has been “propagandistic nonsense about the ‘roots of the conflict’” from Putin in the subsequent press conference. European leaders have been invited to attend the Monday meeting with US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, the New York Times reported on Saturday, citing two senior European officials. During the Alaska meeting, Putin told Trump that he would freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in exchange for the Donetsk region of Ukraine, according to a Financial Times report. In a statement posted on the social media platform X earlier on Saturday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine.” Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned that Russia may step up its attacks on Ukraine following the inconclusive Putin-Trump summit and the news that the Ukrainian leader would fly to Washington to meet the US president on Monday. Two people were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russia’s Kursk region, the local governor said on Saturday. A blast at a factory in the Russian region of Ryazan on Friday killed 11 people and left 130 injured, Russia’s emergencies ministry said on Saturday. Some Russian media outlets reported that the explosion was caused by gunpowder catching fire. The Russian defence ministry said its forces had taken Kolodyazi village in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to state media reports on Saturday. The Guardian could not independently verify battlefield reports. Trump reportedly hand-delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in Ukraine – for which Putin is wanted by the international criminal court – White House officials said, without providing further details. The United States is ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine, German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said on Saturday after a summit in Alaska between the US president, Donald Trump, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ended without a ceasefire deal. Merz was speaking to the German public broadcaster ZDF after being briefed together with other European leaders by Trump on his talks with Putin. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told Donald Trump that he would freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in exchange for the Donetsk region of Ukraine, the Financial Times reports. The Russian leader made the request during his meeting with Trump in Alaska on Friday, the FT said, citing four people with direct knowledge of the talks. In a statement posted on the social media platform X earlier on Saturday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided without Ukraine.” Trump sent another fundraising email to supporters where he mentioned meeting with Putin in Alaska on Saturday, according to NBC News reports. “I met with Putin in Alaska yesterday! After my meeting with him, I need you to answer just one question … Do you still stand with Donald Trump?” the email said. This comes after Trump’s campaign sent an email seeking donations on Friday, ahead of the Alaska summit. Yesterday’s email read, “I’m meeting with Putin in Alaska! It’s a little chilly. THIS MEETING IS VERY HIGH STAKES for the world. The Democrats would love nothing more than for ME TO FAIL. No one in the world knows how to make deals like me!” European leaders are invited to attend a Monday meeting with US president Donald Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House, the New York Times reported on Saturday, citing two senior European officials. The meeting comes after a summit between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, which Washington said resulted in “great progress” but no deal to end the conflict in Ukraine. Two people, a 52-year-old man and his 13-year-old son, were killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on Russia’s Kursk region, the local governor said on Saturday. In a statement published on Telegram, the Kursk governor, Alexander Khinshtein, said that the two had been killed when their car caught fire as a result of a drone strike. Khinshtein said that the attack took place in Rylsk district, a border area close to the part of Kursk region that Ukraine occupied between August 2024 and March this year. Here are the latest photos coming in: The “coalition of the willing” leaders will meet via video conference on Sunday afternoon ahead of president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington on Monday, the French presidency office said on Saturday. The meeting will be co-presided by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the office said. Poland’s prime minister, Donald Tusk, has warned that the battle for Ukraine’s future and European security has reached a “decisive phase” as he urged the west to maintain unity in its opposition to Vladimir Putin, who he labelled a “cunning and ruthless player”. The game for Ukraine’s future, Poland’s security, and all of Europe has entered a decisive phase. Today, it is even clearer that Russia respects only the strong, and Putin has once again proven to be a cunning and ruthless player. Therefore, maintaining the unity of the entire West is so important. Earlier this week, US president Donald Trump at the last minute requested Maga-allied Polish president Karol Nawrocki join the Ukraine teleconference with European leaders on Wednesday, according to centrist Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, who had initally been expected to attend. Nawrocki, not Tusk, was present on the call between Trump and European leaders on Friday night after the summit with Putin in Alaska. Nawrocki, a conservative nationalist and Eurosceptic, is an ally of Trump’s right-wing populist Maga political movement and visited the White House during Poland’s presidential election campaign this year. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that Russia may step up its attacks on Ukraine following the inconclusive Putin-Trump summit and the news that the Ukrainian leader would fly to Washington to meet the US president on Monday. In a post on X, he wrote: Based on the political and diplomatic situation around Ukraine, and knowing Russia’s treachery, we anticipate that in the coming days the Russian army may try to increase pressure and strikes against Ukrainian positions in order to create more favorable political circumstances for talks with global actors. Agence France-Presse has been speaking to some ordinary Ukrainians to get their view of the summit, and it’s fair to say they are pretty unimpressed. Pavlo Nebroev stayed up until the middle of the night in Kharkiv, which has suffered repeated Russian bombardments, to wait for the press conference. The 38-year-old theatre manager said: I saw the results I expected. I think this is a great diplomatic victory for Putin. He has completely legitimised himself.” Nebroev, like many Ukrainians, was gobsmacked the meeting could take place without representatives of his country. This was a useless meeting. Issues concerning Ukraine should be resolved with Ukraine, with the participation of Ukrainians, the president.” Olya Donik, 36, said she was not surprised by the turn of events as she walked through a sunny park in Kharkiv with Nebroev. “It ended with nothing. Alright, let’s continue living our lives here in Ukraine,” she said. “Whether there are talks or not, Kharkiv is being shelled almost every day. Kharkiv definitely doesn’t feel any change,” said Iryna Derkach, a 50-year-old photographer. We believe in victory, we know it will come, but God only knows who exactly will bring it about”. Derkach, like many Ukrainians, was suspicious of Trump. “We do our job and don’t pay too much attention to what Trump is doing,” she added. Pharmacist Larysa Melnyk did not think her country was any closer to seeing peace. “I don’t think there will be a truce,” she told AFP, adding that even if the guns fall silent, it will only be temporarily. Russia’s reaction to Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has been nothing short of jubilant, with Moscow celebrating the fact that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s ceasefire demands. “The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without preconditions,” wrote former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram. He added that the summit showed that talks could continue as Russia wages war in Ukraine. Trump entered the high-stakes summit warning, “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe consequences” if Moscow refused to cooperate. But after a three-hour meeting with the Russian side that yielded no tangible results, Trump shelved his threats and instead insisted that the meeting was “extremely productive,” even as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for ending the war and announced no concessions on the battlefield, where Russian forces are consolidating key gains in eastern Ukraine. Read the full article here: The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a post on X that strong security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe were “essential” in any peace deal to end the war in Ukraine. “The EU is working closely with Zelenskyy and the United States to reach a just and lasting peace. Strong security guarantees that protect Ukrainian and European vital security interests are essential,” von der Leyen posted on Saturday. The EU leaders are emphasising the issue of security guarantees, something Ukraine has been seeking as the minimum feature to secure its future ability to defend itself in the absence of membership of Nato, which is still wants. More statements have been issued after the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska ended in no peace agreement. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement on Saturday that Russia has no intention of ending its war in Ukraine “anytime soon” but that the US “holds the power to force Russia to negotiate seriously”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a statement on X that France would work with the US and partners in the “coalition of the willing” to make progress on a lasting peace with security guarantees. That coalition will meet in the near future, Macron added. The spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, Randhir Jaiswal, said on Saturday: “The way forward can only be through dialogue and diplomacy. The world wants to see an early end to the conflict in Ukraine.” The Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, who has diverged from most western allies by visiting Moscow twice since last year and refusing to provide official military aid to Ukraine, said in a recorded statement on Facebook: “The coming days will show whether the big players in the Union will support this process … or whether the unsuccessful European strategy of trying to weaken Russia through this conflict with all kinds of literally incredible financial, political or military assistance to Kyiv will continue.” In a statement posted on the social media platform X, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said: “Security must be guaranteed reliably and in the long term, with the involvement of both Europe and the US. “All issues important to Ukraine must be discussed with Ukraine’s participation, and no issue, particularly territorial ones, can be decided witout Ukraine.” He said that Ukraine needed a real, long-lasting peace and not “just another pause” between Russian invasions, and stressed to Trump during their call that sanctions should be strengthened. The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, has said that the discussion of security guarantees was area where “most interesting developments” happened during the Trump-Putin Alaska summit, Reuters reported on Saturday. Meloni also said that Trump has followed the Italian idea of security guarantees “inspired by Nato’s article 5”. In Trump’s debriefing to European leaders after the Alaska summit with Putin, there were discussions about security guarantees for Ukraine, which is outside Nato. A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the guarantees would be equivalent to article 5, which states that if a Nato ally is the victim of an armed attack, each and every other member of the Alliance will consider this as an armed attack against all members. In a joint statement published earlier today, the European Council said: “No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato.” A senior Ukrainian parliamentarian said on Saturday that by proposing to abandon a ceasefire agreement in favour of a peace agreement, Trump is taking Vladimir Putin’s position. “Unfortunately, Trump has taken Putin’s position, and this was Putin’s demand,” Oleksandr Merezhko, the head of the Ukrainian parliament’s foreign affairs committee, told Reuters. “In Putin’s view, a peace agreement means several dangerous things – Ukraine not joining Nato, his absurd demands for denazification and demilitarisation, the Russian language and the Russian church,” he said. The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, has released an official statement on Ukraine after the Alaska summit held between president Trump and president Putin. The statement said: “President Trump’s efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended.” It echoed the joint statement released by the European Council by reiterating: “the next step must be further talks involving President Zelenskyy. The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him.” Starmer continued: “This morning, I spoke to President Zelenskyy, President Trump and other European partners, and we all stand ready to support this next phase. I welcome the openness of the United States, alongside Europe, to provide robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any deal. This is important progress and will be crucial in deterring Putin from coming back for more. In the meantime, until he stops his barbaric assault, we will keep tightening the screws on his war machine with even more sanctions, which have already had a punishing impact on the Russian economy and its people. Our unwavering support for Ukraine will continue as long as it takes.” The European Council have released a joint statement by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, the Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, the Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, António Costa and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. The statement, in response to Trump’s meeting with Putin in Alaska which secured no peace agreement, said: “Leaders welcomed President Trump’s efforts to stop the killing in Ukraine, end Russia’s war of aggression, and achieve just and lasting peace. As President Trump said ‘there’s no deal until there’s a deal’. As envisioned by President Trump, the next step must now be further talks including President Zelenskyy, whom he will meet soon. We are also ready to work with President Trump and President Zelenskyy towards a trilateral summit with European support.” The statement emphasised that “Ukraine must have ironclad security guarantees to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. We welcome President Trump’s statement that the US is prepared to give security guarantees. The coalition of the willing is ready to play an active role. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine’s armed forces or on its cooperation with third countries. Russia cannot have a veto against Ukraine’s pathway to EU and Nato. It will be up to Ukraine to make decisions on its territory. International borders must not be changed by force.” It added: “Our support to Ukraine will continue. We are determined to do more to keep Ukraine strong in order to achieve an end to the fighting and a just and lasting peace. As long as the killing in Ukraine continues, we stand ready to uphold the pressure on Russia. We will continue to strengthen sanctions and wider economic measures to put pressure on Russia’s war economy until there is a just and lasting peace. Ukraine can count on our unwavering solidarity as we work towards a peace that safeguards Ukraine’s and Europe’s vital security interests.” European leaders are to release a joint statement after discussing Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin on Friday. The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, wrote on X: “The conversation among European leaders evaluating the information provided by President Trump and the outcomes of the Alaska meeting has concluded.” He added: “Together with @EmmanuelMacron, @—FriedrichMerz, @Keir—Starmer, @GiorgiaMeloni, we listened to the opinions of @ZelenskyyUa and prepared a joint statement.” He did not say when the statement would be made public. The Russian defence ministry has said its forces have taken Kolodyazi village in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, according to state media reports on Saturday. Russian state media also reported that forces have taken Vorone village in the neighbouring Dnipropetrovsk region of Ukraine. The Guardian could not independently verify battlefield reports. President Donald Trump has said that Ukrainian president Zelenskyy will be coming to the DC Oval Office on Monday afternoon, Reuters reports. The report added that “if it all works out”, Trump intends to “schedule a meeting with president Putin”. According to Reuters, Trump has said during the Alaska summit it was determined that the best way to end the war in Ukraine is “to go directly to a peace deal, not ceasefire”. We will have more on this as the story develops. There has been speculation on the social media platform X about an air ceasefire, according to reports from Oliver Carroll, a foreign correspondent for the Economist. Carroll said on Saturday: “I’m told there is provisional agreement of an air ceasefire until 3-way leaders meeting. ‘We think the skies will give signals about provisional results of these talks,’ source tells me. ‘The next week will be interesting.’” Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communication adviser Dmytro Lytvyn responded to the post, writing: “We haven’t heard anything about it yet”. There have been no reports of a ceasefire deal from Washington or Moscow. During what was billed as a joint news conference after the Alaska summit, Putin claimed that some sort of agreement had been reached, but Trump said that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no questions. A blast at a factory in the Russian region of Ryazan on Friday killed 11 people and left 130 injured, Russia’s emergencies ministry said on Saturday. In a statement on Telegram, the ministry said rescuers were continuing to search through rubble at the scene of the blast, 200 miles (320km) south-east of Moscow. The Ryazan regional governor, Pavel Malkov, said on Friday that the incident had been triggered by a fire breaking out inside a workshop at the factory. There was no cause given for the fire, not was it clear what the factory produced. Ukrainian drones have previously targeted military and economic infrastructure in Ryazan region. In January, a major oil refinery and power station had been hit by Ukrainian drones. Some Russian media outlets reported that the explosion was caused by gunpowder catching fire. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke on the phone with Donald Trump and European partners on Saturday morning after the meeting between Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the Élysée office said in a statement on Saturday. The phone conversation lasted for one hour and other there were seven other European leaders present, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Friedrich Merz, Keir Starmer, Giorgia Meloni, Alexander Stubb and Karol Nawrocki, as well as the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, the statement said. We are yet to hear from Sir Keir Starmer’s government, but other European politicians have been reacting. Italy’s deputy PM, Matteo Salvini said: “Every step forward towards peace, like this one, is good news. As Pope Leo said, may diplomacy speak again in place of weapons, without anyone obstructing it.” The Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, said: “President Putin of Russia reiterated known arguments, such as emphasising the so-called ‘root causes’ of the war, which is code for the Russian justification for the illegal invasion of Ukraine.” He added it was important to keep pressure on Russia and listen to Ukraine’s wishes and needs. The Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavský said he was “glad that President Trump is trying to stop the war” but that there has been “propagandistic nonsense about the ‘roots of the conflict’” from Putin in the subsequent press conference. “The problem is Russian imperialism, not Ukraine’s desire to live freely,” he continued. “If Putin were serious about negotiating peace, he would not have been attacking Ukraine all day today.” Lithuania’s defence minister, Dovilė Šakalienė, accused Putin of making “some more gaslighting and veiled threats” towards Ukraine and Europe in the press conference, in which the Russian leader said he hoped the countries “will not try to sabotage the talks”. Hungary’s PM, Viktor Orbán, wrote on Facebook: “For years, we have watched the two largest nuclear powers eliminate the framework of their cooperation and send messages to each other.” He added “It’s over now. The world is a safer place today than it was yesterday.” President Trump told Zelenskyy and Nato leaders that Putin doesn’t want a ceasefire and prefers a comprehensive agreement to end the war, the Axios reporter Barak Ravid posted on X. The post added that Trump has said: “I think a fast peace deal is better than a ceasefire.” Russia’s initial reaction to the Donald Trump-Vladimir Putin summit has been decisively positive, with Moscow highlighting that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s ceasefire demands. “The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without preconditions and simultaneously with the continuation of the ‘special military operation’,” wrote the former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram, using Russia’s preferred term for its invasion of Ukraine. Medvedev, now the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, welcomed the fact that Putin was able to “personally and in detail present” Russia’s maximalist conditions for ending the war. In Alaska, Putin repeated his familiar line that the “root causes” of the conflict must be addressed – demands that in practice would severely limit Ukraine’s sovereignty. He also picked up on Trump’s remarks that the pressure now lies with Kyiv, indirectly referring to the US president’s blunt message that Zelenskyy “gotta make a deal”. “Both sides directly placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on ending military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev wrote. Russian state media and the Kremlin elite were already in high spirits as Trump rolled out the red carpet for Putin, who is wanted by The Hague for war crimes. “Western media are on the verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova as Putin landed in Alaska. “For three years they told everyone Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US,” she added. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that he plans to meet Trump in Washington on Monday after Trumps’s summit with Putin. “Ukraine reaffirms its readiness to work with maximum effort to achieve peace,” Zelenskyy said on X on Saturday. “We support President Trump’s proposal for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the USA, and Russia. Ukraine emphasises that key issues can be discussed at the level of leaders, and a trilateral format is suitable for this,” he added. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is planning to meet Donald Trump in Washington as soon as Monday, the Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on X on Saturday. Zelenskyy has said that his call with Trump lasted more than an hour and a half, and that Ukraine supports trilateral meetings. He added that Europe should be part of these talks at all stages. For those joining us now, here’s what you might have missed. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian observers were horrified that Trump laid out a red carpet for Putin, and even applauded him. The meeting, billed as a summit, came to an end much earlier than scheduled, after the first of what was supposed to have been two rounds of talks. Reporters were summoned for what was billed as a joint news conference, but were instead treated to a pair of brief statements that lasted, in total, 12 minutes. After Putin claimed that some sort of agreement had been reached, Trump said that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no questions. The White House said Trump has had a “lengthy” call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Nato leaders, on the plane after the meeting before he returned to DC. The meeting was criticised by Democrats, some European officials, Ukrainian media outlets, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, and the former US national security advisor, John Bolton, who said “Putin clearly won”. A Fox News reporter called it “really stunning” that Putin spoke first in the event. In a post-summit interview with his supporter Sean Hannity, Trump said that the meeting with Putin had been “a 10” and suggested that Putin “spoke very sincerely” about his desire to end the war in Ukraine. Trump also claimed to Hannity that Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him that the 2020 US presidential election “was rigged” and “you can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting.’” Trump reportedly hand-delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in Ukraine – for which Putin is wanted by the international criminal court – White House officials said, without providing further details. Overnight, Russia launched 85 attack drones and a ballistic missile targeting Ukraine’s territory, Ukraine’s air force said. Few in Ukraine are surprised at the apparent lack of outcome in the Alaska summit. There was little to no expectation of progress towards a ceasefire, never mind an actual cessation of hostilities, given Putin’s long history of aggression and intransigence towards the country. Though Trump said that the leaders had a “very productive meeting”, the look on his face suggested otherwise. Critical for Ukraine’s leadership today will be to understand if Putin’s maximalist negotiating position has adjusted at all - and how the US leader responded to the demands of his Russian counterpart. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said repeatedly that he did not believe that Putin was a good faith negotiator and has expressed the belief that Donald Trump would eventually conclude the same for himself. The hope in Kyiv will now be that Trump can be gently steered towards closer support for Ukraine and consider moving forward with measures such as secondary sanctions on Russia oil exports. But there is also a grim anxiety. Russian missile and drone attacks into Ukraine have been reduced in the days running up to the summit. Now the meeting is over, the fear is that a return to large scale night time assaults could follow. Vladimir Putin remains determined to “revive the Soviet Union” by “destroying democracy next door”, Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, has said. Speaking to Australia’s national broadcaster, in the wake of the meeting, Myroshnychenko pushed back on Putin’s rhetoric about needing to solve the “root causes” of the conflict. He said the root cause of the conflict from Putin’s perspective was a sovereign, independent and democratic Ukraine. “When Putin talks about the ‘root cause of war’, it’s an independent Ukraine on the map of Europe. That’s the only cause of war for Russia,” he said. “Putin is just out there on his mission to revive the Soviet Union, to revive the Russian empire, and it can’t be revived without Ukraine. Just overnight, as we speak, Russians have attacked many Ukrainian cities, sent many drones. So we don’t really see any indication of him ending his war.” Read more here: The Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov says there was no discussion of a three-way summit between the Russian, US and Ukrainian presidents, the Russian state news agency Tass reported. After the meeting, Trump had told reporters it was now up to Zelenskyy to “get it done” and that a meeting would be set up between the Ukrainian president and Putin, which Trump might attend. Ushakov said he did not know yet when Putin and Trump would meet again after Friday’s summit in Alaska. More reaction from Europe to the meeting: the Czech defence minister, Jana Černochová, has said the summit showed that the Russian president is not looking for peace and wants to weaken western unity. “The Trump-Putin talks in Alaska did not bring significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, but they confirmed that Putin is not seeking peace, but rather an opportunity to weaken western unity and spread his propaganda,” she wrote on X, adding that the west must continue supporting Ukraine. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has told reporters that Trump had a “lengthy” call with Ukrainian president Zelenskyy on the plane back to DC, and is now on the phone to Nato leaders, according to wire agencies and reporters in the White House pool. There are no further details just yet. The Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, has accused Trump of rolling out the red carpet “for an authoritarian thug” in what was “just theatre”, not diplomacy. “Instead of standing with Ukraine and our allies, Trump stood shoulder to shoulder with an autocrat that has terrorised the Ukrainian people and the globe for years,” Schumer said in a statement. “While we wait for critical details of what was discussed- on first take it appears Trump handed Putin legitimacy, a global stage, zero accountability, and got nothing in return.” Schumer has been joined by other Democrats in criticising the meeting. Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Donald Trump has been cozying up to Vladimir Putin for years, and this meeting underscored the depth of his sick obsession with the Russian dictator and accused war criminal.” He added: “Trump has been clear that his foreign policy agenda is letting Russia ‘do whatever the hell they want’ – no matter how disastrous for the US and our allies – and when put to the test, Trump embarrassed the United States by folding like a cheap suit.” Meanwhile Democrat senator Mark Kelly told Trump he should “ink the deal first”. Norway’s foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, says it is too early to tell if the meeting resulted in any progress. “We must continue to put pressure on Russia, and even increase it, to give the clear signal to Russia that it must pay the price [for its invasion of Ukraine],” Eide told reporters in Oslo. Earlier this month Eide had said on X that he welcomed Trump’s “initiative to bring Russia’s illegal war to an end”. But had added: “Nobody wants peace more than Ukraine. A dignified peace must be a lasting and just peace. No decision about Ukraine should be made without Ukraine. Its sovereignty &amp; territorial integrity must be respected.” As Trump and Putin met in Alaska, Russia launched 85 attack drones and a ballistic missile targeting Ukraine’s territory, Ukraine’s Air Force said on Saturday. Frontline territories in the Sumy, Donetsk, Chernihiv, and Dnipropetrovsk regions were targeted in the overnight strikes, the air force said on the Telegram messaging app. It said its air defence units destroyed 61 of the drones. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said in its daily morning report that 139 clashes had taken place on the front line over the past day. Meanwhile Russian media, citing the country’s defence ministry, said Russia’s air defence systems intercepted and destroyed 29 Ukrainian drones overnight over various Russian regions, including 10 downed over the Rostov region. David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, has been in Anchorage for the meeting, which provided quite a bit of material for his political sketch: That was the moment he knew it was true love. Donald Trump turned to gaze at Vladimir Putin as the Russian president publicly endorsed his view that, had Trump been president instead of Joe Biden, the war in Ukraine would never have happened. “Today President Trump was saying that if he was president back then, there would be no war, and I’m quite sure that it would indeed be so,” Putin said. “I can confirm that.” Vladimir, you complete me, Trump might have replied. To hell with all those Democrats, democrats, wokesters, fake news reporters and factcheckers. Here is a man who speaks my authoritarian alternative facts language. The damned doubters had been worried about Friday’s big summit at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era airbase under a big sky and picturesque mountains on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska. They feared that it might resemble Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Adolf Hitler in Munich 1938, or Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin carving up the world for the great powers at the Yalta Conference in 1945. It was worse than that. You can read Smith’s full dispatch here. “Sickening. Shameful. And in the end, useless.” The Kyiv Independent has published a blistering editorial on the Trump Putin meeting. Trump didn’t get what he wanted. But Putin? He sure did. From the moment he stepped off the plane on US soil, the Russian dictator was beaming. No longer an international pariah, he was finally getting accepted – and respected — by the leader of the free world. Trump’s predecessor once called Putin a murderer; Trump offered him a king’s welcome. The English-language Ukrainian outlet’s editorial compared the “king’s welcome” for Putin to Trump’s hostile reception of Zelenskyy in the Oval Office just six months ago. “Ukraine’s president endured a public shaming. Russia’s was pampered. Both episodes were disgraceful,” it said. “Trump fails to grasp that Putin isn’t transactional about Ukraine – he is messianic. He wants Ukraine for Russia, period. For Putin and his inner circle, Ukraine’s independence is an accident, and they are correcting it.” “Trump did not lose, but Putin clearly won,” former US ambassador to the UN and national security adviser John Bolton has told CNN. “Trump didn’t come away with anything except more meetings. Putin has, I think, gone a long way to reestablishing the relationship, which I’ve always believed is his key goal. He has escaped sanctions, he’s not facing a ceasefire, the next meeting is not set, [Ukrainian president] Zelenskyy was not told any of this before this press conference. It’s far from over but I’d say Putin achieved most of what he wanted and Trump achieved very little.” “And I would say one other thing. Trump looked very tired up there,” Bolton added. “Not disappointed, tired. And we’ll have to reflect on what that means.” The Trump-Putin meeting drew some crowds of onlookers Anchorage. Protesters unveiled a massive Ukrainian flag, in support of the country that Putin invaded in 2022 and has waged war on since. Elsewhere, Trump supporters gathered by the roadside to welcome the US president. While in Alaska, Putin made a couple of side visits, according to Russia’s foreign ministry. He laid flowers at the graves of Soviet soldiers At the Fort Richardson Memorial Cemetery he laid flowers at the graves of Soviet pilots and sailors who died during the second world war. He also met with Archbishop Alexei, of the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Alaska, perhaps an attempt to remind people that Alaska used to be part of Russia. Trump hand delivered a letter from his wife, Melania, to Putin at the meeting, White House officials have told Reuters. The letter raised the plight of children abducted during the war in Ukraine, they said, without providing further details. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian children have been abducted, taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territories without the consent of families or guardians, which Ukraine has called a war crime that meets the UN treaty definition of genocide. Putin has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for the alleged war crime of unlawful deportation and transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. “There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Putin bears individual criminal responsibility,” the charge says. Moscow has previous said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone. Melania Trump was not on the Alaska trip, however she is emerging as one of the strongest influences on her husband, whose inner circle tends to shift as people fall in and out of favour. Trump has credited the first lady’s scepticism with sharpening his partial rethink about Putin. At a meeting with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on 15 July he said: “I go home. I tell the first lady: ‘I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.’ She said: ‘Oh really? Another city was just hit.’” At another White House event that same day, he said: “I’d get home, I’d say: ‘First lady, I had the most wonderful talk with Vladimir. I think we’re finished.’ And then I’ll turn on the television, or she’ll say to me one time: ‘Wow, that’s strange because they just bombed a nursing home.’ For more on the role Melania is playing in shaping her husband’s politics, read this in depth feature from the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour. We will continue to gather reaction and try to make sense of what happened in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday. In the meantime, here are some of the day’s developments so far: Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin met on a red carpet laid down for them at a US military base in the former Russian territory of Alaska, and spent about three hours in private talks, with top foreign policy aides, aimed at ending the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian observers were horrified that Trump laid out a red carpet for Putin, and even applauded him. The meeting, billed as a summit, came to an end much earlier than scheduled, after the first of what was supposed to have been two rounds of talks. Reporters were summoned for what was billed as a joint news conference, but were instead treated to a pair of brief statements that lasted, in total, 12 minutes. After Putin claimed that some sort of agreement had been reached, Trump said that there had been ‘no deal’ and then abruptly ended the event, taking no questions. A Fox News reporter called it “really stunning” that Putin spoke first in the event. In a post-summit interview with his supporter Sean Hannity, Trump said that the meeting with Putin had been “a 10” and suggested that Putin “spoke very sincerely” about his desire to end the war in Ukraine. Trump also claimed to Hannity that Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him that the 2020 US presidential election “was rigged” and “you can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting.’” Eleven months ago, during a presidential debate, Kamala Harris scoffed at Donald Trump’s claim that he would be able to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, based on his relationship with Vladimir Putin. After Trump claimed that he would get the war ended even before taking office, as president-elect, Harris shot back. “I believe the reason that Donald Trump says that this war would be over within 24 hours is because he would just give it up,” Harris said. “You would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch”. In the end, when Trump did meet Putin as president on Friday, seven months into his second term, their discussion of ending the war went so badly that even the planned working lunch with the leaders and their aides was canceled. That meant that the Russians went home without tasting the filet mignon the president had planned to serve them, in sharp contrast to the last summit between the two presidents, in Helsinki in 2018, when lunch was served. A photograph of that 2018 lunch, taken by the New York Times photographer Doug Mills, is also a reminder of how different the make-up of Trump’s delegation was then. In 2018, Trump sat down to lunch with Putin flanked by: John Kelly, his chief of staff; Fiona Hill, his Russia adviser; Mike Pompeo, his secretary of state; Jon Huntsman, his ambassador to Russia; and John Bolton, his national security adviser. Every one of those former aides subsequently left Trump’s inner circle and openly denounced him. By contrast, Putin was joined at the 2018 lunch by: his foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov; his foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov; and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov. All of them were at his side in Alaska on Friday. Donald Trump claimed in an interview with Sean Hannity on Friday that Vladimir Putin, the Russian autocrat who has jailed, exiled and killed political rivals who could challenge him in elections, told him at their summit meeting that the 2020 US presidential election “was rigged” through the widespread use of postal voting that year. “Vladimir Putin said something, one of the most interesting things, he said, ‘Your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting,’” Trump said. “He said, ‘No country has mail-in voting. It’s impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.’” “We talked about 2020, he said: ‘You won that election by so much,’” Trump added. A short time later, after making the false claim that California’s system of sending ballots to voters opened the door to fraud, Trump said: “Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said ‘You can’t have an honest election with mail-in voting.’” There is no evidence that voter fraud played any role in Trump’s loss in the 2020 election, but elections in Putin’s Russia are notoriously dishonest, with rampant cheating by the authorities documented by pro-democracy activists. It is impossible to know if Putin did make these remarks, but Trump has a habit of putting his own words in the mouths of other people. In the interview, he also claimed that Putin told him that the US was “dead” under his predecessor, Joe Biden, and was now “as hot as a pistol”. Trump went on to repeat his claim that “the king of Saudi Arabia” told him the exact same thing in May, when he visited the country. But Trump did not meet the elderly king of Saudi Arabia during his visit. Asked by Sean Hannity what advice he would give to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy after meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, Donald Trump said he would tell him to “make a deal”, to end the war. He made no reference to any way in which Ukraine could make a deal with Russia while under occupation and bombardment. Trump also repeated his familiar lie, debunked by the Guardian six months ago, that the US had given $350bn to Ukraine for its defense, while Europe had given just $100bn. In an interview with Sean Hannity, recorded in the room where he just failed to convince Vladimir Putin to stop attacking Ukraine, Donald Trump just boasted that he has a special talent for ending wars. “Wars are very bad, I seem to have an ability to end them,” Trump said. The president was responding to a comment from Hannity, who praised Trump for playing a role in tamping down a series of largely dormant global conflicts in the past six months. Neither man mentioned that Trump had promised on the campaign trail that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours if elected. Donald Trump’s post-summit interview with Sean Hannity is being broadcast now on Fox. Trump began by repeating his claim that he “always had a great relationship with President Putin”, but cooperation between the United States and Russia was made impossible by the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, which he refers to as a “hoax”. He then said that he did have a chance to speak privately to Putin, after their brief, 12-minute news conference. Putin “spoke very sincerely”, Trump said about his desire to end the war in Ukraine. Trump did not mention that the war began with Putin’s decision to seize Ukrainian territory in 2014, after his ally was deposed as president of Ukraine in a popular uprising. It then intensified in 2022 when Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Asked by Hannity to rate the meeting on a scale of one to 10, Trump replied that it was “a 10” because it showed that the leaders of the two nuclear-armed nations could cooperate. “It’s good when two big powers get along,” Trump said. Hannity then pressed Trump to reveal what Putin told him about why he thought the war in Ukraine would not have started if Trump was president. Trump demurred, but said that he could say in his own words that the reason was that Biden was grossly incompetent. At the end of Donald Trump’s brief and somewhat defeated-sounding remarks after his meeting with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president extended an invitation to his US counterpart to hold the next round of talks in the Russian capital. “Again, Mr President, I’d like to thank you very much, and we’ll speak to you very soon and probably see you again very soon,” Trump said. “Thank you very much, Vladimir.” “Next time in Moscow,” Putin replied, chuckling. “Oh, that’s an interesting one,” Trump said. “I’ll get a little heat on that one, but I, uh, I could see it possibly happening.” On his way to Alaska, Donald Trump told Fox News anchor Bret Baier that his goal for the talks with Vladimir Putin was to get the Russian president to agree to a ceasefire. “So when you talk about deals, it’s all I do my whole life, I do deals, you never know, you don’t like to have too many expectations,” Trump told Baier in an interview recorded on Air Force One that was broadcast on Friday. “But we’re going to go and find out. I’d like to see a ceasefire. I wouldn’t be thrilled if I didn’t get it, but everyone says, ‘You’re not going to get the ceasefire, it’ll take place on the second meeting’, but I’m not going to be happy with that. “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire.” The White House pool reporter tells us that Donald Trump “is currently doing a previously announced interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News”. That interview, with an opinion host who is a strong supporter of the president and has campaigned for him, is scheduled to be broadcast on Hannity’s show in just over an hour. The interview was billed by the network as an exclusive look behind the scenes at what was supposed to have been a meeting of historic importance, perhaps comparable to Richard Nixon’s 1972 visit to China to meet chairman Mao Zedong. At the very least, Trump said that he hoped to convince the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to agree to an immediate ceasefire in his war on Ukraine. Now that Trump’s talks with Putin have failed to bring the war in Ukraine to an end, a conflict that he promised on the campaign trail he could end in 24 hours, his discussion with Hannity will no doubt be a good deal less celebratory. Among those scrambling to make sense of the 12-minute news conference, at which no questions were taken before Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin departed, are Fox News producers and correspondents who had hyped this meeting between the presidents of the United States and Russia as a summit of historic proportions, and one at which they would have exclusive access. The network planned to broadcast an exclusive preview of the summit, recorded with Trump en route to Alaska on Air Force One, as the talks went on, to be followed by a second exclusive interview with the president, conducted by Sean Hannity immediately after the talks, to be broadcast during his 9pm show on Fox. Those carefully laid plans were thrown into chaos by the briefness of both the talk and the news conference. Jacqui Heinrich, a Fox White House correspondent, just noted in a live report from the conference room that what unfolded was very different from what Trump administration officials told reporters to expect. The idea, Heinrich said, was that there would be a news conference with the two leaders, and the opportunity to question them, if the talks went well, but if the talks did not go well, only Trump would appear and Putin would be sent packing. “Neither of those things happened,” Heinrich noted. “And what was really stunning to me, as someone who has been in a lot of these press conferences, is there were a few things that were very unusual. You had Putin come out and address the press first. We are on US soil here.” “The way that it felt in the room was not good,” Heinrich also said. “It did not seem like things went well. And it seemed like Putin came in and steamrolled, got right into what he wanted to say and got his photo next to the president and then left.” As Heinrich tried to make sense of what had taken place, the corner of the screen on Fox promoted Trump’s interview with Hannity, which is still scheduled to air at 9pm ET. Putin also dominated the joint appearance in terms of speaking time. While the Russian leader spoke for about 8 minutes and 30 seconds, the US president was done in just under 3 minutes and 30 seconds. That was quick. Donald Trump left more questions than answers as he fawned over Vladimir Putin but gave precious few details about their high-stakes summit. “I believe we had a very productive meeting,” he said. “There were many, many points that we agreed on … There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call up Nato … I’ll of course call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today’s meeting … We really made some great progress.” He added: “I’ve always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin – with Vladimir … We were interfered with by the ‘Russia, Russia, Russia’ hoax.” Trump warmly thanked Putin, who invited him to Moscow, and dozens of reporters shouted questions but in vain. The US president, who can typically never resist talking and talking, left the stage without answering any of them. Donald Trump ended his brief remarks at the joint news conference by thanking Vladimir Putin, and saying that they would speak again soon. “Next time in Moscow,” Putin replied in English. Trump then called the news conference to an end without taking any questions from the assembled reporters, or offering any details of what Putin called the agreement they had reached in their three hours of talks. Donald Trump just began his very brief remarks by saying that the talks with Putin were “extremely productive” but more needs to be done to resolve the conflict in Ukraine. “I believe we had a very productive meeting. There were many, many points that we agreed on,” Trump said. “There’s no deal until there’s a deal. I will call up Nato … I’ll of course call up President Zelensky and tell him about today’s meeting.” “We really made some great progress,” Trump said without revealing any details of what that progress was. “I’m going to start making a few phone calls and tell them what happened, but we had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to,” Trump said. “There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant. But we have a very good chance of getting there, we didn’t get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.” Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have begun their joint press conference in Anchorage, Alaska, standing at lecterns against a blue backdrop that says “Pursuing peace”. Unusually, the visiting foreign leader went first. Speaking via Russian interpreter, Putin said he gave Trump a “neighbourly” greeting today because the US and Russia are neighbours and Alaska is a reminder of this. He acknowledged bilateral relations fell to the “lowest point since the cold war”. Putin described Trump’s efforts on Ukraine as “precious” and claimed “everything that’s happening is a tragedy for us and terrible wound”. Without giving details, Putin said today’s “agreement” could help Ukraine’s security and urged Europe to “not throw a wrench in the works” and “not use backroom dealings” to torpedo it. Putin says that he has reached an agreement with Trump and hopes that leaders in Kyiv “won’t throw a wrench” into the process of bring the war to an end. He offers no details on what the agreement is. He also repeated his frequent demand that the root causes of the conflict need to be addressed. In the past, Putin has suggested that those causes include the elected government of Ukraine, which he has falsely claimed is led by Nazis. Putin notes that Trump has claimed that the full-scale war that began with Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 would not have happened had Trump been the US president. Putin says that he agrees. Vladimir Putin is speaking first at the joint news conference in Alaska after his talks with Donald Trump wrapped up ahead of schedule. Putin said the talks were constructive before moving on to discuss the former Russian control of Alaska, noting the hundreds of Russian names of towns and numerous Russian Orthodox churches in the state. The Russian leader’s emphasis on the historical Russian “heritage” of the US state will not be comforting to Ukrainian listeners, given Putin’s claim that the entire country, which was once part of the Russian empire, should be considered part of the “Russian world”. “We have always considered the Ukrainian nation a brotherly nation,” Putin says. Donald Trump’s talks with Vladimir Putin on the war in Ukraine have concluded earlier than expected and a joint news conference with the two presidents is about to begin at a US military base in Anchorage, Alaska. We have live video from the room, and will bring you updates on their remarks here on the blog. The Russian foreign ministry reports on social media that the first round of talks between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump are over. Video posted on X by the ministry shows Putin walking away from the room and talking to his press secretary, Dmitry Peskov. The ministry says a joint news conference is expected to begin soon. The unexpectedly short talks have prompted speculation that the meeting did not go well. In advance of the summit, Trump did say: “I’ll know within the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes or five minutes. We tend to find out whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad meeting, and if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly”. Reporters have been called into the room set up for a joint news conference with Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, my colleague David Smith reports from Anchorage. We will bring you updates here once the event begins, but the timing is a bit of a surprise, since Trump’s aide, Dan Scavino, posted on X less than an hour ago that the first of two planned meetings between the US and Russian delegations was still taking place. That session, in which the two leaders were joined by two foreign policy advisers, was to have been followed by a larger working lunch. As our colleague David Smith reported from Anchorage earlier, Donald Trump applauded Vladimir Putin, several times, when the two men met on a red carpet at the US airbase where they are now meeting in private with their top foreign policy advisers. The Kremlin Press Office quickly distributed a photograph of the US president clapping for “his Russian counterpart” to news agencies. The fact that the US president clapped for the Russian president and indicted war criminal, prompted the Russia-born cold war historian Sergey Radchenko to post a mind-blown emoji on X. “I argued in my book how the Russians crave nothing quite as much as recognition by the U.S.” he added. “Well, there we have it. There it is.” Trump’s three rounds of applause were captured on a live stream on the White House YouTube channel. But, a few minutes later, when the White House posted video of the greeting on social media, the clip was edited to begin a split-second after Trump finished his third round of applause for Putin. The video posted on the official White House Instagram and X accounts shows that Trump’s left arm is still swinging by his side as the clip begins. A look at the original live stream reveals that his arm had just dropped to his side at that point, after being raised in front of the president to clap for the Russian leader wanted by the International Criminal Court for the kidnapping of Ukrainian children. As Donald Trump hosts Vladimir Putin for talks in Alaska aimed at ending the Russian war on Ukraine, some Ukrainians watching from afar have noticed that the US literally rolled out a red carpet for the Russian president, who is an indicted war criminal charged with kidnapping Ukrainian children from Russian-occupied regions of their country. Mustafa Nayyem, a Ukrainian journalist turned politician, posted an image of US soldiers kneeling to secure the red carpet laid at the foot of Putin’s plane before the Russian president emerged with the caption: “Make Kneeling Great Again”. Nayyem, who helped organize the 2013 protest movement on Maidan, Kyiv’s Independence Square, that toppled Putin’s ally Viktor Yanukovych, was not alone. Olga Rudenko, the editor of the Kyiv Independent, shared the same image with the caption: “This is Putin’s new phone wallpaper. American soldiers kneeling under the big letters reading RUSSIA. To fix the red carpet. For a war criminal.” The Russian presidential jet is emblazoned with the word RUSSIA, written in Cyrillic letters. A Ukrainian soldier, Oleksandr Solonko, wrote: “I feel very sorry for the American military who were forced to roll out the red carpet for the greatest war criminal whose propaganda system has been smearing their country for many years.” The symbolism did not go unnoticed in Russia. Video of the US troops kneeling on the carpet beneath Putin’s plane was posted on Telegram by the Russian news channel Zvezda, or Star, which is owned by the Russian defense ministry. That clip was later shared on X by a German who supports Ukraine and compared Putin to Hitler. “Western media are on the verge of completely losing it”, Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, observed on social media. “They spent three years telling everyone Russia was isolated, and today they saw the beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US”. As Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin began their summit in Alaska centered on ending Russia’s war on Ukraine, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, delivered an update on the fighting in a social media address from Kyiv. “On the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well. And that speaks volumes,” Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X accompanying his video update. He ran through a list of Russian targets. “Sumy – a Russian strike on the central market. Dnipro region – strikes on cities and enterprises. Zaporizhzhia, Kherson region, Donetsk region – deliberate Russian strikes. The war continues, and it is precisely because there is neither an order nor even a signal that Moscow is preparing to end this war,” Ukraine’s president said. “Russia must end the war that it itself started and has been dragging out for years,” he added. “The killings must stop. A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side – and it is precisely in such a format that effective decisions are possible. Security guarantees are needed. Lasting peace is needed.” The summit between the two leaders and their respective cabinet officials began at 11.32am local time. We’re getting some pictures of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, joined by their respective delegations in a room ahead of their meeting. Behind the leaders is a blue backdrop that had the words “pursuing peace” printed on it. The White House press pool, who are travelling with the president, say that Trump and Putin were sat in place by 11.26am local time, and the press were ushered out of the room by 11.27am. Wearing a dark suit, white shirt and red tie, the US president descended the stairs from Air Force One at 11.08am local time and looked glum as he walked a red carpet. Trump came to a stop and, as Putin approached, applauded the Russian leader, then gave him a warm handshake and friendly tap on the arm. Putin appeared to crack a joke and both men smiled. The men walked together towards a platform bearing the sign: “Alaska 2025” Reporters shouted questions at Putin including, “Will you agree to a ceasefire?” and “Will you stop killing civilians?” Putin appeared to shrug. Putin then joined Trump in the presidential limousine ‘The Beast’ – a rare privilege for allies and adversaries alike – and could be seen laughing. Trump and Putin drove away in the US president’s official car, nicknamed “the Beast”. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin de-boarded their respective aircrafts, shook hands, and stood on a stage with “ALASKA 2025” emblazoned on the front, as the world’s press captured the moment. Russian state media is reporting that Vladimir Putin will be joined by his foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and advisor Yuri Ushakov for his meeting with Donald Trump. It will now be a three-on-three summit, as the US president will be joined by secretary of state Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff. Russian president Vladimir Putin has landed in Anchorage, according to Russian state media. The president has yet to deplane, but is currently greeting Alaska governor Muke Dunleavy and senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, all Republicans, aboard Air Force One, per the White House. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also says that for the expanded bilateral meeting and lunch, Trump, Rubio, and Witkoff will be joined by treasury secretary Scott Bessent, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. As we wait for the president to deplane from Air Force One, it’s worth pointing out a nugget that my colleague, Jakub Krupa, reported earlier. Former Obama administration official and former managing editor of Time magazine, Richard Stengel, has objected to reports describing the Alaska summit as “high-stakes”, arguing on social media that it’s “a journalistic cliche” that “plays into Trump’s theatrical framing of the whole artificial made-for-TV ‘event’”. The city of Zaporizhzhia, an industrial hub in south-east Ukraine, is as good a place as any to grasp the stakes of freezing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine along its current frontlines, or of implementing a “land swap for peace” deal as envisioned by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. Since Russian troops began rolling into Ukraine in February 2022, Zaporizhzhia, with its broad avenues and Stalin-era apartment blocks, has been a 30-minute drive from the frontline. It has been under near-constant attack from missiles and drones. On Sunday, a Russian guided air bomb hit a bus station, wounding 24 people – just another day of suffering in a city that has known many of them. Plenty of people here and in other Ukrainian towns close to the frontline are so weary of the sleepless nights and disrupted lives of the past years that they are ready for Kyiv to sign a peace deal, even an imperfect one, if it means the attacks will stop. But many others have a very different opinion because they know first-hand what it means to give Russia control over Ukrainian territory: arrests, disappearances and the erasure of anything Ukrainian. As Moscow moves swiftly to Russify occupied territory, expelling or arresting active members of society and introducing new media outlets and school curricula heavy on propaganda, a few years of Russian control may make it almost impossible for Ukraine to regain these territories at a later date. About one in five people living in Zaporizhzhia are internally displaced, from places even closer to the frontline or from occupied parts of Ukraine. They are living in Zaporizhzhia until they are able to go home. Read more about the grim reality of ‘land swaps’, and what it would mean for people in Zaporizhzhia. The previously planned sit-down between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin will now include the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and special envoy Steve Witkoff, according to the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt. Air Force One has touched down at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson ahead of Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin. Ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, has said that Britain stands with Ukraine on “what will be an important day for the future of Ukraine and Euro-Atlantic security”. Lammy said he had spoken to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, and, in a post on social media, added: “I reiterated our enduring support and our commitment to work with the US and Ukraine to secure a just and lasting peace.” Greetings from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era military installation on the outskirts of Anchorage, that will play host to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin today. I am among an estimated 700 journalists from all over the world. We were greeted at Anchorage international airport by the sight of a majestic brown bear slain by Governor Mike Dunleavy and displayed as a trophy in a glass case. The media gathered downtown at 5.30am local time today and were bused to the air force base under a big sky with picturesque mountains. The airbase is like a small city with housing, children’s playgrounds, nondescript three-storey lodgings, a church with stained glass windows and great grassy expanses. The temperature is a crisp 50F. The Reuters news agency reported: “The Kremlin press pool was housed in an Alaska Airlines Center, where a semi-open-plan room was subdivided by partitions and some reporters were seen making their own camp-style beds. They were fed for free at a nearby university campus, Russian reporters said.” Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the cold war. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into US airspace. Putin’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in a sweatshirt with “CCCP” – the Russian letters for USSR – across the front. Today’s meeting could prove a win-win for the two leaders. Putin, an alleged war criminal who had been an international pariah, gets to meet the US president on American soil. Trump, for his part, gets to play global statesman in a massive media spectacle where no one is talking about Jeffrey Epstein. The plane transporting Russian government officials has landed in Anchorage, Alaska, according to Flightradar24. Welcome to our coverage of the US president’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska. This will be the first meeting with the Kremlin leader of Trump’s second term in office – and his seventh in total. I’m Shrai Popat, and I’ll be bringing you the latest – alongside my colleagues – from today’s event. The summit is set to kick off in just over an hour (3pm ET), at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. To get you up to speed, this is where things stand at the moment: Donald Trump has said, repeatedly, over the last few days that his chief aim of today’s meeting is to get a trilateral summit between Putin, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and himself on the books. In his own words, Trump wants this to happen “almost immediately”. He’s also convinced that he’ll be able to tell from the first few minutes of his meeting today whether it will be a success, and would be prepared to walk away “real fast” if he thinks it’s not going well, according to an interview with Fox News. Crucially, the president has said he’s not in Alaska to negotiate on behalf of Ukraine, but instead with the goal of “getting Putin to the table”. However, Trump has been less clear on what would constitute a success from his sit-down with the Kremlin leader today. Earlier, on Air Force One, the president told reporters that he wants to see a ceasefire “rapidly”. He added: “I don’t know if it’s going to be today, but I’m not going to be happy if it’s not today.” The president also repeated his stern words from earlier in the week that Russia could expect “severe consequences” if it fails to show willingness to end the war in Ukraine. “Economically severe. It will be very severe. I’m not doing this for my health, OK, I don’t need it. I’d like to focus on our country, but I’m doing this to save a lot of lives,” the president said. For Zelenskyy’s part, he said that Ukraine is “counting on America”. He’s been shut out of talks today, but reiterated his call for “an honest end to the war”, and said he hoped to see “a strong American position” during today’s talks in Alaska. When it comes to territory negotiations, Trump has said he’s not interested in deciding on those today without Ukraine present, and Zelenskyy has said categorically that Ukraine could not agree to a ceasefire deal which cedes territory, as Moscow could use this as a springboard to start a future war. Trump confirmed to Zelenskyy that he’ll be calling him first after today’s meeting wraps, and he’s set to brief European leaders after that debrief. Ahead of the today’s summit, the president posted on Truth Social that he had a “wonderful” call with the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, saying “the purpose of the call was to thank him for the release of 16 prisoners”, with 1,300 under discussion. The Belarussian leader is the country’s only president since it adopted its current constitution. Lukashenko has described himself as Europe’s “last and only dictator”, and is a notable Russian ally.
