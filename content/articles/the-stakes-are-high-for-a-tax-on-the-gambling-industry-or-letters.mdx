  Gordon Brown is right to call for a fair and targeted tax on the excessive
  profits of the gambling industry to help tackle child poverty (The gambling
  industry is a licence to print money. Tax it properly – and turbocharge the
  fight against child poverty, 6 August). This policy supports our shared goals
  of delivering sustainable public finances alongside improved public health
  outcomes as well as the government’s manifesto pledges to reduce
  gambling-related harms and alleviate child poverty. This £11.5bn sector
  benefits enormously from VAT exemptions and pays just 21% tax – far below the
  35%-57% rates elsewhere in western Europe and the US. By contrast, other
  harmful products like cigarettes and alcohol are taxed at up to 80%. At the
  same time, gambling leads to harms that cost the NHS and other services well
  over £1bn a year. The government must not be swayed by intensive lobbying and
  false claims of economic harm or the threat of illegal gambling from the
  gambling industry, which will of course resist these proposals. Instead, ahead
  of the child poverty review, the government must seize the opportunity in the
  next budget to tax a social harm to pay for a social good. Alex Ballinger MP
  Labour, Halesowen Dr Beccy Cooper MP Labour, Worthing West • The raising of
  taxes should go hand in glove with a move towards a full advertising ban of
  gambling, like Gordon Brown’s government did with tobacco. The new customer
  incentives are obscene. You wouldn’t get away with offering new customers a
  free packet of cigarettes, and neither should gambling companies get away with
  similar cash offers. Of course, the gambling industry will resist, as did
  tobacco before it, but the sky did not fall on our heads and other advertisers
  were found to fill the gaps, as they always will be. William Bartram Hampton,
  London • Gordon Brown’s article makes no mention of horse racing, which is a
  totally different form of gambling to online slots and, if his ideas are
  applied, will enter a terminal death spiral of diminishing returns, as your
  own correspondent Greg Wood has eloquently argued for years. By all means tax
  casinos and slots, but please exclude the one sport in which this country
  leads the world, not only in staging but also in competing. I also seem to
  recall that Brown was chancellor in the Blair government that deregulated the
  gambling industry, thereby ensuring that our seaside resorts and city centres
  are now home to casinos and the many slot machine arcades that blight our high
  streets – a thoroughly regrettable development on every level. Brown’s
  proposals will have unintended consequences and do little to alleviate
  poverty. Tim Harrison London • It is unfortunate that Gordon Brown fails to
  mention that Scotland is the only place in the UK where child poverty has
  fallen in recent years. This is due largely to the Scottish child payment of
  £27.15 a week per child to eligible families. This does not fully mitigate the
  effect of the two-child benefit cap, but is a good example of what small
  countries with constrained budgets can achieve. The UK government should be
  ashamed of its failure to learn from Scotland and act more swiftly on reducing
  child poverty. Shelagh Young Edinburgh • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
