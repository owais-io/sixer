  An employee shares a video of her “real time, emotional reaction” to being one
  of 2,200 people laid off from her company, including snippets of the company’s
  announcement and her one-on-one interview with HR employees, and her direct
  manager. A technical sales worker recorded a meeting where she was laid off to
  “inform her followers and demonstrate how volatile working in tech is”.
  Another worker posted a video of the moment she was laid off, including her
  “savage response” which earned her “huge amounts of praise from social media
  users”. It’s the latest viral social media trend: recording yourself being
  laid off. These employees are viewed in a mostly sympathetic light. And those
  giving advice generally direct their counsel towards business managers on how
  to handle this issue. Like the career expert who tells employers to “treat
  layoffs as emotional events, not just administrative tasks”, and “personalize
  career support”. It’s good advice for employers. Thank you. I’d like to give
  some advice to those who are recording their layoffs. But let me start with a
  question: why are you recording your layoff? What do you hope to accomplish by
  this? Is the goal to shame your employer? To make yourself a TikTok star? To
  “educate” others? To comfort yourself? There is no good reason for doing this.
  Don’t do this. For starters, if you’re part of a layoff, please understand the
  situation. Employers lay off workers for a reason. It’s usually economics. No
  manager or business owner wants to lay people off. No one is hiring someone
  with the intention of firing them in the future. No one is happy about this.
  For a big business, a layoff could mean an adjustment in overhead. But for a
  small business – where every employee is critical – a layoff is probably much
  more serious. So please don’t be so quick to shame the company. Next, don’t
  overthink this. This is clearly not about you. You’re probably doing a decent
  job. If it was about you, then you’d be the only one being fired. But
  unfortunately, you’re part of a mass event, caused by circumstances probably
  not in your control. This is bad luck. Sure, there may be others who – in your
  opinion – are more deserving of such a fate. But life is not fair. And you
  probably got caught up in its unfairness. Move on. Don’t record your layoff.
  Also, try to think ahead. The world is smaller than you might think. If you
  don’t believe me then check how many “2nd” and “3rd” connections you have on
  LinkedIn. Everyone you know knows someone else that you know … or may need to
  know in the future. Recording your layoff and – God forbid – becoming internet
  famous for it is not the kind of professional reputation you want to build for
  yourself. The trend may be viral but 99.9% of normal people don’t do this.
  They may like your post or make an anonymous comment. But that doesn’t mean
  they would act in the same manner. One woman who quit her job at a tech
  company and went viral for the video couldn’t find employment after six
  months, despite all the messages that people would “hire her in a heartbeat”.
  Don’t do this. I know that sometimes you have to make mistakes to learn from
  them. But let’s agree that not making a mistake is still the best avenue. So
  please: don’t make the mistake of recording your layoff. You’ll regret it.
