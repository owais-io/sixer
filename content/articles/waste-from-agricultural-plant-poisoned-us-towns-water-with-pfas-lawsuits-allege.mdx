  Wastewater from an industrial soya bean farm and processor has poisoned a
  Maryland town’s drinking water with Pfas, several lawsuits allege, raising
  questions about residents’ health and “forever chemical” pollution from
  industrial agricultural operations nationwide. Perdue Farms acknowledged that
  its 300-acre Salisbury, Maryland, operation is polluting local waters, but the
  chemicals’ sources have not been confirmed. It appears the Pfas are in part
  also coming from some combination of sludge used as fertilizer and pesticides,
  attorneys for plaintiffs say. The latest suit was filed in late July under the
  nation’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which requires toxic
  waste to be disposed of in a way that doesn’t harm human health. Some
  residents say the contaminated drinking water has sickened them, and the
  attorneys charge that Perdue, a company with $11bn in revenues, is not acting
  quickly enough, or taking proper measures to rein in the pollution since it
  was discovered in 2023. “The fact that they’ve had two years to do an
  investigation and they have not … is exceedingly frustrating,” said Phil
  Federico, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the RCRA lawsuit. “[Pfas] are a
  carcinogen for God’s sake – they cause cancer.” Pfas are a class of about
  15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and
  grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased
  immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health
  problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally
  break down in the environment. The suit alleges Perdue’s operation, 100 miles
  (160km) south-east of Baltimore, is spitting approximately 180,000 gallons of
  Pfas-contaminated wastewater daily into local waters, emitting Pfas into the
  air and contaminating groundwater. Perdue’s operation includes cropland, a
  soya bean processing facility, grain storage and an oilseed refinery, among
  other facilities. The company in 2023 applied for a permit to increase the
  level of contaminated wastewater it discharges. The RCRA lawsuit comes after
  the Maryland department of environment in 2023 discovered the Pfas during
  routine testing of waterways and initiated regulatory action to force Perdue
  to rein in its pollution. Early 2024 testing showed levels of some Pfas
  compounds in local streams and rivers that were as much as 350 times higher
  than federal limits for drinking water. State regulators also identified a
  huge Pfas plume in the groundwater probably stemming from the property. A
  class-action lawsuit filed in late 2024 on behalf of 500 nearby residents
  alleges Perdue learned of its pollution but did not warn area residents about
  the potential contamination of their water for over a year. The company showed
  “reckless indifference to the health and safety of the public”, according to
  the complaint, and it demands the company pay for clean water and health
  monitoring. In a statement, Perdue said it did not alert residents because
  state regulators had not yet concluded the company was responsible for the
  pollution. In a 28 February motion to dismiss the class-action suit, Perdue
  wrote: “’PFAS’ is not a magic word that can be invoked to open automatically
  the doors to federal litigation.” The lawsuit has not been dismissed. In a
  statement sent after publication, Perdue claimed it has installed treatment
  technology that is removing much of the Pfas from the wastewater. It has also
  recently said it completed testing at about 700 residential properties and had
  installed about 400 water treatment systems. Federico said the number of homes
  affected was almost certainly much higher – he estimates as many as 3,000
  people in the region are drinking contaminated water. Part of the motivation
  for the new RCRA lawsuit, Federico said, was the very slow pace at which
  Perdue has moved to identify the sources. Pesticides used on crops often
  contain Pfas, and sewage sludge used as fertilizer is virtually always
  contaminated with concerning levels of the chemicals. Unlined lagoons on the
  property that store wastewater and sludge are probably contaminating the
  groundwater, Federico said, and Pfas-laden firefighting foam may also have
  spilled or been used on the property. Meanwhile, there is evidence that the
  facility’s stacks or lagoons may be emitting Pfas air pollution, Federico
  said. The RCRA suit asks the courts to allow independent wastewater experts
  onsite to evaluate the potential sources, and to order Perdue to install a
  wastewater treatment plant that removes Pfas onsite, among other measures. The
  legal fight comes at a moment when public health advocates are starting to
  consider how industrial agriculture operations could be major sources of Pfas
  contamination, said Laura Orlando, a waste management engineer with the Just
  Zero non-profit. Sewage sludge has long been a concern, but advocates are also
  calling attention to other sources of Pfas, like pesticides, firefighting foam
  and other agricultural products. “Perhaps widening the stage will help
  strengthen the chorus that Pfas does not belong on the farm, from any source,”
  Orlando said. Perdue, in a statement to a local outlet, said the lawsuit was
  “motivated more by the law firm’s financial gain than by meaningful progress
  for communities affected by Pfas”. Federico dismissed the accusation. “If you
  want to keep doing what you’re doing in terms of production, then you’ve got
  to do it in an environmentally safe way – just spend the money and fix the
  problem,” Federico said. This article was updated on 13 August 2025 to include
  a statement sent from Perdue after publication.
