  Newcastle’s longstanding quest for a right-sided centre-back appears to be
  over after they agreed a £35m deal with Milan for their Germany defender
  Malick Thiaw. The 24-year-old flew to north-east England on Sunday night and
  was undergoing a medical on Monday. Before leaving Italy, Thiaw said:
  “Newcastle? I am happy with the choice. I’m ready for the Premier League.”
  Although Milan had wanted to keep Thiaw, the 6ft 4in defender, who will
  provide strong competition for Fabian Schär but can also operate at right-back
  and as a defensive midfielder, pushed hard to be allowed to join Newcastle.
  Thiaw’s arrival ends Newcastle’s interest in Crystal Palace’s England defender
  Marc Guéhi, the uncertainty over Alexander Isak’s future as the Sweden striker
  continues to agitate to be allowed to join Liverpool dictates Newcastle are
  stepping up their striker hunt. A deal for Brentford’s centre-forward Yoane
  Wissa is expected to be concluded this week and Newcastle have also enquired
  about the availability of the Porto striker Samu Aghehowa. The 21-year scored
  27 goals in 45 appearances last season and is understood to have a €100m
  (£86.6m) release clause. Isak is expected to continue to train separately from
  his teammates. Howe, who said he only wants players who “really want to play
  for this football club”, has indicated last season’s leading scorer will have
  no part in Saturday’s match at Aston Villa. West Ham are preparing an opening
  bid for the Southampton midfielder Mateus Fernandes. Graham Potter is looking
  to add energy and creativity in midfield but is yet to make summer additions
  there. West Ham are assessing a number of midfielders, including Aston Villa’s
  Jacob Ramsey and Lille’s Ngal’ayel Mukau, and have identified Fernandes as
  their top target. Fernandes joined Southampton from Sporting Lisbon for £15m
  last summer and is expected to leave after the club’s relegation. He could
  cost about £30m. The 21-year-old Portuguese caught the eye last season and is
  not short of interest, but West Ham are optimistic a deal will be struck.
  Southampton will want to make a big profit on Fernandes, who came off the
  bench in Saturday’s opening 2-1 win over Wrexham. West Ham have tracked
  Fernandes for more than a year. They were interested last summer but decided
  to go for other options. Potter came into this window hoping to sign at least
  two midfielders. However, West Ham, who have also tracked Werder Bremen’s
  Romano Schmid, have a limited budget and may need a sale before pursuing
  targets beyond Fernandes. They have struggled to find buyers for Guido
  Rodríguez and Edson Álvarez. Potter has switched to 3-4-2-1 and used James
  Ward-Prowse and the academy product Freddie Potts as his midfield duo in the
  friendly against Lille last Saturday. West Ham have been priced out of a move
  for Liverpool’s Harvey Elliott and did not act on interest in Tyler Morton
  before the England Under-21 midfielder joined Lyon.
