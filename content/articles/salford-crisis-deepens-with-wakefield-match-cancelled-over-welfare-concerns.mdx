  The crisis at Salford Red Devils has deepened on and off the field in the past
  24 hours. On Thursday, their chief operating officer claimed she had resigned
  after the club’s ownership suggested she “sleep with someone at the RFL” to
  alleviate their financial issues and on Friday the club’s Super League game
  against Wakefield on Sunday was cancelled. The Red Devils have been embroiled
  in controversy for most of 2025, following a takeover by a consortium led by
  Dario Berta. Players and staff have repeatedly been paid late, most of their
  first-team squad have left and the club is in court next month over an unpaid
  tax bill of almost £700,000. Matters hit a new low when Claire Bradbury, who
  joined as COO from rugby union’s Sale Sharks last year, announced she was
  leaving before saying she had been subject to “misogynistic language” from the
  club’s ownership. In a statement posted online she said: “It’s important to
  share something more personal, as a senior woman in business. Misogynistic,
  inappropriate language from the ownership suggesting I sleep with an
  individual at the RFL to ‘smooth things over’ is not acceptable. “At the time
  I stayed quiet because I wanted the club to succeed. I’m disappointed in
  myself that I didn’t stand up to it then so I’m voicing it now as it should be
  heard for the integrity and evolution of rugby league, and for all women who
  work in sport. “Repeated delays in salary payments, an absence of essential
  operational tools, and a lack of agreed structure, strategy, or investment
  have significantly impacted the ability of staff to perform their jobs
  effectively.” Salford responded to the allegations by announcing they will
  undertake an internal investigation, but the crisis took a further turn on
  Friday, when they conceded to the RFL that their game with Wakefield should be
  called off to protect the welfare of the players. They had 17 available, only
  two of which have appeared in Super League in the past 12 months, and would
  have to field a side predominantly filled with teenagers. Many Super League
  clubs have opted against loaning them players, having done so last week when
  Salford were beaten 80-6 by Hull FC. Unsurprisingly, the reserve game against
  Huddersfield on Saturday has also been called off. The RFL said they, Rugby
  League Commercial and Rugby League Cares have been in discussions with Salford
  throughout the week. Salford will probably have to forfeit the game 48-0, but
  they remain hopeful of being able to stage next Sunday’s game against Leigh,
  with several injured players due to return. However, it remains probable that
  whatever happens in the final six weeks of the regular season, Salford will
  not be a Super League club in 2026 and beyond, with the club set to be removed
  after a turbulent year that has now plummeted to fresh depths.
