  I am 83, and my life seems to have been mostly happy. But after a year at art
  college, I sort of disintegrated and was sent to a mental hospital after I had
  tried to kill myself several times. My best explanation is that life was too
  difficult and painful. But why? In the hospital I had 15 electric shock
  treatments. After the first one I didn’t recognise my mum. I had a blinding
  headache, and the fear of never waking up was strong. I was given
  antipsychotic drugs and sedatives. I caused a lot of worry to my parents, but
  I couldn’t “pull myself together”. Looking back, I see myself as a caring
  person who helped the confused and unhappy ladies who were locked away in that
  massive old mental hospital, where, in a way, I felt at home. Afterwards, I
  decided to go to Italy, where I recovered gradually and stopped the
  medication. I started teaching English and enjoyed it. Since then, I have
  lived a full and in many ways successful life. But the question is, what
  happened to me? People make seemingly random decisions all the time, but when
  we look back they had more purpose than they seemed to and were often informed
  by our environment. You were courageous, and still are for writing to me and
  thinking about this difficult time in your life, which must have been
  traumatic. And like all trauma, it’s stuck in your memory as snapshots, which
  you are now trying to make sense of. Trauma memories aren’t laid down like
  regular memories in the brain. You can learn more about this by listening to
  the podcast I did on this subject with Dr Joanne Stubley, a consultant medical
  psychotherapist who leads the trauma service for adults at the Tavistock and
  Portman NHS trust in England. I showed her your letter and we were both
  curious about what led up to your breakdown. Mental health issues were not
  always dealt with well in the early 1960s, and the landscape back then was, as
  Stubley describes it: “power-based and misogynistic”. Things aren’t perfect
  now, but there’s certainly more understanding. We also wondered what was
  happening around that time for you? What led to life being so difficult? Young
  people don’t have breakdowns and attempt suicide in a vacuum. “You showed
  great resilience moving to Italy,” said Stubley. “You had the capacity to get
  yourself up and away [from a place where difficult things happened] to live a
  life where you were giving to others, teaching English.” Even in the
  psychiatric hospital, you said you were looking after others. No wonder you’re
  thinking, “What about me? Who was thinking of me?” It’s not unusual to have
  these questions as we age and realise we have more years behind us than ahead.
  “You seem to have great courage and capacity to ask yourself these questions,”
  said Stubley. “That sense you have of, ‘What happened to me? What really went
  on here?’ is impressive.” One of the hallmarks of trauma is feeling alone in a
  situation, of being disempowered. A way to process it is to understand what
  happened. I wondered if you might try to find out if any of your medical notes
  from this time still exist. Stubley also suggested “starting to have
  conversations. It doesn’t have to be formal therapy. It could be with a good
  friend, a counsellor, anyone who would be able to offer you the space to
  explore and tell your life story so you may get more of an understanding of
  it. Are there any relatives alive from that time who you could talk to?” I
  thought it was interesting you made a geographical move, and to a place where
  English isn’t routinely spoken. You really left your old self behind, but now
  it’s time to integrate the two. You might also find this Guardian article
