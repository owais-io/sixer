  Wyoming saw a resurrection last week. Eight small towns across the vast rural
  state were reeling from the gut punch of the abrupt closures of their
  newspapers just a week earlier. Staff had woken up to an email from News Media
  Corporation (NMC) announcing the immediate closures of the printing presses.
  “It is with a heavy heart that I write to inform you that NMC will be closing
  its doors permanently,” NMC said in the email on 6 August. “Unfortunately, due
  to financial challenges, a significant economic downturn impacting our
  industry, revenue losses and increasing expenses, and the recent failure of an
  attempt to sell the company as a going concern, we have reached a point where
  continuing business is no longer feasible. This was a difficult decision, and
  it is in no way a reflection of your individual performance or dedication to
  the company.” The scene was not unique. According to the Local News
  Initiative, 3,200 local news outlets have vanished across the US since 2005.
  An estimated 55 million Americans do not have access to a local news source.
  Before the Wyoming residents were nearly added to the growing lists of news
  deserts, a miracle came. A group of Wyoming news executives stepped into the
  fold, buying eight of the papers – seven in Wyoming, and one just across the
  border in Nebraska. Printing would resume, and staff at the papers, who never
  stopped working during the closure, would receive full pay. Four South Dakota
  papers were brought back from the brink in a separate transaction as well. Rob
  Mortimore, one of the news executives who stepped up to purchase the Wyoming
  papers and the publisher of the Torrington Telegram, has worked in Wyoming
  news for 24 years, and sees the mission as vital. “When communities lose their
  newspaper, they lose their voice,” he said. Wyoming, the least populated state
  in the union, has just 11 towns with more than 10,000 people, and a total
  population clocking in at just under 600,000. Its windy plains, high sagebrush
  deserts and alpine peaks all contribute to a landmass larger than the United
  Kingdom’s. According to Jen Sieve-Hicks, executive editor at the Buffalo
  Bulletin, the state’s rural nature makes local papers all that more important.
  Sieve-Hicks noted that the town had no radio station, the nearest television
  station is 110 miles away, and the Bulletin is the only news source in a
  county as big as Delaware and Rhode Island combined. “We really are not only
  the main source – we are the only source of news in our community,” she said.
  “We are a connective tissue in the community.” Hicks has been at the Bulletin
  for 20 years, and her husband, Rob, have family roots in the Wyoming news
  business dating back 70 years. The couple, along with Mortimore, pooled
  together to buy the papers after their closure. The outlets are “100% locally
  owned” and the purchase has none of the private equity or hedge fund
  involvement that has gutted papers across the country. To Cali O’Hare,
  managing editor at the Pinedale Roundup, local control of rural news is vital.
  “Local ownership is key,” O’Hare said. “I think keeping the corporation, which
  sees us all as a bottom line and a number, I think keeping them out of it is
  so incredibly important.” O’Hare is no stranger to the demands of a rural
  newspaper or the dangers of news deserts. After earlier cuts, O’Hare has been
  a one-woman show at the Pinedale Roundup, which serves a county just smaller
  than the state of Connecticut, for the last 18 months. She handles everything
  from obituaries to the sports page. O’Hare has stuck through out of a
  commitment to her local community. “The first newsroom I ever worked in, we
  had a sign that hung in the back that said, ‘The hours are long, the pay
  sucks, but at least everybody hates you,’” O’Hare said. “So that’s kind of the
  mentality that I fall back on, just in service and sacrifice to my community.”
  O’Hare had a 100F fever the morning of 6 August, when she learned about the
  Roundup’s closure. She proceeded to pull an 18-hour day, cleaning out the
  office, stopping the presses for the coming issue and taking visits from
  long-time Sublette county residents wanting old copies of the paper that had
  served their community for the last 121 years. O’Hare spent the next two days
  working from a bed of Sublette county’s new hospital, whose opening she had
  covered just a week before, much to the chagrin of her doctors. She said that
  she, and other local Wyoming journalists, were firm believers that the closure
  wouldn’t stick. “Corporate could close its doors, but this was far bigger than
  corporate,” O’Hare said.
