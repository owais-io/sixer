  Newsmax, the conservative cable network run by Christopher Ruddy, has filed a
  lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the Rupert Murdoch-owned outlet of stifling
  competition in the rightwing television news market. The antitrust lawsuit,
  filed on Wednesday in the US district court for the southern district of
  Florida, names both Fox News Network and its parent company, Fox Corp. It
  claims the broadcaster carried out “an exclusionary scheme to increase and
  maintain its dominance in the market for US right-leaning pay TV news”. The
  complaint goes on: “Fox’s control over this must-have news channel gives it
  significant market power and leverage to impose onerous demands on
  distributors of its content. Fox leverages this market power to coerce
  distributors into not carrying or into marginalizing other right-leaning news
  channels, including Newsmax.” Newsmax alleges that the tactics used by Fox
  created an “unlawful monopolization of the Right-leaning Pay TV News Market”.
  It further states: “Fox’s longstanding and ongoing practices have harmed and
  will further harm competition and consumers in the United States.” Newsmax is
  asking the court to permanently block Fox from using the alleged exclusionary
  contracts, while also pursuing financial compensation. In a statement
  published on Newsmax’s website, Ruddy said: “Fox may have profited from
  exclusionary contracts and intimidation tactics for years, but those days are
  over.” “This lawsuit is about restoring fairness to the market and ensuring
  that Americans have real choice in the news they watch. If we prevail, Fox’s
  damages could be tripled under federal law – an outcome that would send a
  powerful message to any company that thinks it can monopolize public
  discourse,” he added. Fox News Media responded to the lawsuit in a statement
  shared with the Guardian: “Newsmax cannot sue their way out of their own
  competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they
  can’t attract viewers.” This lawsuit is not the first major legal battle that
  has embroiled both Fox and Newsmax. Last month, Newsmax reportedly agreed to
  pay $67m to Dominion Voting Systems to settle a defamation lawsuit over lies
  about voting in the 2020 election. Dominion had previously obtained a $787.5m
  defamation settlement from Fox in 2023. Dominion lawyers acquired internal
  communications from Fox hosts and personalities that showed they knew many of
  the outlandish claims they were broadcasting about the election were not true.
  Newsmax agreed to pay $40m to settle a defamation case against Smartmatic,
  another voting equipment company, last year.
