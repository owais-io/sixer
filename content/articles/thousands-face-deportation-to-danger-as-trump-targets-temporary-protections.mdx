  Many thousands of immigrants living in the US who came from certain countries
  regarded as risky or dangerous are at the mercy of US judges and the Trump
  administration’s agenda to slash their work authorization and protection from
  deportation. Since taking office, the Trump administration has announced the
  termination of temporary protected status (TPS) for citizens of seven of the
  15 countries previously designated for shelter under this legal umbrella –
  with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) controversially citing improved
  conditions in some of those places. The seven countries are Afghanistan,
  Haiti, Venezuela, Honduras, Nicaragua, Nepal and Cameroon, plunging many TPS
  holders in those US immigrant communities into confusion and fear and
  prompting groups of individuals and advocacy organizations to head for the
  courts to shield them, with varying degrees of success so far. On Wednesday, a
  federal appeals court sided with the Trump administration and halted, for now,
  a lower court’s order that had kept in place temporary protections for 60,000
  migrants from Central America and Nepal. This means that the Republican
  administration can move toward removing an estimated 7,000 people from Nepal
  whose TPS designations expired on 5 August. The TPS designations and legal
  status of 51,000 Hondurans and 3,000 Nicaraguans are set to expire on 8
  September, at which point they will become eligible for removal from the US.
  The National TPS Alliance group had sued, alleging that the administration’s
  plan was unlawful. In the case of Honduras and Nicaragua, some of their
  nationals in the US have held TPS status for over 25 years, since Hurricane
  Mitch caused devastating damage to both countries in the late 90s. In July,
  the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, said it was safe to return
  people to Nicaragua and Honduras. However, the United Nations said in a report
  that the Nicaraguan regime of co-presidents Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo
  “has deliberately transformed the country into an authoritarian state where
  opposition voices are silenced and the population faces persecution and
  economic retaliation”. And in April the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio,
  said: “The Nicaraguan regime is an enemy of humanity.” Meanwhile, Honduras has
  the highest rate of femicides in Latin America, according to Human Rights
  Watch, with approximately seven femicides per 100,000 women, and across the
  nation the UN says 1.6 million people live with urgent humanitarian needs out
  of a population of 7 million. More than 50,000 Hondurans in the US are TPS
  holders. Nepal was initially designated for TPS in 2015 after an earthquake
  disrupted and displaced millions. Noem said that “there are notable
  improvements in environmental disaster preparedness and response capacity”.
  Earlier this year, amid economic and political instability in the country,
  Nepal was experiencing violent clashes between civilians and police. The
  Guardian has previously reported on how the Trump administration has deported
  Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and are now living in a refugee
  camp. Meanwhile, last month, an appellate court authorized the Trump
  administration to end TPS for more than 8,000 Afghans and 5,000 Cameroonians.
  In the case of the Afghan immigrant population in the US, many, including some
  who assisted US forces in Afghanistan before the botched withdrawal by the
  military in 2021, are already at risk of deportation. Fereshta Abbasi,
  Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, says anyone deported to
  Taliban-ruled Afghanistan could face persecution or torture. “For example, on
  the deportation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan, we were able to document
  cases that, especially former government employees, once they’re back in
  Afghanistan, they’re picked up by the authorities and they’re being
  arbitrarily detained and tortured; that’s a real risk for anyone who’s
  deported back to Afghanistan,” said Abbasi. She added: “The Taliban have not
  only taken away the fundamental rights of women, they have taken women’s
  autonomy as well. I’ve spoken to women in Afghanistan who have told me that
  they feel they are living in a prison. The US knows that Afghanistan is not a
  safe country.” The Department of Homeland Security has cited rising tourism as
  a factor in its assessment that Afghans can be deported back there, with the
  US Federal Register’s item about revoking TPS for Afghans saying: “Tourism to
  Afghanistan has increased, as the rates of kidnappings have reduced.” However,
  the US has also issued a travel warning for Afghanistan, advising Americans
  not to visit the country due to civil unrest, crime, terrorism and risk of
  wrongful detention. The international criminal court issued arrest warrants
  for two Taliban leaders, accused of crimes against humanity for the
  persecution of women and girls. An elderly British couple detained without
  charge after years of living in Afghanistan are in danger of dying in custody,
  relatives have warned. And Afghans living in or with the prospect of returning
  to Afghanistan who are known or even just suspected by the Taliban of having
  assisted US or British forces there could be in mortal danger. The US Congress
  established TPS as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, signed by the then
  president, George HW Bush. The estimated 1 million TPS holders in the US
  overall have not only used the program’s benefits to support themselves in the
  US workplace, but also to contribute an estimated $21bn annually to the
  economy, while paying $5.2bn in taxes, according to the advocacy group Fwd.us.
  The Trump administration has also announced it will end TPS for Haitian
  immigrants living in the US legally under the scheme. The US embassy in Haiti
  warns people not to travel to the Caribbean nation, citing kidnapping and
  civil unrest, as does the US state department website. While Noem acknowledged
  that conditions in Haiti remained dire, she said it was not in the national
  interest of the US to continue the TPS program for Haitians. The poorest
  country in the western hemisphere, Haiti has been engulfed in political tumult
  since the assassination of the then president, Jovenel Moïse, in 2021. The
  descent for the already-unstable country into further crisis has displaced 1.3
  million Haitians, according to the International Organization for Migration,
  and local authorities estimate that 5.7 million face food insecurity. An
  estimated 340,000 Haitians in the US who are currently covered by TPS – a
  designation initially made in 2010 following the devastating earthquake that
  year – will no longer have this protection from deportation after 2 September.
  Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, an
  immigrant support group in the US, said some of the people already deported to
  Haiti “are just dropped off” and “their family relatives don’t know what
  happened to them”. “The termination of TPS is a complete unwillingness to
  acknowledge the humanity of these immigrants, whom many of them have been in
  the country for over 15 years. Many of them have children who were born and
  raised here,” Jozef said. “The entire Black immigrant community doesn’t fit
  the agenda, or are not deemed dignified enough, or not deemed worthy enough of
  the protection that those people need. We are at a point where they don’t care
  how long they have been here, that they have paid their taxes, that they have
  businesses.” Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, remains largely under gang
  control and armed conflict has rendered the city inaccessible from both the
  north and south. Violent groups dominate the city center and surrounding
  areas, with only two districts spared, where camps for internally displaced
  people have multiplied, sheltering tens of thousands who have fled violence.
  In this parlous condition, the prospect of mass deportations from the US is
  alarming local organizations already struggling to cope. “Where will families
  whose homes have been burned down go?” Katia Bonté, coordinator of the Support
  Group for Returnees and Refugees (GARR) in Haiti, asked. Her organization
  already operates along the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic,
  assisting people expelled daily back to Haiti under a crackdown by the
  Dominican government launched last October. Bonté fears a similar wave from
  the US would overwhelm already fragile systems. “Deported Haitians won’t be
  able to return to their families or communities. I visit the displacement
  camps. I see how people survive. It’s inhumane – the impact would be
  devastating,” she said, adding: “There’s not much hope left. It feels like
  we’re on our own, and no one is coming to help.” Meanwhile, the Trump
  administration is reportedly eyeing Honduras and Nicaragua as places to send
  people who are from neither country originally but are being deported from the
  US, and has done a deal with Rwanda and, on Wednesday, with Uganda. There was
  uproar from many directions when the US government deported, without due
  process, a group of people from a variety of countries to South Sudan and
  Eswatini this summer. The Associated Press contributed reporting
