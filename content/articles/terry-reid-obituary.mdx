  Terry Reid’s remarkable singing voice ensured he stood out in a golden age of
  British rock vocalists. So much so that in the late 1960s both Jimmy Page and
  Ritchie Blackmore, the respective guitarists and leaders of the heavy rock
  bands Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, approached him to front their groups. That
  Reid, who has died of cancer aged 75, turned them both down, could have
  reduced him to a footnote in rock history, yet his singular talent continued
  to be recognised by musicians from Aretha Franklin to Dr Dre. Reid’s lack of
  chart success – he would only release six studio albums in a career that
  spanned almost 60 years – should not detract from his achievements: alongside
  his powerful voice (his nickname was “Superlungs”), he was also a gifted
  guitarist and songwriter, while two of his albums, River (1973) and Seed of
  Memory (1976), would achieve retrospective critical acclaim and find, once
  reissued, a far wider audience than when first released. Reid was also a
  valued collaborator: he performed and/or recorded with musicians from the
  Brazilian vocalist Gilberto Gil, through the Californian singer-songwriters
  Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt, to the rap producer Dr Dre. When declining
  Page, Reid recommended he seek out Robert Plant, a teenage vocalist that he
  had encountered in the Midlands, and his band’s drummer, John Bonham, and thus
  Led Zeppelin was born. “It’s good to check your ego and support other artists’
  visions,” Reid told the Guardian in 2024, adding, “I’m part of a society of
  musicians and I love that I can go out there and sing.” Born in Little Paxton,
  Cambridgeshire, to Grace (nee Barber) and Walter Reid, Terry was raised in the
  village of Bluntisham. Walter owned a tractor dealership while Grace managed a
  small orchard that grew apples for cider. Reid recalled that his mother would
  stand him on a crate so that he could sing to the women she worked alongside
  during the apple harvest. Attending St Ivo school in St Ives, Cambridgeshire,
  Reid formed the Redbeats with schoolmates, and regularly played local venues.
  One evening in 1965 at the Palais in Peterborough, the Redbeats supported
  Peter Jay and the Jaywalkers, an instrumental rock band. Jay was so impressed
  by the 15-year-old Terry that he approached his father to ask if he could join
  the Jaywalkers as vocalist. Parental permission granted, Reid left school and
  relocated with the Jaywalkers to London. He then underwent an intensive
  apprenticeship singing R&amp;B hits in pubs and clubs across Britain. Keith
  Richards and Mick Jagger witnessed a performance at the Marquee club in 1966
  and invited the Jaywalkers to join the Rolling Stones’ UK tour alongside Ike
  and Tina Turner and the Yardbirds, featuring Page, who would later invite Reid
  to join his new band. Reid, however – with shout-outs from Franklin, who told
  the press on a 1968 visit to the UK that “there are only three things
  happening in England: the Rolling Stones, the Beatles and Terry Reid” – was
  determined to go solo. The same year, Mickie Most, then one of Britain’s most
  successful pop producers, signed him. While Most had launched such acts as
  Donovan and the Animals, he and Reid failed to gel; Reid’s somewhat
  overwrought vocals on his 1968 debut album, Bang, Bang You’re Terry Reid, met
  with public indifference. In 1969, after recording his eponymous second album,
  Reid was again invited by the Stones to join them on tour, this time across
  the US. Before the tour, however, he fell out irreparably with Most, yet found
  himself locked into a recording contract. The album was stronger than Reid’s
  debut, but Most declined to promote it. Reid relocated to California and
  continued to tour, performing at Glastonbury festival in 1971 (so appearing in
  Glastonbury Fayre, a feature documentary co-directed by Nicolas Roeg), while
  litigation with Most continued. Atlantic Records finally resolved the dispute
  and signed Reid, releasing his 1973 album River. A beautifully meandering
  blend of rock, folk, blues, jazz and bossa nova that baffled many (including
  Atlantic) when initially released – its abstract textures did not attract
  radio play – it was appreciated by a new audience on its reissue in the early
  2000s. Similarly Seed of Memory, on ABC, and produced by Reid’s friend Graham
  Nash, failed to reach listeners at the time, despite following more
  conventional song structures. On Rogue Waves (1978), Reid performed uninspired
  rock versions of 60s-era pop hits and pleased no one. He retreated to working
  as a session musician, returning for the 1991 album The Driver. With a
  bombastic production by Trevor Horn, Reid appeared adrift on his own album.
  Reid sat out much of the 90s until a Monday night residency at a Beverly Hills
  bar became a magnet for his fans – one of whom, Thomas Brooman, director of
  Womad festival, invited Reid to perform at the 2002 event. Chris Johnson, a
  film producer who had licensed one of Reid’s songs for the 1999 British
  feature The Criminal, organised some more UK dates, and Reid began regularly
  performing on this side of the Atlantic, returning to Womad and Glastonbury
  festivals alongside summer tours and residencies at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club.
  This led to the 2012 Live In London album, his final release. The reissues of
  River and Seed of Memory brought renewed media attention and approaches from
  younger musicians such as Alabama 3 and DJ Shadow. His songs also began to be
  placed in Hollywood films, while the actor Johnny Depp funded new recordings
  by Reid (so far unreleased). A UK tour for this September was cancelled after
  Reid was diagnosed with cancer in June. A 1976 marriage to Susan Johnson ended
  in divorce in 1982. Reid is survived by his second wife, Annette (nee Grady),
  whom he married in 2004, and two daughters, Kelly and Holly, from a previous
  relationship. • Terry (Terrance James) Reid, singer, guitarist and songwriter,
  born 13 November 1949; died 4 August 2025
