  Alex Foster’s sparky debut novel is built around a new technology of travel.
  Pods launch high into the sky and connect with one of thousands of “circuit
  vessels”, all orbiting the world from east to west. Travellers then descend in
  another pod, arriving wherever they choose. Spring-loaded pads store the pod’s
  kinetic energy when they land, and propel them up again when they launch. It’s
  so cheap, so rapid and so ubiquitous that everyone uses it. You can work in
  London, meet a friend for lunch in New York and come back to work that
  afternoon. The novel’s narrator, Tanner Kelly, has grown up in rural Alaska, a
  backwater without a pod station. He is only too glad to escape, getting a
  glamorous job in London as personal assistant to scientist Victor Bickle, who
  works for CWC, the company that runs the network. Bickle’s job is selling
  CWC’s services and whitewashing their effects. As the company’s booming chief
  of communications, Cromwell Grant, tells Tanner: “every CWC customer demands
  two things. He demands the products and services we provide. And he demands a
  clean conscience with which to consume them.” The clean conscience is an issue
  because the pod technology is harming the world, accelerating the Earth’s
  rotation. CWC deny that “day contraction” has anything to do with pod
  transportation, but this is a lie. This effect is small-scale at first, days
  becoming a few minutes shorter, but across the course of the novel we go from
  days of 23 hours and 45 minutes to days of 22 hours, of 20 hours, of 12 hours,
  the Earth spinning more and more rapidly. Foster likens it to ants on a
  floating log. Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, 1,000
  ants all running on top of the log in the same direction will spin the log
  beneath them. Workdays contract, circadian rhythms are shattered, people take
  stimulants to stay awake and then sedatives to get any sleep. It is a metaphor
  for climate change, of course, and a good one: the novel dramatises people’s
  incapacity, or more precisely their unwillingness, to address the problems
  they are causing the world. Pod travel is so convenient, and it is so
  important to the economy, to transport and trade, that people will not give it
  up. Days pass in six hours, rotation becoming so fast that the centrifugal
  effect counteracts gravity, with the oceans and atmosphere bulging at the
  equator and the ground in the northern and southern hemispheres starting to
  slope, turning the world into a surreal funhouse environment. Rather than ban
  pods, “the shell” is created, a world-encircling ceiling built on gigantic
  pillars to keep the air inside and to recycle water through pipes to where it
  is needed. This isn’t very plausible, and requires humanity missing more
  obvious solutions (since the day contraction is caused by the pods and circuit
  vessels travelling east to west, couldn’t we just reverse their direction of
  travel and slow the rotation down?). But by this point in the novel realism
  has been superseded by satire. Rather than dialling down pod transport, the
  network is hugely expanded. The inside of the shell has adverts projected upon
  it. A protester explodes a bomb at a CWC event, shouting, ironically,
  “revolution!” Days pass in three hours, then two, and the momentum of the
  story hurtles to its unavoidable catastrophic finale. It is a sharp conceit,
  and would make for a memorable short story. Foster expands it to novel length
  by developing his main characters, and dwelling on their relationships.
  Tanner, working for CWC, is complicit in the global disaster, but he is not
  consumed by guilt: on the contrary, he loves his job, is glad to have escaped
  his backwater religious-fundamentalist home, excited by big-city living,
  falling in love with his dishy co-worker Miguel. As the days shorten and work
  becomes increasingly exhausting, things sour with Miguel and the story gives
  us a great deal of to and fro of their breakup: too much, really. A second
  main character, teenage Winnie Pines, whose father has disappeared and whose
  mother is in a coma, self-harms by giving herself electric shocks. As the
  world accelerates, she overcomes her shyness and low self-esteem, gets a job,
  and her storyline converges with Tanner’s. A nuanced and interesting
  character, Winnie is the work of a writer with real talent. The prose is
  lively, too: vivid, full of lovely touches, and equally able to describe the
  large-scale disasters, thunderstorms, earthquakes, end-of-days big-screen
  doom, and the minutiae of ordinary living. The book isn’t flawless. The
  realness of Winnie throws into relief the two-dimensionality of many of the
  other characters, and the warping of time makes it hard to be sure what the
  pacing is. But this is an impressive debut about people struggling on with
  their lives in a world literally spinning out of control. • Circular Motion by
  Alex Foster is published by Grove (£18.99). To support the Guardian, order
