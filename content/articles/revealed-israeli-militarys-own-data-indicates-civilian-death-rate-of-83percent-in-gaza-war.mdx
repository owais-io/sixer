  Gaza war

  Figures from a classified Israeli military intelligence database indicate five
  out of six Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in Gaza have been civilians,
  an extreme rate of slaughter rarely matched in recent decades of warfare. As
  of May, 19 months into the war, Israeli intelligence officials listed 8,900
  named fighters from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad as dead or “probably
  dead”, a joint investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian
  publication +972 Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call has found.
  At that time 53,000 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli attacks, according
  to health authorities in Gaza, a toll that included combatants and civilians.
  Fighters named in the Israeli military intelligence database accounted for
  just 17% of the total, which indicates that 83% of the dead were civilians.
  That apparent ratio of civilians to combatants among the dead is extremely
  high for modern warfare, even compared with conflicts notorious for
  indiscriminate killing, including the Syrian and Sudanese civil wars. “That
  proportion of civilians among those killed would be unusually high,
  particularly as it has been going on for such a long time,” said Therése
  Pettersson from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, which tracks civilian
  casualties worldwide. “If you single out a particular city or battle in
  another conflict, you could find similar rates, but very rarely overall.”
  8,900 Named fighters listed as dead or ‘probably dead’ in Israeli database as
  of May 2025 In global conflicts tracked by UCDP since 1989, civilians made up
  a greater proportion of the dead only in Srebenica – although not the Bosnian
  war overall – in the Rwandan genocide, and during the Russian siege of
  Mariupol in 2022, Pettersson said. Many genocide scholars, lawyers and human
  rights activists, including Israeli academics and campaign groups, say Israel
  is committing genocide in Gaza, citing the mass killing of civilians and
  imposed starvation. The Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the
  database or dispute the data on Hamas and PIJ deaths when approached for
  comment by Local Call and +972 Magazine. When the Guardian asked for comment
  on the same data, a spokesperson said they had decided to “rephrase” their
  response. A brief statement sent to the Guardian did not directly address
  questions about the military intelligence database. It said “figures presented
  in the article are incorrect”, without specifying which data the Israeli
  military disputed. It also said the numbers “do not reflect the data available
  in the IDF’s systems”, without detailing which systems. A spokesperson did not
  immediately respond when asked why the military had given different responses
  to questions about a single set of data. The database names 47,653
  Palestinians considered active in the military wings of Hamas and PIJ. It is
  based on apparent internal documents from the groups seized in Gaza, which
  have not been viewed or verified by the Guardian. Multiple intelligence
  sources familiar with the database said the military viewed it as the only
  authoritative tally of militant casualties. The military also considers the
  Gaza health ministry toll reliable, Local Call has reported, and the former
  head of military intelligence appeared to cite it recently, even though
  Israeli politicians regularly dismiss the numbers as propaganda. 52,928 Gaza
  health ministry’s overall death toll as of 14 May 2025 Both databases may
  underestimate casualty numbers. The Gaza ministry of health lists only people
  whose bodies have been recovered, not the thousands buried under rubble.
  Israeli military intelligence are not aware of all militant deaths or all new
  recruits. But the databases are the ones used by Israeli officers for war
  planning. Israeli politicians and generals have variously put the number of
  militants killed as high as 20,000, or claimed a civilian-to-combatant ratio
  as low as 1:1. The higher totals cited by Israeli officials may include
  civilians with Hamas links, such as government administrators and police, even
  though international law prohibits targeting people not engaged in combat.
  They probably also include Palestinians with no Hamas connections. Israel’s
  southern command allowed soldiers to report people killed in Gaza as militant
  casualties without identification or verification. “People are promoted to the
  rank of terrorist after their death,” said one intelligence source who
  accompanied forces on the ground. “If I had listened to the brigade, I would
  have come to the conclusion that we had killed 200% of Hamas operatives in the
  area.” Itzhak Brik, a retired general, said serving Israeli soldiers were
  aware that politicians exaggerated the Hamas toll. Brik advised the prime
  minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at the start of the war and is now among his
  most strident critics. “There is absolutely no connection between the numbers
  that are announced and what is actually happening. It is just one big bluff,”
  he said. Brik commanded Israel’s military colleges, and said he kept in touch
  with serving officers. He described meeting soldiers from a unit identifying
  Palestinians killed in Gaza, who told him “most of them” were civilians. Even
  though much of Gaza has been reduced to ruins and tens of thousands of people
  killed, the classified database lists nearly 40,000 people considered by the
  army to be militants and still alive. Casualty estimates from Hamas and PIJ
  members also indicated Israeli officials were inflating the militant toll in
  public statements, said Muhammad Shehada, a Palestinian analyst. By December
  2024 an estimated 6,500 people from the military and political wings of both
  groups had been killed, members told him. “Israel expands the boundaries so
  they can define every single person in Gaza as Hamas,” he said. “All of it is
  killing in the moment for tactical purposes that have nothing to do with
  extinguishing a threat.” The ratio of civilian casualties among the dead may
  have increased further since May, when Israel tried to replace UN and
  humanitarian organisations that had fed Palestinians throughout the war.
  Israeli forces have killed hundreds of people trying to get food from
  distribution centres in military exclusion zones. Now starving survivors,
  already forced into just 20% of the territory, have been ordered to leave the
  north as Israel prepares for another ground operation that is likely to have
  catastrophic consequences for civilians. The scale of the killing was partly
  owing to the nature of the conflict, said Mary Kaldor, professor emeritus at
  the LSE, director of the Conflict Research Programme and author of New Wars,
  an influential book about warfare in the post-cold-war era. International
  humanitarian law was developed to protect civilians in conventional wars, in
  which states deploy troops to face each other on the battlefield. This is
  still largely the model for Russia’s war in Ukraine. In Gaza Israel is
  fighting Hamas militants in densely populated cities, and has set rules of
  engagement that allow its forces to kill large numbers of civilians in strikes
  on even low-ranking militants. “In Gaza we are talking about a campaign of
  targeted assassinations, really, rather than battles, and they are carried out
  with no concern for civilians,” Kaldor said. The ratio of civilians among the
  dead in Gaza was more comparable to recent wars in Sudan, Yemen, Uganda and
  Syria, where much of the violence had been directed against civilians, she
  said. “These are wars where the armed groups tend to avoid battle. They don’t
  want to fight each other, they want to control territory and they do that by
  killing civilians,. “Maybe that is the same with Israel, and this is a model
  of war [in Gaza] that is about dominating a population and controlling land.
  Maybe the objective always was forced displacement.” Israel’s government says
  the war is one of self-defence after the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023,
  which killed 1,200 people. But political and military leaders regularly use
  genocidal rhetoric. The general who led military intelligence when the war
  began has said 50 Palestinians must die for every person killed that day,
  adding that “it does not matter now if they are children”. Aharon Haliva, who
  stepped down in April 2024, said mass killing in Gaza was “necessary” as a
  “message to future generations” of Palestinians, in recordings broadcast on
  Israeli TV this month. Many Israeli soldiers have testified that all
  Palestinians are treated as targets in Gaza. One stationed in Rafah this year
  said his unit had created an “imaginary line” in the sand and fired at anyone
  who crossed it, including twice at children and once at a woman. They shot to
  kill, not to warn, he said. “Nobody aimed for their legs”. Neta Crawford, a
  professor of international relations at Oxford University and co-founder of
  the Costs of War project, said Israeli tactics marked a “worrisome”
  abandonment of decades of practices developed to protect civilians. In the
  1970s public revulsion about American massacres in Vietnam forced western
  militaries to shift how they fought. New policies were imperfectly implemented
  but reflected a focus on limiting harm to civilians that no longer appeared to
  be part of Israel’s military calculus, she said. “They say they’re using the
  same kinds of procedures for civilian casualty estimation and mitigation as
  states like the United States. But if you look at these casualty rates, and
  their practices with the bombing and the destruction of civilian
  infrastructure, it is clear that they are not.”
