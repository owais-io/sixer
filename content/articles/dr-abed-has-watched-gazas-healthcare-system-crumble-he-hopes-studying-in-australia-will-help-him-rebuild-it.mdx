  Junior paediatrician Abdalkarim Alharazin has seen more suffering and death in
  Gaza than some doctors do in their entire careers. The 28-year-old, who goes
  by the name Dr Abed, has spent the last two years moving between hospitals
  putting to use his medical training to treat fellow Palestinians as they have
  endured relentless Israeli bombardment, forced displacement, starvation and
  the spread of disease. He is currently working from a tent operating as a
  medical clinic in northern Gaza, where he says the conditions are “totally
  unimaginable”. “It is extremely difficult – there is no way to describe how
  much it is not a suitable environment to treat children,” he told Guardian
  Australia’s Full Story podcast over a weak internet connection. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Abed said the overwhelming number of children he saw each
  day were showing signs of dehydration due to malnutrition and an outbreak of
  gastroenteritis was making a dire situation even worse. “We are in 2025 seeing
  children dying because we don’t have IV fluids for them,” he said. “We have
  reached a level that we have to choose between our children, between the
  patients who we can give this IV fluid, and who can be strong enough for one
  hour or two hours.” Some nations have begun conducting aid drops, but
  humanitarian organisations have warned they are ineffectual and woefully
  inadequate to meet the needs of the 2 million people facing a human-made
  famine, and that they also pose a danger themselves. Abed said a colleague was
  struck and killed by a falling pallet this week. “We live day by day and we
  are trying to survive day by day,” he said. Local media reported a nurse, Oday
  al-Quraan, was crushed when he was hit in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza on
  Monday, just days after he described the air drops as “air humiliation” in an
  online video. Over 21 months, Abed has watched Gaza’s healthcare system
  crumble around him, as hospitals have been hit by Israeli airstrikes. More
  than 1,200 of his peers have been killed, and medical supplies have been
  blocked by Israeli authorities. “The health system is totally destroyed. It
  has reached a level of zero, actually under zero,” he said. Abed graduated
  from Al-Azhar University in Gaza in 2021, before eventually joining Kamal
  Adwan hospital’s paediatrics department as an emergency doctor, where he
  worked under the leadership of its director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya. Both the
  university and hospital now lie in ruins and Abed fears the fate of his
  mentor. Abu Safiya is among hundreds of doctors and medical workers who have
  been forcibly taken from Gaza by Israeli soldiers and held in detention
  without charge, according to the Palestinian group Healthcare Workers Watch.
  “Dr Hussam has a special place in my heart … he gave me the first opportunity
  to work. He was determined and committed to his community and to serve them as
  much as he can,” Abed said. Abed said he also wanted to continue to serve his
  community and one day contribute to rebuilding the health system, which the
  United Nations has said Israel has deliberately destroyed. From the frontlines
  he applied for and has been accepted into a master of public health at the
  University of Sydney – a dream he said he thought would be “impossible”. “I’m
  not taking this as an opportunity just to leave Gaza, no – I did it for Gaza,”
  he said. “The modules at this university will equip me with the knowledge and
  the skills that are needed to be a big part of rebuilding the healthcare
  system, rebuilding the sanitation system.” Dr Abed said most healthcare
  workers in Gaza were not earning an income, despite working non-stop, and even
  those that were struggled to afford essentials for themselves and their
  families. With support from the Brussels-based NGOs Children Not Numbers and
  Fill That Gap he has paid a course deposit, and is now raising funds to cover
  the necessary tuition fees, visa costs and living expenses. On a fundraising
  page for Dr Abed, the director of Fill That Gap, Dr Mandana Mehta, said Abed
  wanted “to be part of a better future for Gaza”. “Paying for university
  studies is increasingly difficult for many of us and our families. So imagine
  how much more difficult it becomes when you are a young Palestinian struggling
  to survive the bombardment of Gaza,” she said. “Imagine how much more
  difficult it is when you are one of the few remaining doctors in Gaza, working
  with almost no resources to try and save as many lives as you can.” If Dr Abed
  can overcome the financial hurdles, he hopes to begin studying in Australia
  next year. “If I am not able to secure the rest of the funds I will not lose
  this dream,” he said.
