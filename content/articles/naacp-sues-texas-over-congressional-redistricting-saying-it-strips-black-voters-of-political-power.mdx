  Texas’s redrawn congressional maps have drawn a lawsuit from the NAACP,
  accusing the state of committing a racial gerrymander with its maps that strip
  Black voters of their political power. The lawsuit, joined by the Lawyers
  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, names Texas’s Republican governor, Greg
  Abbott, and secretary of state, Jane Nelson, as defendants. It asks a federal
  judge for a preliminary injunction preventing the use of the redrawn maps,
  arguing that the redistricting violates the US constitution by improperly
  reducing the power of voters of color. It also argues that the maps violate
  section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “We now see just how far extremist leaders
  are willing to go to push African Americans back toward a time when we were
  denied full personhood and equal rights,” the president of the Texas NAACP,
  Gary Bledsoe, said in a statement. “We call on Texans of every background to
  recognize the dangers of this moment. Our democracy depends on ensuring that
  every person is counted fully, valued equally and represented fairly. We are
  prepared to fight this injustice at every level. Our future depends on it.”
  Texas Republicans passed a redrawn map on Saturday, with the expected result
  of an increase in Republican representation by five seats in the next
  Congress. Democratic state legislators are a minority in both chambers of the
  Texas legislature, leaving them with few options to block it. A group of state
  house representatives spent nearly a month away from the state to deny
  Republicans a quorum. That maneuver ended last week, after California’s
  governor, Gavin Newsom, and the state legislature began a process to counter
  the Republican gerrymander with a Democratic gerrymander of their own. “The
  state of Texas is only 40% white, but white voters control over 73% of the
  state’s congressional seats,” said Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the
  NAACP. “It’s quite obvious that Texas’s effort to redistrict mid-decade,
  before next year’s midterm elections, is racially motivated. The state’s
  intent here is to reduce the members of Congress who represent Black
  communities, and that, in and of itself, is unconstitutional.” Democrats in
  Texas promised lawsuits out of the gate. The League of United Latin American
  Citizens – a group of 13 Texas voters – filed suit within hours of the
  redistricting bill’s passage. The map “eviscerates minorities’ opportunity to
  elect their candidates of choice in four key areas of the state”, the filing
  states. Other challenges are likely to follow. Republicans, however, believe
  that they are operating on favorable legal ground, hoping to overturn key
  sections of the Voting Rights Act as the lawsuits work their way through the
  courts. The US supreme court will hear a re-argument of Louisiana v Callais in
  the term to come. In that case, the court will be asked to upend the core
  tenet of the Voting Rights Act and hold that the use of racially identifying
  voter data to prevent voters of color from being able to select a candidate of
  their choice is actually an act of racial discrimination. Without that
  protection, Republican state lawmakers across the country can be expected to
  redraw maps for increased partisan advantage by cutting Black-majority
  districts into ribbons. Meanwhile, Donald Trump said the Department of Justice
  would sue California for its redistricting. Last week, the Democratic-led
  legislature placed a measure to redraw the state’s district lines on the 4
  November ballot. In a sharp break against longstanding progressive efforts to
  turn redistricting over to neutral commissions, the NAACP said today that it
  “is urging California, New York and all other states to act immediately by
  redistricting and passing new, lawful and constitutional electoral maps” to
  counter expected efforts in Texas and other states to redraw maps for midterm
  advantage.
