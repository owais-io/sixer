  A Scottish MSP has been arrested and charged in connection with possession of
  indecent images. Colin Smyth, who has represented South Scotland since 2016,
  was arrested on Tuesday, resulting in his immediate suspension from Scottish
  Labour. He is due to appear in court at a later date. The Scottish parliament
  website now lists Smyth as an independent. A spokesperson for Police Scotland
  said: “On Tuesday 5 August 2025, officers executed a warrant at a property
  [in] Dumfries. A 52-year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with
  possession of indecent images. He is due to appear at Dumfries sheriff court
  at a later date.” A spokesperson for Scottish Labour confirmed that the whip
  had been removed from Smyth, pending an investigation. “We cannot comment
  further on this matter while the investigation is ongoing,” the spokesperson
  added. Smyth issued a statement on Wednesday, saying: “These events have come
  as a shock and this is a deeply stressful time. I am obviously cooperating
  fully with any inquiries and hope the matter can be resolved quickly. “I am
  not able to comment further at this stage, and in the meantime I would ask for
  the privacy of my family and friends to be respected.” Smyth was first elected
  as an MSP in 2016 and previously served as Scottish Labour’s general
  secretary. He nominated Anas Sarwar in the 2021 Scottish Labour leadership
  election and was later appointed spokesperson for constitution, Europe and
  external affairs.
