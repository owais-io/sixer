  Amanyanabo: The Eagle King review – a lavish Nollywood epic of crowns, gods
  and colonial tension
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-25T10:00:00Z'
bodyText: >-
  Set in the 19th-century kingdom of Okrika in the Niger delta, this Nollywood
  epic has a satisfying core of realpolitik and Kulturkampf that wouldn’t shame
  the likes of old-school classical-era equivalents such as Ben-Hur. Revolving
  around the accession to the throne of elite warrior Ibanichuka (Patrick
  Diabuah), it touches on questions of political legitimacy, politics as the art
  of the possible, the proselytisation of west Africa by Christians and – that
  still-simmering hot potato – white colonialism. One minute Ibanichuka is on
  leave for overzealously butchering enslaved people, the next the goddess
  Tamunoba anoints him in a lake as Okrika’s saviour. Though ratified by the
  elders, he is still under general suspicion for his devotion to his wife,
  Mboro, (Monalisa Chinda Coker), who is unable to bear children, and for
  generally being a soft touch. He also has a monotheism problem: the local
  priest has switched sides to Christianity, desecrating his former idols, and
  chief Ogan (Nkem Owoh) is slyly pushing the lord’s agenda in Okrika – which
  may include free trade with the British. From Ibanichuka’s mirror-fronted
  headpiece on downwards, Amanyanabo: The Eagle King has an undeniable claim to
  being the best dressed epic of all time. But its exploration of the
  responsibilities of power, often couched in prolix dialogue, does get
  ponderous. Co-directors Fred Amata and Ibinabo Fiberesima promisingly set up
  the pincer pressures of Ibanichuka’s reign: the belligerent warrior culture
  testing his strength on one side, the Christians teeming like “unbridled
  chickens” on the other. But they lose their grip on the realism needed to
  underpin the hard-nosed subject matter; the cast often lapse into vaudevillian
  acting, and the rushed staging renders a pivotal assassination attempt scene
  more like a pub car park punch-up. Ibanichuka emerges as a “middle-way”
  candidate who tries to dispense benevolence equally. But, heavily focused on
  detailing a long series of internecine rivalries, the film falls short of
  fully digging into why his character runs to self-sacrificing extremes as he
  faces down a rapacious British consul (Lucien Morgan). All the same, the
  directors conjure up the glories of Okrika culture and handle large-scale
  bloodshed with brio; this is the kind of self-confident revisionist history
  that is good news for African cinema. • Amanyanabo: The Eagle King is in UK
  cinemas from 29 August.
