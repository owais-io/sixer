  For the first time in Olympic and Paralympic history, competition venues will
  carry corporate names, breaking from the longstanding “clean venue” tradition.
  That policy, also enforced at other mega-events like the Fifa World Cup,
  requires stadiums and arenas to strip or cover all non-official sponsor
  branding, including naming rights signage. The aim is to protect the
  exclusivity of global partners who pay millions for official status. In past
  events, Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium became “Arsenal Stadium” for Uefa matches,
  and New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium will be known as “New York New Jersey
  Stadium” during the 2026 World Cup. The shift follows years of debate inside
  the IOC. Former president Thomas Bach had signaled a move towards a “clean
  field of play” rather than a blanket “clean venue” policy, opening the door
  for more sponsor visibility around the Games. LA28 chair Casey Wasserman said
  naming rights are “truly embedded” in the US sporting culture and that many
  venues are already commonly known by their sponsor names. LA28 announced
  Thursday that Comcast and Honda will be the first naming rights partners under
  an IOC-approved pilot program designed to generate additional revenue for the
  privately funded Los Angeles Games. The Comcast Squash Center at Universal
  Studios will stage squash’s Olympic debut. The Honda Center in Anaheim, home
  to the NHL’s Ducks, will host indoor volleyball while keeping its corporate
  name. Other permanent venues with existing naming deals, including SoFi
  Stadium, Intuit Dome, Crypto.com Arena, BMO Stadium, Peacock Theater and Devon
  Park in Oklahoma City, could retain their titles if their sponsors buy the
  rights. “From the moment we submitted our bid, LA28 committed to reimagining
  what’s possible for the Games,” Wasserman said. “These groundbreaking
  partnerships with Comcast and Honda, along with additional partners to come,
  will not only generate critical revenue for LA28 but will introduce a new
  commercial model to benefit the entire Movement. We’re grateful to the IOC for
  making this transformation possible.” Under the program, up to 19 temporary
  venues will also have naming rights available to worldwide and LA28 partners,
  with the first opportunities going to members of the Olympic Partner (TOP)
  program. TOP sponsors will have first choice on temporary venues, followed by
  LA28’s highest-tier domestic sponsors. Any company outside that group would
  need to sign on as a founding partner to gain rights. Wasserman has estimated
  the total value could reach nine figures, depending on the venue and location.
  Historically, the “clean venue” policies have meant significant losses for
  venue sponsors. Marketing analysts estimate that losing naming rights exposure
  at a World Cup can cost between $5m and $9m for early matches, rising to $80m
  for the final. For 2026, Fifa has told host cities to hand over full control
  of their stadiums for more than a month, with all non-sponsor logos removed or
  covered, even on equipment and roof signage. An IOC statement described the
  LA28 plan as a “pilot” that will be “assessed for relevancy for future hosts”.
  It said the approach “takes into account market realities of venue naming and
  generates critical revenue to stage the Games” while maintaining the
  principles of clean venues on the field of play. The move underscores the
  growing commercialization of the Games as organizers seek new funding models.
  LA28 will be the first US Summer Olympics in more than 30 years and aims to
  rely entirely on private financing to meet its estimated $7.1bn budget.
  Outside the new naming rights program, standard clean venue rules will still
  apply. The Games run from 14 to 30 July, followed by the Paralympics from 15
  to 27 August.
