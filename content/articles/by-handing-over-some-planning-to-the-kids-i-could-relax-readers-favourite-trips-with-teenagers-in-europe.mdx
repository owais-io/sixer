  Slovenia’s raft of adventure activities Slovenia! We started in Lake Bled.
  Teens loved the Dolinka ziplines, the summer toboggan run, hiking in Vintgar
  gorge and swimming in Lake Bled. You can hire paddleboards and boats. If you
  have the money, there is rafting and canyoning too. After seeing the
  incredible Postojna cave, we went up the Vogel cable by Lake Bohinj.
  Half-board at the Bohinj Eco hotel kept the teens amply fed and it also has an
  aquapark, bowling and plenty of games to boot. We finished the trip off with
  shopping in Ljubljana and the best ice-cream ever at Romantika. Three happy
  teenagers. Sue All aboard in the Netherlands Our favourite family holiday was
  to the Netherlands: taking turns playing captain guiding electric hire boats
  on canals; tilting our ice-cream cones at windmills at Zaanse Schans; cycling
  to the broad, clean beaches for mocktails in cabanas; Amsterdam for the
  colourful Pride parade counterpointed by a quiet, calming visit to De
  Poezenboot (which teen could resist a cat sanctuary on a canal boat?). And
  staying in Haarlem in an apartment with speedy wifi kept the teens happy while
  we indulged in morning strolls through medieval cobbled streets to Grote Markt
  for coffee and people-watching. Annette An Italian castle at hostel prices
  When I saw the picture of Ostello il Castello di Santa Severa in the Guardian
  in 2019, I thought it was too good to be true, but it’s genuine. We have been
  twice with our teens, and sent friends too! A mile-long beach where teenagers
  can roam and paddleboard, an easy train journey to explore Rome, lunchtime
  pizza slices with locals cheering on the footie at L’Angolo delle Crepes. Plus
  the opportunity to sleep in a castle at hostel prices. Fluffy white towels
  aplenty, but also a gleaming kitchen if you want to cook. Don’t miss the
  nearby necropolis for an Indiana Jones-style adventure. Fireworks over the
  castle and a hilarious Italian Beatles cover band were the ciliegina sulla
  torta! Margaret Dracula and bear-spotting in Romania The best European trip
  with my teen (so far) has to be Romania. We stayed in Brașov, booked an
  apartment with a pool and had the best time. There is so much to do and lots
  of easy public transport. We ate outdoors at little cafes on the street, took
  a cable car up the mountain, went on a trip to see bears in the forest (up
  close and personal!), had a tree-top adventure at Adventure Park and visited
  Dracula’s castle. The town itself is historic and beautiful, and the people
  are so welcoming. It’s not your typical British tourist destination but it
  makes for a fabulous adventure. Kate When in Rome … take a Vespa tour! Rome in
  October half-term. Coliseum and Forum tours gave the right balance of
  interesting history, fun facts and a bit of gore that most teenagers would be
  entranced by! Walked a lot without seeming to walk a lot. A two-hour Vespa
  tour was the highlight. You hang on to the drivers and they negotiate the
  traffic, show you a different Rome with local knowledge and attitude. To
  complete the adventure: guaranteed great food, gelato and, for weary parents
  of an evening, vino cheapo! Ruth Austria’s Alpine summer wonderland
  Saalbach-Hinterglemm in Austria in the summer meant hiking, ebiking and
  waterparks. Take advantage of the Joker card for free or reduced-price access
  to lots of activities. Hire a car to make the most of local resorts with
  lakeside beach clubs, alpine zoos, glacier visits and summer toboggan runs.
  Plenty to keep teens entertained. Hilary An epic train journey across Europe
  Last summer I went with my two children on a trip north through Scandinavia,
  then back via the Baltic countries. This turned into an epic 5,000-mile train
  journey, which we each took part in planning. The 10-year-old’s focus was on
  cycling, swimming, play parks and cat cafes. The 14-year-old took us to the
  KGB headquarters in Riga, a tour around Berlin, and a visit to the Deyrolle
  taxidermy shop in Paris. By handing over some planning and responsibility to
  the kids, I could relax; they were engaged in activities away from their
  devices and their geography knowledge improved! Sarah Patel Cosmopolitan and
  exotic Antwerp Antwerp by Eurostar was perfect. Coffee and buns at Pakt every
  morning, cool galleries like MoMu and Fomu every day, kilo vintage shopping,
  art nouveau streets, incredible Korean, Vietnamese and Nepalese restaurants,
  and bikes! Perfect October break. Georgia Postcard from the edge of
  Belleville, Paris A brief holiday for us this year with our 15-year-old son
  but it was plenty – five nights in a gorgeous apartment on the edge of
  Belleville, Paris, not far from Buttes-Chaumont. He’s the age where we can
  enjoy both Disneyland and then take in the Hockney retrospective at the
  stunning Fondation Louis Vuitton. Back at base we watched city life unfold
  from our French windows and then sampled Lebanese, Laos and French meals in
  the bustling streets around. Nearer to town, the family-run Eats Thyme is a
  standout. GingerGigolo Winning tip: Oompah and cable cars in Bavaria A
  two-centre holiday to Munich and Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria, Germany,
  is a must with teenagers as there is so much to see and do. In Munich they
  loved the atmosphere in the beer halls – eating pretzels and listening to the
  oompah band and watching the Rathaus-Glockenspiel in the square. A visit to
  the Olympiapark is also recommended. In Garmisch-Partenkirchen there is a
  toboggan run, which is great fun, and nearby is the beautiful Zugspitze
  mountain and cable car, with boating on Eibsee lake. Bavaria has plenty to
  keep teenagers entertained and active, for a very enjoyable holiday. Richard
