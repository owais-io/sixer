  Rubén Ramírez is no stranger to political battles. As a community leader in
  Santa Úrsula Coapa, a district in southern Mexico City, he’s become adept at
  taking on developers and bureaucrats to protect his neighbourhood over the
  past decade. His latest fight may be his most ambitious yet: challenging the
  expansion of Mexico City’s national stadium ahead of the 2026 football World
  Cup, which he claims neglects the community’s ancient rights. “The stadium is
  part of the community’s territory,” says Ramírez, sporting a wide-set
  sombrero. “It’s the owners, the businesspeople who are going to benefit from
  the World Cup. What are the community going to see? Nothing.” Mexico’s
  national Azteca Stadium – the largest in Latin America – is a sprawling
  complex. In June next year, it will host the opening match of the 2026 World
  Cup, a tournament split between Mexico, Canada and the US. The stadium’s
  perimeter will be expanded to include new shopping and leisure centres, and
  there will be renovation of the Azteca itself. But about 200,000 people live
  in the stadium’s shadows. They include Indigenous and native people, as well
  as the Santa Úrsula Coapa community, located just a stone’s throw from the
  main entrance. These individuals, many living in poverty, are quietly being
  affected by the World Cup plans, according to Ramírez. Chief among grievances
  is water – or the lack of it. The community’s water supply already experiences
  regular outages, and residents say it will be further threatened by stadium
  expansion due to increased demand. “We think the World Cup is going to magnify
  the problems, including the water shortage,” says Natalia Lara, an
  environmentalist and teacher. Water shortages are common across Mexico City,
  where ageing infrastructure loses an estimated 30-40% of supply and rapid
  population growth has caused demand to outstrip the locally available
  renewable freshwater resources. Many neighbourhoods routinely face rationing
  or water truck deliveries, especially in poorer areas. In the Azteca district,
  residents say the plight worsened in 2018 when a neighbouring well was
  privatised by Televisa – a Mexican telecoms company, which also partly owns
  the Azteca stadium. The Santa Úrsula community says this contract was illegal
  and has contributed to over-exploitation, with extraction now required at a
  depth of 400 metres against the original 80 metres. On 1 May, Lara was
  arrested alongside a colleague while protesting against the World Cup stadium
  expansion. The arrest was captured in a video widely shared on social media.
  The charges were quickly dropped, but she says her arrest was part of a wider
  trend to silence protesters. Lara says: “It was a political abuse. It was
  totally arbitrary.” The office of Mexico City’s mayor, Clara Brugada, did not
  reply to a request for comment. However, during a community visit in May after
  protests, Brugada seemed to acknowledge the problem. Quoted by local media,
  she said Mexico could not be “hosting a World Cup if next to the great Azteca
  stadium we have a lack of water, flooding or other kinds of problems”.
  Activists say no action has been taken since the meetings. They continue to
  send letters to government officials, accusing them of being in Fifa’s
  pockets. Their central plea is for the private concession, which extracts 450m
  litres of water annually, to be withdrawn. A spokesperson for the Televisa
  spinoff, Grupo Ollamani, said they “work very closely with the surrounding
  communities” and work with “the local government in order to alleviate their
  needs.” However, even activists like Lara want to celebrate the World Cup – as
  long as officials put people first. There is palpable excitement in this
  nation of football fanatics that Mexico will host the international tournament
  for the third time. “We’re not against the World Cup,” says Lara. “What we’re
  asking for is management of public spaces that’s not just for generating
  profits for private companies.” She says the problem is “how the environmental
  and social impact of these events” is handled. *** John Horne, a retired
  British professor of sport and sociology, has studied mega-events like the
  World Cup. His research found that these spectacles often involve the
  “routinisation of harm to local populations”, with the diversion of critical
  urban resources a key factor. His study also showed that the much-cited
  benefits of mega-events are often spread highly unevenly and the occasions
  frequently fail to deliver promised legacies, with notorious examples
  including South Africa’s staging of the 2010 Fifa World Cup. The Mexican
  government estimates the World Cup will see up to a $7bn (£5.2bn) injection
  into the country. The capital alone expects to invest $250m (£190m) in
  infrastructure, along with promising jobs and improved services. Economic
  advancement would be welcome for communities surrounding the stadium, which
  are generally not well off. The average monthly income in a Santa Úrsula
  household is 18,900 Mexican pesos (£750), below the city average of 22,200
  pesos. It may be a good sign that house prices in the area have risen above
  average, in anticipation of the games. Yet Lara suspects residents will see
  little economic benefit from the World Cup – at best, small earnings from
  charging for parking or selling drinks. Worse, rental prices are likely to
  rise. She says: “We’re going to get a tiny slice.” Ramírez has seen this
  before – stretching back to when the Azteca was constructed in the 1960s.
  Since then, life for the community has become nearly unbearable on match days,
  with extreme traffic congestion, resource depletion and noise pollution. He’s
  already lived through previous World Cups. Though smaller in scale, he says
  they brought little positive change and worries that promises of
  infrastructure improvement to the immediate area is a distraction from the
  underlying issues. *** For the Santa Úrsula community, the fight to be heard
  is deeply rooted in history. The constitution stipulates that authorities must
  legally consult local communities and leaders such as Ramírez when
  constructing on Indigenous land. They have failed to do so adequately, he
  argues. “We have a right to consultation,” he says. “They’re ignoring us
  completely. We don’t know anything.” The plans, he says, were publicly
  announced without prior consultation. Worse, other projects are being touted
  to take advantage of the World Cup buzz – including a dinosaur theme park. One
  proposed site is a 5,000 sq metre (55,000 sq ft) forest area inside Santa
  Úrsula that residents have protected for decades. “They can’t take it, this is
  the lungs of the community,” says Ramírez. “Why do they have to build it here?
  Take it somewhere else.” If redevelopment occurs, families will lose homes to
  make way for lorries. The community will lose its main green space. Lara adds
  that the World Cup is being used to justify wider urbanisation plans and
  “gentrification” without regard for environmental and social challenges. Legal
  protections technically exist to prevent the urban forest’s destruction, but
  the government has failed to give solid assurances that communities will be
  spared construction. Developers continue to visit the site, and Televisa’s
  longstanding plans for a large luxury residential project nearby remain under
  discussion. For Ramírez, it’s a reminder of inherent tensions with development
  and how Indigenous rights remain sidelined. “I’m not against development,” he
  says. “I’m just advocating that things get done the right way, and as the law
  dictates. “How is it possible that they have a first-class stadium, and next
  to it, a town that’s dead?”
