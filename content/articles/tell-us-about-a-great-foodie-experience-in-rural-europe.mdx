  the continent for decades. We’d love to hear about your favourite rural food

  farmer’s market in France, or joining the festivities as the locals celebrate
  their favourite delicacy coming into season. The best tip of the week, chosen
  by Tom Hall of Lonely Planet wins a £200 voucher to stay at a Coolstays
  property – the company has more than 3,000 worldwide. The best tips will
  appear in the Guardian Travel section and website. Keep your tip to about 100
  words If you have a relevant photo, do send it in – but it’s your words we
  will be judging for the competition. We’re sorry, but for legal reasons you
