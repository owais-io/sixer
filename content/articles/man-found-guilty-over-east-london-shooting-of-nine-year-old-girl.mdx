  A man has been found guilty for his role in the shooting of a nine-year-old
  girl outside an east London restaurant in a long-running gang feud. The girl
  was hit in the head by one of six bullets fired by a man on a passing
  motorbike as she sat with her family in the Evin restaurant in Kingsland High
  Street, Hackney, on 29 May last year. The gunman has not been caught, but
  jurors were told Javon Riley played a “key role” before, during and after the
  shooting. He carried out reconnaissance of the restaurant before the attack,
  scouted for potential targets and drove the gunman away in a stolen car, which
  was later found burnt out. On Monday, Riley, 33, from Tottenham, north London,
  was found guilty of causing grievous harm with intent to the nine-year-old
  girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons. The child was a victim of a
  bloody rivalry between Turkish gangs of north London, while three men who were
  sitting at a nearby table were also struck and injured, the Old Bailey was
  told. Riley was also found guilty of attempting to murder Mustafa Kiziltan,
  35, Kenan Aydogdu, 45 and Nasser Ali, 44. The three men were said to be
  affiliated with the Hackney Turks organised crime gang, who had a rivalry with
  the Tottenham Turks, with whom Riley had links, the court heard. The court was
  told that Aydogdu had been injured in a previous shooting. The Old Bailey jury
  deliberated for six hours and three minutes to convict Riley by a majority of
  10 to two. Judge Mark Lucraft KC remanded Riley into custody to be sentenced
  on 12 September. He told Riley to expect a lengthy prison sentence, saying:
  “You have clearly taken part in a shooting which has led to four people being
  injured, one of them particularly seriously.” The nine-year-old girl spent
  three months in hospital and will have lifelong physical and cognitive
  problems as the bullet remains lodged in her brain. The three male victims
  received gunshot wounds to the arm, leg and thigh. In a statement, the girl’s
  mother said: “In a single moment, the future we had imagined for our daughter
  was torn away. “She was once an energetic, adventurous child – everything that
  celebrated movement, energy and life. “Now, weakness on her left side means
  she can only watch from the sidelines, living with a titanium plate in her
  skull and a bullet still in her brain. “As parents, we are shattered:
  emotionally, physically, mentally and financially. “Each day brings new
  challenges, from her slower growth on one side to the emotional and mental
  scars that cannot be seen.” During the three-week trial, Riley was repeatedly
  asked to identify the “third party” who had recruited him for about £40,000.
  He refused to name them or help to identify the gunman, claiming he feared for
  his life and those of his family. Scotland Yard has offered a reward of up to
  £15,000 for information that leads to the identification, arrest of and
  prosecution the man who fired the weapon. The court heard that Jamaica-born
  Riley had a string of convictions dating back to 2008 including for possession
  of cannabis and cocaine, driving offences and having an offensive weapon and a
  blade in his car.
