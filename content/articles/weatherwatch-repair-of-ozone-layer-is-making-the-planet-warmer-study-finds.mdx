  The repair of the Earth’s ozone layer has been a success, but a new study
  reveals a downside: ozone is warming the planet up to 40% more than originally
  anticipated. Bill Collins from the University of Reading and his colleagues
  used a computer model to project the amount of warming associated with changes
  in ozone between 2015 and 2050, taking into account changes in humidity,
  clouds and surface reflectivity. If we continue to implement the air pollution
  controls mandated by the Montreal protocol in 1987 their results, which are
  published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, suggest that the healing of
  the ozone layer will create more warming, cancelling out most of the climate
  benefits from stopping production of ozone destroying chemicals such as CFCs
  and HCFCs. By 2050 they estimate that ozone will be the second-largest
  contributor to warming after carbon dioxide. The researchers stress that
  repairing the ozone layer is still the right thing to do and brings vital
  health benefits; protecting people, animals and plants from dangerous
  ultraviolet radiation. Some of the additional warming effect can be mitigated
  by reducing air pollution associated with ozone formation near to the ground.
  However, climate policies need to be revised to take into account the
  unavoidable extra warming associated with ozone layer repair.
