  Elon Musk and his social media platform, X, reached a tentative settlement on
  Wednesday with former Twitter employees after a years-long legal battle over
  severance pay. Former staff had sought $500m in a proposed class action suit
  against the billionaire. A court filing released on Wednesday stated that both
  parties had reached a settlement agreement in principle and requested that a
  scheduled 17 September hearing in the case be postponed while they worked to
  finalize a deal. The filing did not disclose any details of the tentative
  agreement and it is unclear what level of compensation that former employees
  may receive. Former Twitter employees, led by Courtney McMillian and Ronald
  Cooper, alleged that the company failed to appropriately pay thousands of
  workers severance after conducting mass layoffs. When Musk acquired Twitter in
  2022, he cut more than 6,000 employees in an overhaul of the company’s
  workforce, slashing almost the entirety of departments such as content
  moderation and communications. The layoffs led to several lawsuits, some
  ongoing, from staff and executives, and foreshadowed how Musk’s “department of
  government efficiency” would approach its gutting of government agencies
  earlier this year. The lawsuit alleged that laid-off workers were owed at
  least two months of pay plus additional compensation depending on their time
  worked at the company, in accordance with a 2019 severance plan. Instead, Musk
  failed to honor the contract and in some cases paid workers no compensation at
  all, according to the suit. The tentative settlement is a turnaround from last
  year, when a US district judge dismissed McMillian’s suit in a legal victory
  for Musk. Judge Trina Thompson ruled last July that the federal Employee
  Retirement Income Security Act (Erisa) governing benefit plans did not cover
  the former employees’ claims, forcing the plaintiffs to appeal the decision to
  a higher court. Musk’s $44bn acquisition of Twitter, which he subsequently
  rebranded to X, remains an incredibly contentious business deal. Twitter
  executives, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, are also suing Musk in a
  separate, still-pending case over allegations that he failed to pay them $128m
  in severance.
