  Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine could not agree to a Russian proposal to
  give up more of his country’s territory in exchange for a ceasefire because
  Moscow would use what it gained as a springboard to start a future war. The
  Ukrainian president said he did not believe that Donald Trump supported
  Russia’s demands, and he expressed hope the US leader would act as an honest
  mediator when he meets Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. He added there was
  no sign that Russia was preparing to implement a ceasefire, as reports emerged
  that small sabotage groups had pierced Ukrainian defences in the eastern
  Donbas, advancing about six miles in three days. Zelenskyy also warned that
  Russia was planning new offensives on three parts of the frontline. Speaking
  to journalists in the run-up to the Trump-Putin summit, and a day before a
  virtual meeting with US and European leaders, Zelenskyy said he believed Putin
  wanted to dominate his country because he “does not want a sovereign Ukraine”.
  It was therefore dangerous, Zelenskyy said, for Ukraine to be forced by the US
  into accepting Russia’s demand to take over the parts of Donbas it does not
  control after the Alaska summit. The region sought by Russia amounted to
  “about 90,000 square kilometres” of the country, he said. Last week Russia
  indicated it was prepared to consider a ceasefire in the Ukraine war for the
  first time, in exchange for Ukraine withdrawing from the parts of Donbas it
  still controlled. Though Trump then suggested that Russia and Ukraine could
  engage in some “swapping of territories”, Zelenskyy said he understood that
  Russia was “simply offering not to advance further, not to withdraw from
  anywhere” and that swaps were not on the table. “We will not leave Donbas. We
  cannot do it,” Zelenskyy said. “For Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a
  future new offensive.” The region demanded by Russia was too strategically
  important to give up, he said, because it was a heavily fortified area that
  protected Ukraine’s central cities. “I have heard nothing – not a single
  proposal – that would guarantee that a new war will not start tomorrow and
  that Putin will not try to occupy at least Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv”
  once Russia had gained all of Donbas, Zelenskyy said. Ukraine’s leader said he
  wanted Putin instead to agree to a ceasefire on the current frontlines and for
  both sides to return all prisoners of war and missing children, before any
  discussion about territory and the future security of the country. “Any
  question of territory cannot be separated from security guarantees,” he said.
  Zelenskyy said he would not be at the summit in Alaska, the first face-to-face
  meeting between Trump and Putin with both in office since 2018. But he said he
  hoped it would be followed by “a trilateral meeting” with Trump and Putin,
  though the Russian leader has so far said he is not willing to meet Zelenskyy.
  The Ukrainian leader also expressed faith in the unpredictable Trump, who he
  said could act as an honest broker between himself and Putin. “I do not
  believe that Putin’s proposal is Trump’s proposal,” he said. “I believe that
  Trump represents the United States of America. He is acting as a mediator – he
  is in the middle, not on Russia’s side. Let him not be on our side but in the
  middle.” He said he did not know what exactly Putin and Trump were going to
  discuss in Alaska, saying “probably there is a bilateral track” of talks about
  other topics of mutual interest, such as trade, sanctions and business. But he
  said Putin had scored a diplomatic win in securing the meeting: “He is
  seeking, excuse me, photographs. He needs a photo of his meeting with
  President Trump.” Zelenskyy said Russia was desperately trying to show it was
  winning the war and that the Kremlin wanted “to create a certain narrative,
  especially in the American media, that Russia is moving forward and Ukraine is
  losing” by mounting sabotage attacks in the Donbas region. He acknowledged
  that “groups of Russians advanced about 10 kilometres in several places”
  although he said: “They have no equipment, only weapons in their hands,” and
  said that some had already been killed or captured. But the breach is
  ill-timed from Ukraine’s point of view. In Alaska, Putin is likely to tell
  Trump that such successes show that Russia is gradually winning the three-year
  war in the east, and so US future support for Kyiv will be wasted. War maps
  showed two lines of advance east of the town of Dobropillya, and gains of
  about six miles since Friday. Experts said the next few days would be critical
  to see if Ukraine could contain the break in the front. Ukraine’s military
  said Russia had concentrated about 110,000 troops in the sector and that the
  invaders were “brazenly attempting to infiltrate our defensive lines with
  sabotage and small infantry groups, regardless of their losses”. The military
  command said in a social media post that reserves had been deployed at the
  order of Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, Ukraine’s chief military commander, in an
  effort to restore the frontlines. The Institute for the Study of War said
  Russian “sabotage and reconnaissance groups” had infiltrated Ukrainian-held
  territory near Dobropillya, a key supply point in the west of the Donetsk
  region. “It is premature to call the Russian advances in the Dobropillya area
  an operational-level breakthrough,” the ISW said on Monday night. It said the
  invaders would now try to turn “tactical advances” into something more
  significant. Russia is taking heavy casualties of about 1,000 a day, with 500
  killed and 500 wounded on Monday, Zelenskyy said, as it relies heavily on
  infantry assaults to break Kyiv’s defensive lines. Zelenskyy said Ukraine’s
  casualties on the same day were much smaller – a total of 340 – “18 killed and
  243 wounded, with 79 missing in action”. But in the past when Moscow’s forces
  have broken through, Ukraine has frequently proved unable to push them back. A
  former senior Ukrainian army officer, Bohdan Krotevych, said the piercing of
  Ukraine’s lines had come about because “instead of reinforcing defensive units
  with infantry”, senior commanders in Kyiv had prioritised deploying newly
  mobilised soldiers into assault forces, leaving units already on the frontline
  weakened. “To stabilise the front, we must reinforce brigades on the line of
  contact with infantry,” Krotevych said, and he called for Ukraine to urgently
  strengthen its reserve forces and adopt a defensive strategy rather than try
  to counter high-risk Russian infantry assaults with its own. Dobropillya is a
  key supply point for the beleaguered towns of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad to the
  south and the principal cities of Ukrainian-held Donbas to the east from the
  centre of the country. Zelenskyy said Russia was preparing a fresh offensive
  in the autumn involving nearly 30,000 troops moved from Sumy, in the
  north-east of Ukraine, “in three directions” on the frontline – towards
  Zaporizhzhia in the south and Pokrovsk and the nearby Novopavlika in the
  south-east.
