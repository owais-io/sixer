  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 4th (NB: this is not necessarily Tom
  Garry’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 3rd Prospects Manchester United are embarking on what they hope will
  be a historic season for the club that could see them taking part in their
  first European group stage campaign, if they can overcome the tricky hurdle of
  facing the current Norwegian league leaders, Brann, first and foremost. The
  excitement of potential first meetings with sides such as Barcelona looms
  large. However, if Marc Skinner’s team are going to be able to be competitive
  both domestically and on the continent, and juggle those extra demands, it is
  fair to say their squad currently looks low on depth. They are entering the
  final few days of the transfer window with just two new signings secured. Both
  of them are Sweden internationals of significant quality, with a multiple
  former Champions League winner in Fridolina Rolfö arriving from Barcelona and
  the midfielder Julia Zigiotti Olme having been snapped up from Bayern Munich
  for an undisclosed fee. Yet the squad still looked fairly thin during the
  Champions League second qualifying round fixtures in Sweden and they are
  understood to still be searching for at least a defender and a forward. The
  club have not had the spending power of their rivals this summer, again, and
  there remains a gap to Arsenal and Chelsea. United have said previously they
  want to run the team in an economically sustainable way, but it will frustrate
  their supporters to see their rivals for major trophies investing more on
  players. That said, United still have a strong starting side and a defensive
  record to be proud of – only Chelsea conceded fewer goals in the WSL last
  season – and they have a world-class goalkeeper, coupled with a well-organised
  back four. They should expect to be competitive at the top of the table but
  staying in the top three could be tough. The manager Marc Skinner is the
  longest-serving current manager in the WSL, having been in charge since the
  summer of 2021, and in April this year he signed a new contract to extend his
  stay at United until 2027, with the option of a further year. It is fair to
  say the former Orlando Pride and Birmingham City head coach divides opinion
  among some sections of the fanbase but he has led the team to three
  consecutive FA Cup finals, overseeing victory in the second of those three in
  2024 to see the club lift their first major women’s silverware. Off-field
  picture Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s absence from May’s FA Cup final at Wembley for a
  second year in a row did not exactly give off the impression of an ownership
  group being deeply and emotionally invested in the fortunes of the women’s
  team, and he made it fairly clear during interviews last year that the women’s
  side was not his priority. Nonetheless, there is understood to be a close
  alignment between the women’s side and the director of football, Jason Wilcox,
  and – while there is still clearly a significant gap in their funding compared
  to Arsenal and Chelsea – there have been improvements in unity since the
  Glazers relinquished control. Star signing Both of United’s summer arrivals so
  far have star quality but it is the acquisition of Rolfö from the Spanish
  champions Barcelona that has really caught the eye and she could be an
  outstanding addition to the English league generally, let alone to Manchester
  United. A powerful, athletic left-sided player who can play as a left-back, a
  wing-back or as a winger in a front three, the player capped 101 times by
  Sweden will be a formidable sight for right-backs across the league and, even
  aged 31, has the potential to be one of the division’s signings of the summer.
  Stepping up Having joined the club from the Swedish outfit Häcken in August
  2024 and then needing to be patient for her chances last term, the left-back
  Anna Sandberg now looks ready to move up into regular first-team contention.
  She started both of the team’s Champions League qualifying victories in
  Stockholm in August, both of which saw the team keep clean sheets. The
  22-year-old Sweden international is an attacking full-back and demonstrated
  this with her crossing ability and her impactful runs down the left flank
  against PSV in particular, and she still has the potential to get better. It
  was a good summer for … Manchester United’s England trio of Ella Toone, Grace
  Clinton and Maya Le Tissier all had a summer to remember with the Lionesses in
  Switzerland. Since the club regrouped for pre-season, it has been a great
  start for the Norway striker Elisabeth Terland, who scored four times in two
  games to help United progress through their semi-final and final in the
  Champions League second qualifying phase. Toone was also in good form in those
  two fixtures in Stockholm, providing two assists for Terland’s hat-trick
  against PSV. Main initiative to attract more fans The club are currently set
  to play at Old Trafford twice this term, for their home games against Aston
  Villa in November and against Manchester City in March, while Leigh Sports
  Village is their regular home. The Manchester United women’s official
  supporters club have a songbook, which they have made available for fans on
  their website, to try and encourage more spectators to sing along. It includes
  everything from a classic from the Disney film The Little Mermaid, which has
  been rewritten for their goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce, to a twist on Proud
  Mary that refers to “rollin’ on a [Jayde] Riviere”.
