  The fertility rate for England and Wales has fallen for the third year in a
  row to reach a record low, figures show. The total fertility rate across both
  nations, meaning the average number of live children women can expect to have
  across their child-bearing life, stood at 1.41 in 2024, down from 1.42 in
  2023, the lowest since comparable data was first collected in 1938, according
  to the Office for National Statistics. This is despite a 0.6% increase in live
  births last year, with a 14% increase in babies born to fathers over 60,
  according to figures published last month. For a country’s population to
  remain stable over time – discounting any impact from migration – the total
  fertility rate needs to be about 2.1. The disparity is down to the fact the
  adult population increased in 2024, which outweighed the increase in births.
  Since 1938, an increase in births at the same time as a decrease in the
  fertility rate has only been observed six times, with four occurring since
  2011. Greg Ceely, head of population health monitoring at the Office for
  National Statistics, said: “Fertility rates in England and Wales have been in
  overall decline since 2010. The total number of births increased last year,
  for the first time since 2021; but this was offset by population growth. As a
  result, fertility rates fell overall, and are now at the lowest rates on
  record.” The stats also showed that the long-term trend of the average age of
  parents rising steadily over the past 50 years is continuing: the average age
  of mothers and fathers both increased by 0.1 years in 2024, with mothers aged
  31 and fathers 33.9, according to the ONS’ annual Births in England and Wales
  publication. Over the last two decades, the average age of mothers and fathers
  has increased by two years for mothers, and just under two years for fathers.
  Mothers living in London had the highest mean age across all English regions
  and Wales at 32.5 years in 2024, compared with the lowest in the north-east,
  at 30. In 2024, the average age of mothers in England and Wales having their
  first born (29.4) was noticeably lower than those having later-born children
  (31.8 for second, 32.9 for third, and 33.9 for fourth), suggesting that
  mothers tend to leave larger gaps between their first and second children than
  for subsequent children. When broken down by age group, the fertility rate for
  the age group 25 to 29 has decreased the most for both mothers and fathers,
  although there were falls for all under-30s. Conversely, it increased for
  mothers between 30 and 39, and for fathers it increased between 35 and 39 and
  decreased between 30 and 34. There were also notable increases for older
  fathers, with the fertility rate increasing for those over 60 and those aged
  50-54, although it fell slightly for fathers in their 40s. The stats also shed
  light on regional disparities. Two regions experienced an increase in the
  fertility rate, representing the first regional increases since 2021: the West
  Midlands increased from 1.56 in 2023 to 1.59 in 2024, and London increased
  from 1.33 in 2023 to 1.35 in 2024. The north-west experienced no change and
  all other regions recorded declines. Luton was the area with the highest
  fertility rate at 2, while the City of London’s was the lowest at 0.32.
  Politicians have been voicing concerns about the falling birthrate recently,
  in particular over the question of how a decreasing number of people of
  working age can support an ever-increasing number of pensioners. In July, the
  education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the falling birthrate had
  “worrying repercussions” and that she hoped to be able to make it easier for
  women to have children.
