  Ukraine has hit a key pumping station on the Druzhba oil pipeline bringing
  fuel to Europe from Russia, knocking out supplies to Hungary and Slovakia, the
  only remaining EU member states still receiving Russian oil. As Ukraine
  targets infrastructure crucial to Moscow’s war effort in response to the
  Russian onslaught, the commander of Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces, Robert
  Brovdi, announced the attack on the Unecha pumping station in the Bryansk
  region. Bryansk’s premier, Alexander Bogomaz, said in a Telegram post that
  Ukraine fired Himars rockets and drones at the region in a combined attack.
  The Hungarian and Slovakian governments wrote to the European Commission, the
  EU executive, saying that Russian oil supplies could be suspended for at least
  five days owing to the damage. “The physical and geographical reality is that
  without this pipeline, the safe supply of our countries is simply not
  possible,” their foreign ministers, Péter Szijjártó and Juraj Blanár, said in
  a letter. The Ukrainian strike drew an angry reaction from Budapest, which
  gets more than half its crude oil from the Druzhba pipeline. Szijjártó wrote
  on Facebook it had been attacked “for the third time in a short time”. “This
  is another attack on the energy security of our country. Another attempt to
  drag us into war,” he said. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has
  refused to join EU partners in backing Kyiv with political, economic and
  military support. Orbán visited Moscow last year for talks with the country’s
  president, Vladimir Putin, on a rare trip to Russia by a European leader. On
  Friday, Orbán’s Fidesz party posted a note from its leader condemning
  Ukrainian strikes on the pipeline earlier in the week “just before the
  historic meeting between President Trump and Putin in Alaska”. “Hungary
  supports Ukraine with electricity and petrol, in return they bomb pipeline
  that supply us,” Orbán wrote in English. “Very unfriendly move! We wish
  President Trump every success in his pursuit for peace!” Below the text was a
  handwritten message apparently written and signed by Trump: “Viktor – I do not
  like hearing this – I am very angry about it. Tell Slovakia,” it read. “You
  are my great friend – Donald.” While the other 25 EU member states halted
  Russian oil purchases as part of the bloc’s sanctions after Moscow’s
  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Hungary and Slovakia have
  remained outliers. The EU aims to phase out Russian oil and gas entirely by
  the end of 2027 but Budapest and Bratislava oppose such a move, arguing that
  Russian energy supplies are vital to their national economies. Despite a push
  by Trump to reach a deal to end the conflict, the three-and-a-half-year war
  continued unabated this week as Russia launched an air attack near Ukraine’s
  border with the EU on Thursday and continued its devastating assault on
  Ukrainian cities. Ukraine has repeatedly pounded Russian oil refineries among
  other targets, sending Russian wholesale petrol prices soaring to record highs
  in recent days. Moscow routinely targets Ukraine’s gas infrastructure, crucial
  for winter heating and as fuel for essential industries. The Druzhba pipeline
  begins in Russia and transports oil through Belarus and Ukraine to Slovakia
  and Hungary. It was the second time that supplies to the EU countries were
  interrupted this week. The Soviet-era pipeline, which runs through Belarus and
  Ukraine, also ships oil from Kazakhstan to Germany but its economy ministry
  said supplies of Kazakh oil were unaffected by the latest strike. Slovakia’s
  Moscow-friendly prime minister, Robert Fico, has adopted Kremlin lines and
  sided with Orbán as a pro-Russian voice in the EU. In May, Fico shook hands
  with Putin at the Kremlin before becoming the only EU leader to attend
  Russia’s 9 May parade of military forces waging war on Ukraine. Reuters and
