  The president of Argentina, Javier Milei, has been pelted with stones while
  campaigning near the capital Buenos Aires by demonstrators protesting about
  allegations of corruption involving his influential sister. The far-right
  leader, who was whisked from the scene by his security detail, sustained no
  injuries after his motorcade was attacked, presidential spokesperson Manuel
  Adorni wrote on X. As Argentina prepares for legislative elections in October,
  Milei’s campaigning has been overshadowed by his administration’s worst
  alleged corruption scandal . For more than a week, the country’s news agenda
  has been dominated by the repercussions of leaked audio recordings in which a
  former government official can be heard discussing the alleged payment of
  bribes linked to the purchase of medicines for people with disabilities. In
  the recordings, Diego Spagnuolo, head of the National Disability Agency and a
  former Milei lawyer, claimed that Milei’s powerful sister, Karina Milei,
  pocketed 3% from each contract. On Wednesday, Milei and his sister were riding
  in the back of a pickup truck and greeting supporters in Lomas de Zamora, 20km
  (12 miles) south of Buenos Aires, when protesters began throwing plants, rocks
  and bottles at their vehicle. The vehicle quickly left the scene. Afterwards,
  scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the libertarian leader.
  Shortly afterwards, Milei posted on his social media a photo showing a stone
  flying just above his head, accompanied by the words: “CIVILISATION OR
  BARBARISM. KIRCHNERISMO NEVER AGAIN,” a reference to the opposition led by
  former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. The justice minister,
  Patricia Bullrich, wrote on her social media that the attack had been
  organised by Fernández’s supporters. But others suggested that the
  stone-throwing was a reaction to the alleged corruption scandal. Minutes after
  the incident, the Buenos Aires governor, Axel Kicillof, a former economy
  minister under Kirchner, said at another campaign event: “Milei, the people
  have already seen through you: fraudster, liar” – though he did not mention
  the stone-throwing. Shortly before the attack, Milei broke his silence on the
  corruption allegations, telling reporters: “Everything [Spagnuolo] says is a
  lie … We are going to bring him to justice and prove he lied,” referring to
  the man who, according to Argentine media, was once close to Milei and a
  frequent visitor to the Casa Rosada. Karina Milei has not addressed the
  allegations. The president’s sister assumed the post of secretary general of
  the presidency after Milei scrapped a decree barring relatives from public
  office, and she is widely seen as the “chief architect” behind her brother’s
  rise to power. Known as El Jefe (the male boss) by insiders including the
  president himself, Karina Milei is said to decide his agenda, political
  alliances and which journalists he will or will not speak to. The scandal
  allegations, which public prosecutors are investigating, represent what could
  be a major threat for Milei in the run-up to the provincial legislative
  elections in Buenos Aires – which account for almost 40% of the electorate –
  on 7 September, and the national elections on 26 October. The vote will be the
  first big test of his support since the libertarian economist took office in
  December 2023 on a promise to revive Argentina’s ailing economy. Lara Goyburu,
  a political scientist and executive director at the consulting firm Management
  &amp; Fit, said the scandal could affect voter turnout because it appears
  closer to the “old-fashioned corruption” Milei had promised to fight.
