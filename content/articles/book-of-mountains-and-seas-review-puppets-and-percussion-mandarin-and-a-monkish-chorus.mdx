  There’s no doubting composer Huang Ruo and director Basil Twist’s ambition in
  Book of Mountains and Seas. Over 75 minutes, using six puppeteers, two
  percussionists and a choir of 12 – the excellent Ars Nova Copenhagen – they
  aim to create the world before our very eyes before nearly destroying it,
  twice. And all by manipulating some lanterns, a few swathes of silk and a
  handful of fragments reminiscent of flotsam. The action is measured, the sound
  world haunting, and the visuals, nimbly lit by Ayumu “Poe” Saegusa, are
  effective, but it does take a while to get going. Ruo, who was born in China
  and lives in the US, writes assured, distinctive music, fusing east and west
  in a way that feels natural and authentic. Here, he deploys an array of tuned
  and untuned percussion instruments, some of them used in traditional Chinese
  orchestras, but most familiar to western ears. Gongs, finger cymbals, marimba
  and Tibetan singing bowls put in appearances, yet all are used sparingly.
  Vocally, too, there’s a certain austerity, whether in sober chant or rhythmic
  chatter. Melismatic melodies and ululating choruses lend cross-cultural spice
  to Ruo’s musical melting pot. The work tells four tales drawn from Chinese
  myths transcribed in the fourth century BC. Judiciously chosen, their
  contemporary resonances range from the climate crisis to the boundless hubris
  of humankind. In the first, the death of the hairy titan Pan Gu creates sun
  and moon, mountains and rivers, and finally humans. The second tells of a
  drowned princess reborn as a vengeful bird. The third relates how 10
  over-enthusiastic suns are whittled down to one to prevent them burning up the
  planet, and the fourth how the dim-witted giant Kua Fu tries and fails to
  capture the sun that remains. The choir, robed like monks and with only their
  faces illuminated, tackle the intricate lines with confidence and a sure sense
  of pitch, singing in a combination of Mandarin and an unfathomable made-up
  language. The former appears now and again as surtitles, the latter does not.
  It is left to Twist and his puppeteers to tell us what is going on, which on
  the whole they do with craft and clarity. The imagery for tales one and two is
  a trifle plain: the story of the embittered bird and the ocean is told with
  little more than a crimson-fringed kite and a rippling white sheet. The
  propulsive fourth story, however, where the deconstructed fragments come
  together to create the sun-hunting giant, is visually arresting. But it’s the
  stately progression of the 10 lanterns in the third tale, where graceful
  movement echoes music of piercing beauty, that lingers longest. • At the
  Lyceum, Edinburgh, until 16 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
