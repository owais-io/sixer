  I think a long enough time has passed since the heyday of Sara Lee to concede
  the magnificence of the OG BFG: that towering torte of cherry brandy-soaked
  chocolate sponge, cherries and whipped cream whose name nods to the German
  Schwarzwälder’s many cherry trees and the black, white and red of its
  traditional dress. It’s also a very simple bake, because the show-stopping bit
  is all in the assembly. Prep 1 hr Cook 1 hr 5 min Serves 8-10 For the pastry
  layer (optional) 60g plain flour 5g cocoa powder 25g caster sugar 40g softened
  butter Salt For the sponge 6 large eggs 140g soft light brown sugar 60g cocoa
  powder Salt For the filling 750g fresh or frozen cherries, or 700g morello
  cherries in syrup (see step 1) 60g caster sugar (only if using fresh or frozen
  cherries) 1½ tbsp kirsch, or unsweetened cherry brandy (cherry liqueur will
  work, but is much sweeter) 500ml double or whipping cream ½ tsp vanilla
  extract 50g icing sugar 300g cherry jam 1 square dark chocolate, shaved into
  curls 1 A note on the cherries Traditionally, this cake is made with sour
  cherries, which aren’t readily available in the UK. You can sometimes find
  them frozen, or use morello cherries in syrup/juice, instead, but there are
  still summer cherries in the shops, so I’ve devised this recipe to use the
  fresh sweet variety (skip step 2 if you’re using jarred or tinned fruit). 2
  Prepare the cherries Stone all but 10 of your fresh or frozen cherries, if
  need be, and set aside the unstoned fruit for now. The only easy way to do
  this is with a cherry pitter; they’re not expensive and some can also be used
  for olives. Put the stoned cherries in a saucepan with the caster sugar, set
  it over a medium heat and cook, stirring gently, until the cherries soften but
  are still holding their shape. 3 Pasty or no pastry? Traditionally, the base
  of this cake is made from shortcrust pastry, rather than sponge, for the
  simple reason that it holds up better to being drenched in cherry juice and
  brandy than cake does. You can skip this and the next two steps for a simpler
  three-tier sponge cake that will require less cream and fewer cherries. 4 Make
  the pastry dough Line the base of a 20cm, loose-bottomed tin with a circle of
  greaseproof paper that’s cut neatly to fit. Sift the flour and cocoa powder
  for the pastry layer, if making, into a large bowl, add the sugar and a pinch
  of salt, and whisk to combine. Squidge in the butter to make a soft dough. 5
  Bake the pastry layer Use your fingers to press the dough into the base of the
  lined tin, so it covers it in a thin, fairly even layer. Cover and chill for
  20 minutes while you heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6, then bake
  for 15 minutes, until crisp. Take the tin out of the oven, carefully lift out
  the pastry and leave to cool. 6 Start the cake batter Line the same tin with
  more greaseproof paper and turn down the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4.
  Separate the eggs into two large bowls and whisk the yolks with the sugar
  until the latter dissolves and the mixture begins to thicken. Sieve in the
  cocoa powder and a pinch of salt, and stir gently to combine. 7 Finish the
  batter and bake Beat the egg whites until stiff, then stir a spoonful of them
  into the egg yolk mixture, just to loosen. Gently fold in the rest of the egg
  whites, then carefully spoon the mixture into the lined tin. Smooth out the
  top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until the cake is puffed up and set on top.
  Leave to cool completely in the tin (and be warned that it will sink
  slightly). 8 Flavour the cake Drain the cooked cherries and mix 50ml of their
  syrup with the kirsch. Use a bread knife to cut the cooled cake into three
  layers. Spoon some cherry syrup over the top of each one, being careful not to
  overload them. Whip the cream until it starts to thicken, then add the
  vanilla, sift in the icing sugar and whisk again until voluminous, but not
  stiff. 9 Finishing touches Spread a third of the jam on to the cooled pastry,
  then top that with a quarter of the cream and a third of the cooked cherries.
  Lay one of the three sponge cakes on top and repeat the jam, cream and cherry
  layers. Repeat again with a second sponge cake and more jam, cream and
  cherries. Top with the final sponge, spread with a voluptuous layer of cream
  and decorate with shaved chocolate and the reserved fresh cherries. • The
  subheading on this article was amended on 1 September 2025. An earlier version
  described the cake as being Bavarian. This reference has been removed.
