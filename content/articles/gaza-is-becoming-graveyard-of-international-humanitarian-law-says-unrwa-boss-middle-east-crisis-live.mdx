  Opposition leaders in Israel have condemned the torching of bins, cars and
  tyres in Jerusalem by anti-government protesters, reports the Times of Israel.
  Yair Lapid, opposition leader, posted on X: I condemn the torching of vehicles
  in Jerusalem, but I condemn much more a government that abandons hostages to
  their deaths in Gaza. According to the publication, protesters set several
  recycling bins alight, damaging cars, near prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s
  home in Jerusalem’s Rehavia neighbourhood and burned tires near the prime
  minister’s office in the Givat Ram neighbourhood. Israeli politician Benny
  Gantz responded by saying: The protests and solidarity with the families of
  the hostages today are a democratic right and a moral duty of every citizen –
  burning vehicles and any form of violence, by an unrepresentative minority,
  does not advance the return of the hostages and only harms the determined and
  important public struggle. Tens of thousands of reservists in Israel will
  return to active service in the coming weeks amid an intense debate in their
  ranks over the war in Gaza, which reflects wider divisions in the country.
  Some will be forced to make their decision within days. The Israel Defense
  Forces began mobilising tens of thousands of reservists on Tuesday after
  calling up 60,000 for an expanded offensive in Gaza City, one of the few
  places in the devastated territory outside its control. More will be ordered
  to report to military bases if the fighting continues for many months, as
  analysts expect. Many reservists interviewed by the Guardian last week said
  they would face “a hard choice” when asked to serve again, citing personal and
  ideological reasons. Few said they would refuse the call-up, however. “We are
  willing to give up our lives … but the obvious truth is that we are dying now
  for no reason,” said Aviad Yisraeli, a combat medic who was in Gaza last
  month. “Militarily, there is nothing more to gain … but then it also seems a
  bad choice to end this war with Hamas with some part of power in Gaza and
  [holding] some of the hostages and with the kibbutzim [in southern Israel]
  still vulnerable. So these are hard questions.” Many oppose the coalition
  government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and want the
  war to end now to bring back hostages still held by Hamas. “I never trusted
  [this government] … Every time I’ve gone back to serve since March 2024, I’ve
  gone with a heavy heart,” said a 47-year-old paratrooper who has served 450
  days since the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023 in which militants killed about
  1,200 people and abducted 250. “So if I go, it will be out of commitment to my
  battalion – because it’s like family, and I feel a huge responsibility toward
  them.” A poll in July found that three-quarters of Israelis favoured a deal to
  release the hostages and more than half said Netanyahu’s war leadership had
  been bad. More than 63,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed by the
  Israeli offensive in Gaza and most of the 2.3 million population have been
  displaced many times. Much of the Palestinian territory has been reduced to
  rubble. Israeli drones dropped four grenades close to UN peacekeepers in
  southern Lebanon near the border with Israel as they were working to clear
  roadblocks, the force said on Wednesday, adding that no one was hurt in the
  attack. The peacekeeping force known as Unifil described the Tuesday morning
  incident as “one of the most serious attacks on Unifil personnel and assets”
  since the cessation of hostilities in November that ended the 14-month
  Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military did not immediately comment,
  according to the Associated Press (AP). Unifil said Israeli drones dropped
  four grenades close to the peacekeepers, who were working to clear roadblocks
  that hindered access to a UN position along the border line. One grenade hit
  within 20 meters and three others within approximately 100 meters of UN
  personnel and vehicles, it said, adding the drones were observed returning
  toward Israel. According to the AP, Unifil said the Israeli military had been
  informed in advance of the peacekeeping force’s road clearance work in the
  area, southeast of the village of Marwahin less than a kilometer from the
  border line. Unifil said: Out of concern for the safety of peacekeepers
  following the incident, yesterday’s work was suspended. The attack came after
  the UN security council voted unanimously last week to terminate the UN
  peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon at the end of next year after nearly
  five decades, bowing to demands from the United States and Israel. The
  multinational peacekeeping force has played a significant role in monitoring
  the security situation in southern Lebanon for decades, including during the
  Israel-Hezbollah conflict. The force has also drawn criticism from both sides
  and from officials in US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has
  moved to slash US funding for the operation as Trump remakes the US’s approach
  to foreign policy. Unifil said any actions that endanger UN peacekeepers and
  assets or interfere with their tasks are unacceptable and a serious violation
  of international law and the resolution that ended the war. It added it is the
  Israeli military’s responsibility to ensure the safety and security of the
  peacekeepers performing security council-mandated tasks. Here are some of the
  latest images coming in via the newswires: Israel has launched a new spy
  satellite that defense officials described as a strategic cornerstone, saying
  it will strengthen their surveillance capacity across the Middle East in the
  years ahead, reports the Associated Press (AP). Military officials and defence
  minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that the satellite, launched late on
  Tuesday, will enhance Israel’s ability to collect images like the 12,000
  gathered over Iran during a 12-day war earlier this year. “This is also a
  message to all our enemies, wherever they may be – we are keeping an eye on
  you at all times and in all situations,” Katz said in a post on X. The AP
  reports that in addition to monitoring Iran, Israel gains reconnaissance
  capabilities in other parts of the Middle East as it conducts what prime
  minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called a “seven-front war,” with Israeli
  forces striking targets in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq throughout the 23
  months of war in Gaza. Maj Gen Amir Baram said the satellite, called Ofek 19,
  was part of a broader effort “to maintain persistent, simultaneous
  surveillance of any point throughout the Middle East”. Israel’s decades-old
  space programme has expanded its fleet with several satellite launches in
  recent years and is one of the few nations globally with high resolution
  monitoring and intelligence gathering capabilities. The aerospace and defence
  industry is a pillar of Israel’s economy and the satellite’s manufacturer,
  Israel Aerospace Industries, builds and sells satellites, missile systems,
  drones and aircraft to Israel as well as countries in Europe, Asia and North
  America. Israel’s military did not say from where the satellite was launched
  on Tuesday evening, according to the AP. The Israeli military said on
  Wednesday it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen, as sirens were
  activated in Tel Aviv and several other areas across the country, reports
  Reuters. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis have been launching missiles and drones
  thousands of kilometres up north towards Israel, in what the group says are
  acts of solidarity with the Palestinians. Israel has retaliated by bombing
  Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port. Its
  latest blow killed senior Houthi officials, including the head of the
  government. The Houthis, who control the most populous parts of Yemen, have
  also been attacking vessels in the Red Sea since the start of the war in Gaza
  in October 2023. Europe and the west’s double standards over the wars in
  Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine its global standing, the Spanish prime
  minister, Pedro Sánchez, has warned, describing the response to Israel’s
  assault on the Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of
  international relations in the 21st century. In an interview with the Guardian
  before talks with UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Wednesday, the
  socialist leader also said the US under Donald Trump was trying to end the
  post-second world war, rules-based global order it had originally created. He
  also defended the benefits of migration and blamed traditional rightwing
  parties for breaking the consensus over the response to the climate emergency
  by copying the policies of their populist rivals. Sánchez – the first senior
  European leader to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza – said he was pleased
  that other European nations were following Spain’s lead in recognising a
  Palestinian state, but accepted Europe’s response had been poor. He said: It
  is a failure. Absolutely. It is also the reality that, within the European
  Union, there are countries that are divided when it comes to how to influence
  Israel. But in my opinion, it’s not acceptable and we can’t last longer if we
  want to increase our credibility when it comes to other crises, such as the
  one we face in Ukraine. The roots of these wars are completely different but,
  at the end of the day, the world is looking at the EU and also at western
  society and asking: ‘Why are you doing double standards when it comes to
  Ukraine and when it comes to Gaza?’ Speaking as he attempts to reassert
  himself on the international stage and move past a series of damaging
  corruption allegations that have battered his administration and fuelled calls
  for a snap general election, Sánchez said he was pushing Europe to do more,
  including punishing Israel financially. He said: What we’re now witnessing in
  Gaza is perhaps one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the
  21st century, and in this regard what I have to say is that Spain has been
  very vocal within the EU and also within the international community. Within
  the EU, what we have done so far is advocate to suspend the strategic
  partnership that the EU has with Israel. The commissioner general of the
  United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) has
  warned that Gaza is “becoming the graveyard of international humanitarian
  law”. In an interview with El País, Philippe Lazzarini, said Unrwa had been
  “warning about the signs of famine and sounding the alarm bells for months”
  but that its warnings had “fallen on deaf ears”. He added that through its
  health centres, Unrwa had seen the number of acutely malnourished children in
  Gaza City had increased “sixfold in the last [six] months”. He also described
  the West Bank as seeing “unprecedented levels of violence and forced
  displacement, which would surely be making today’s headlines if they hadn’t
  been overshadowed by the disaster in Gaza”. Asked about international
  humanitarian law and for multilateral cooperation in future conflicts,
  Lazzarini said: Gaza is becoming the graveyard of international humanitarian
  law. Everything has been so blatantly disregarded … Including the provision
  ruling of the international court of justice urging a significant increase in
  unimpeded assistance. That was in January 2024, and look where we are today.
  Impunity prevails, and there’s a growing sense in the region that
  international humanitarian law is not universal. Today, it’s difficult to
  teach Palestinians anything about human rights in schools. We have made the
  Geneva convention[s] almost irrelevant. What is happening and being accepted
  today in Gaza is not something that can be isolated; it will become the new
  norm for all future conflicts. In an interview with the Guardian, the Spanish
  prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, described Europe’s response to the war in Gaza
  as a “failure”. He described the response to Israel’s assault on the
  Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of international
  relations in the 21st century. Here are some other key developments: Spanish

  has said his country will recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general
  assembly later this month, adding to international pressure on Israel after
  similar moves by Australia, Britain, Canada and France. The decision comes “in
  light of the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Palestine, particularly in
  Gaza, and in response to the violence perpetrated by Israel in violation of
  international law,” Prévot said in a post to social media. Israeli president
  Isaac Herzog will travel to the Vatican on Thursday to meet Pope Leo XIV, who
  recently demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment” of the
  population in Gaza. The one-day visit is being made at the invitation of the
  pope, Herzog’s office said in a statement on Tuesday.
