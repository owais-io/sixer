  The one change that worked: I gave up my allotment – and accepted who I really
  am

  For years I had coveted having an allotment. I pictured myself being practical
  and resourceful, growing vegetables and cycling home with them in my wicker
  basket. I imagined pickling produce like my grandmother had done and becoming
  outdoorsy and calm – not the hot mess I usually felt. An allotment, I
  believed, would make me a better person with a better life. In London it felt
  impossible, but when I moved back to Shrewsbury during the pandemic, I finally
  got one. Newly diagnosed with ADHD, I became hyperfocused on my new hobby. But
  beneath the enthusiasm, I was struggling to keep on top of everything that
  needed to be done. I found it hard to motivate myself to do the mundane tasks,
  such as digging up weeds, and was frustrated by all the pests that ruined my
  efforts. Harvesting overwhelmed me: everything was ready at once and often
  went to waste. The following year, I got pregnant and experienced bad morning
  sickness. The plot became even wilder than the year before: bindweed took
  over. Even though I was struggling, pregnancy only made the dream feel more
  important. I envisaged being an earth mother who wore her baby in a sling
  while picking vegetables for dinner. Instead, the plot quickly turned into a
  source of stress. It got worse when the baby arrived and I was too tired to do
  much. Bringing her was sometimes lovely, but often she screamed to be held –
  and you can’t get much done holding a baby, sling or not. I felt frustrated. I
  saw other young families do it, so why couldn’t I cope? I trudged on, but a
  year into motherhood, I finally gave up my plot. After a warning from the
  allotment society telling me I needed to tidy it up or I’d lose it, I vowed to
  make a final push but soon admitted defeat and decided to bow out. At first, I
  was heartbroken, but I realised I wasn’t upset about the plot – but about the
  fact that I wasn’t who I thought I was. Having an allotment was tied up with
  my identity. I’d wanted so badly to be a different kind of person – one of
  those serene wellness types I saw on Instagram, effortlessly cooking their
  homegrown veg in immaculate kitchens. Losing the allotment meant letting go of
  that fantasy but it also meant I was released from the constant shame that
  came with not living up to it. In reality, I’m someone who can’t even keep
  houseplants alive and that’s OK. Allotments are an important part of a
  community, but we can’t all be Monty Don. It felt so freeing to give up the
  idea that I had to be someone else to be a good mum and to finally be OK with
  who I really am. Since then I’ve been so much gentler with myself. I also have
  more time, more headspace and I no longer feel guilty for not using my spare
  time to be “productive”. I allow myself to sit on the sofa and enjoy a cuppa,
  and I’ve started reading fiction again. I’ve also spent more time in my
  much-neglected back garden, chasing my daughter around. In a culture obsessed
  with overachieving and self-improvement, and which celebrates seemingly
  perfect mothers, I found self-acceptance in my messy life, my imperfect
  approach to parenthood – and the fact my fingers most certainly aren’t green.
