  The Royal Society was right to keep Elon Musk as a fellow, the UK’s new
  astronomer royal has said, adding there was a benefit to the private sector
  playing a role in space exploration. Speaking to the Guardian after becoming
  the first woman to hold the 350-year-old position, the planetary scientist
  Prof Michele Dougherty said she had not been involved in the meetings around
  Musk’s fellowship, but that she supported the academy’s stance. “The outcome
  of those meetings, and I’ve seen emails about it, is that he remains as a
  fellow of the Royal Society, because the reason he was given the [fellowship]
  has not changed,” said Dougherty. Asked if she thought this was the correct
  outcome, she said: “Yes, I do.” Musk was elected a fellow of the Royal Society
  in 2018 for his contribution to the space and electric vehicle industries. But
  over the past year, a host of scientists have called for the Royal Society to
  take action, saying Musk had violated the academy’s code of conduct, including
  through his former role in leading the US department of government efficiency
  (Doge). In July the Guardian revealed the Royal Society had corresponded with
  Musk, suggesting he should consider resigning his fellowship if he felt unable
  to help with concerns raised by scientists about the Trump administration’s
  attacks on research. Musk did not respond to the suggestion and the Royal
  Society decided to take no further action. Musk remains active in the space
  industry: through his company SpaceX, he hopes to colonise Mars, and its
  spacecraft are already used to take people and cargo to the International
  Space Station. His fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos is also developing rockets
  through his Blue Origin company. Dougherty, 62, was upbeat about the role of
  the private sector in space exploration. “I think there is some real positive
  aspects to it, because it allows us to advance the instrumentation and the
  launches that would be done at a much slower pace if it was only government
  funding that was doing it,” she said, adding that the UK space sector, and the
  involvement of new companies, also benefited the economy. “What I would like
  to see is a bit more joined up thinking about what the focus should be and
  where we want to advance things,” she said. “But you know the launcher that
  Elon Musk is responsible for, where they grab the rocket fuel engine thingies
  and reuse them? The hair on my arms stood up on end when I saw that. It’s
  spectacular.” Dougherty said that while Mars was clearly also on the horizon
  for Nasa and the European Space Agency (Esa), she had never been tempted to
  head into space herself. “I’ve never wanted to be an astronaut. I’m not brave
  enough,” she said. “I think if something went wrong, I wouldn’t know what to
  do. For me, the way I like to do my exploration is you send out instruments
  that are able to take the measurements for you.” Dougherty was involved with
  the Cassini space mission that revealed unprecedented insights into Saturn and
  its system. The measurements taken by her magnetometer contributed to the
  discovery of plumes of water vapour and ice erupting from the surface of the
  moon Enceladus, raising the possibility it could be habitable. Dougherty is
  also principal investigator of the magnetometer for the Esa’s Juice mission,
  which is currently on its way to study Jupiter and three of its moons
  including Europa – a body thought to have an ice-covered ocean of salty water,
  making it another contender for harbouring life. Dougherty, who grew up in
  South Africa, said a key realisation about where to look for extraterrestrial
  life came after bacteria were discovered living in the depths of the Earth’s
  oceans, where the environment is extreme. “That’s the kind of life form that I
  would be very surprised if we are not able to find elsewhere in our solar
  system,” she said. “I’m not going to talk about little green men.” In her new
  role as astronomer royal, Dougherty said she hoped to share with the public,
  and particularly children, what scientists do and the excitement of
  discoveries. “I see humankind as explorers,” she said. “I think when we stop
  exploring, we would have lost a little bit of ourselves.”
