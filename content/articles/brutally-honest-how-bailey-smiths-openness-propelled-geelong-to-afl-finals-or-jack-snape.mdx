  Made-for-TV sports award presentations typically offer as much surprise as the
  sun at sunrise, so when Bailey Smith revealed at the All-Australian
  announcement last week he spent four weeks in a psychiatric ward last year,
  the shock reverberated around the AFL. Every aspect of Smith’s life, from his
  social media presence, to his relationships, the escapades out at night, and
  sometimes even his football, is the subject of one of Australia’s most
  insatiable creatures: Melbourne’s footy media. So when Smith volunteered what
  appeared to be a tightly-held personal secret, those present – including
  All-Australian teammate Noah Anderson seated alongside him – were driven to
  applause. But to others watching, it was old news. Over coffee at Max Holmes’
  parents’ place in eastern Melbourne a year ago, Smith had already told his
  then-future Cats midfield colleague everything. “He was really open about all
  the things he’s been through in his life,” Holmes said as the Cats prepare for
  their qualifying final against Brisbane at the MCG on Friday. “He’s in the
  spotlight a lot, so that stuff’s hard, and it was really brave of him the
  other day to talk about that stuff.” Ahead of finals sign up for our free
  weekly AFL newsletter Smith’s celebrity status and a history of indiscretions,
  including an admission of possession of a white powder, had some doubting
  whether he could fit in at the relaxed but performance-focused environment at
  Geelong. To those in the club including Holmes and vice-captain Tom Stewart,
  Smith laid it all on the table even before last year’s trade from the Bulldogs
  was finalised. “That was part of him thinking that we were concerned with some
  of the off-field antics, which wasn’t the case anyway, but he was really keen
  to speak to us about what he’s been through and how he’s working towards it
  going forward,” Holmes said. Stewart welcomed Smith to his house in Geelong
  exactly 12 months ago this week. “We had a coffee and he was as brutally
  honest there and then with me as he was in front of the entire audience last
  Thursday night,” he said. To Stewart, Smith opening up at the All-Australian
  awards was significant, as it showed how far the midfielder – now respected as
  one of the best players in the AFL – has progressed. “I don’t think this is a
  reflection of where he’s at now. I think the open honesty that he showed was
  in the past and he’s put a lot of work into that space,” he said. “He came
  down here with this insatiable appetite to work.” That appears to be paying
  off. Alongside Anderson, Smith shared the AFL Coaches Association award for
  player of the year, and has this season eclipsed his previous best averages in
  key metrics including disposals (31.7), tackles (5) and clearances (5.9).
  Holmes is another Cat having a career year, and the 22-year-old – who was two
  years below Smith at the East Malvern Knights as a child – partly credits the
  arrival of his midfield colleague for his own form. “At the start of the year,
  especially considering I had [last year] a bit of a breakout year, I put a lot
  of expectation on myself this year and I think that was really eased by the
  fact that Bailey went well and I felt like it was less necessary for me to
  play out of my boots,” he said. Geelong haven’t beaten a top-eight side since
  their win over Gold Coast in round 13, and Smith said last week described
  their run in to the finals as “easy”, or at least recognised others had spoken
  of it that way. But Stewart said the Cats’ victory over the Swans in the
  penultimate round tested their credentials. “Sydney was the form of the
  competition when we played them, I think they’d won five of their last six
  when we came up against them in Sydney, so in terms of a litmus test, that’s
  probably as tough as it gets.” Smith topped the disposal count with 30 that
  day, five more than anyone else. The performance came in the midst of
  increasing tabloid speculation around his romance with millionaire fitness
  influencer Tammy Hembrow, she of 17 million Instagram followers. The
  relationship was confirmed this week by a post on social media. Stewart
  describes himself as a private person, and “polar opposites” with Smith.
  Holmes said his fellow East Malvern product now occupies a different world.
  But both are glad the man with the white headband is on their side. “He’s
  living that celebrity life a little bit, but he’s able to manage that and his
  footy very well.” Holmes said. “What he’s doing off the field … if it’s not
  affecting him on the field, it’s happy days.”
