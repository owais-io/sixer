  For George Michael, it was guilty feet that left him unable to dance. For Eddy
  Grant, a world full of problems left him rooted to the spot as the music
  played. But for police officers amid the sound systems at this weekend’s
  Notting Hill carnival, it is orders from on high that dictate that no matter
  how the beat moves them, they are banned from dancing with revellers. Down the
  decades the scenes of officers strutting their stuff was seen as a cheesy but
  welcome attempt at repairing strained community relations. But in a statement
  on Monday, the Metropolitan police made it clear they feel a twerk or rhythmic
  shake of the hips may distract or slow down the 7,000 officers deployed to the
  carnival from responding to outbreaks of crime. The carnival is the biggest
  annual challenge for the Met. For the overwhelming majority of the more than 1
  million people attending, it is the biggest celebration of Caribbean culture
  in Europe and one of the biggest entertainment gatherings in the world. But
  the carnival’s two-day takeover of the streets of west London is dogged by
  serious crimes. Last year there were two murders and more than 60 officers
  were injured, as well as constant fears among police commanders of a
  catastrophic crush with so many people packed in narrow streets. One police
  source justified the dancing ban, which was first implemented in 2019, and
  said: “Carnival is a fantastic event but it is a serious event.” Privately Met
  chiefs feel that pictures of officers dancing, emerging when there has been
  serious violence, just does not sit right. In a statement the Met confirmed
  the dancing ban, and a spokesperson said: “Carnival is an iconic and
  spectacular event which attracts hundreds of thousands of people every year to
  party and celebrate Caribbean culture. “But it is also an event where there
  have been numerous concerns about crowd safety and crime. As a consequence,
  almost 7,000 officers will be deployed to this year’s event. They are there to
  keep revellers safe, not to join in the revelling. “We want officers to
  positively engage with the carnivalgoers while staying vigilant at all times
  and remaining able to respond and intervene swiftly as necessary. They can’t
  do this if they are dancing. “The standards of behaviour expected as part of
  the policing operation will be communicated clearly before the event, just as
  they have been in recent years.” Notting Hill carnival dates back almost seven
  decades, starting as a celebration of resistance in an openly racist Britain.
  This year police will controversially deploy live facial recognition systems
  in the approaches to the carnival, hoping to catch wanted suspects and deter
  people from attending who want to cause trouble. The carnival starts on Sunday
  with a day for children and families, and its busiest day is usually bank
  holiday Monday. It is by far the Met’s biggest policing operation of the year,
  taking place in Notting Hill, west London, with hundreds of thousands of
  people packed into narrow urban streets.
