  Donald Trump has faced an onslaught of criticism from opponents and Maga
  diehards alike, on issues such as Jeffrey Epstein, the war with Iran, and his
  steadfast alliance with Israel in the face of genocide. But among the ever
  dangerous far right, which has generally applauded Trump’s efforts to deport
  thousands of people a day, his actions of late have stirred rage among a group
  experts say has benefited greatly from his administration’s law-enforcement
  pivots. The FBI, headed by Trump acolyte Kash Patel, has reassigned the jobs
  of thousands of agents and eviscerated parts of the bureau tasked with
  investigating rightwing extremists that are considered the most dangerous
  domestic security threat facing the US today. Those same types, which includes
  a locus of fascist street-fighting gangs known as active clubs and
  accelerationist neo-Nazis, increasingly view Trump as an enemy, but are freer
  than ever to organize – almost entirely due to changes instituted in his
  latest presidency. “His alliance with Israel and Netanyahu is obviously
  problematic for antisemites, and there have always been questions about how
  dedicated Trump is to the cause of a white America,” said Heidi Beirich,
  co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, referring to
  American rightwing extremists’ view of the president. “Frankly, white
  supremacists have never had it so good as they do now under Trump.” Bierich
  did concede the far right was “never outwardly fond of him”, they have
  celebrated Trump’s enthusiastic deployment of Ice raids. On a neo-Nazi
  Telegram channel that has become a bellwether and influencer for active clubs
  around the world, Trump’s latest quip declaring he would not provide disaster
  relief in case of a natural disaster to states that do not support Israel
  struck a major nerve. “Israel first, America last,” it said in a post viewed
  several thousands of times by followers, with a headline associated with the
  story. In another adjacent account, neo-Nazis went further: “The fact that
  they even tried to put that in is disgusting.” In recent years, neo-fascist
  groups such as Patriot Front – heavily allied to the active club movement –
  have used natural disaster cleanups as a way to recruit and launder their
  image as white saviors to “European” Americans. “What we know is these groups
  are emboldened and the federal government appears to be abandoning its efforts
  to monitor and surveil racists and white supremacists,” Beirich said. “They
  can certainly act with less concern about FBI interference, and we should
  expect there will be more violence and more activity on the streets from these
  groups given what the federal government has shut down.” One of the
  president’s first moves, mere hours after his second inauguration in January,
  was to give full pardons to 1,500 people involved in the January 6 attack on
  Capitol Hill. Even research grants for academic and government researchers
  looking at the de-radicalization of extremists of every political persuasion
  have felt the force of Trump’s budgetary cuts. Yet with this backdrop of
  helpful policies, far-right activists have found reasons to part with Trump’s
  agenda. A near full-scale war with Iran earlier in the summer also set off a
  flurry of posts among some of the most hardcore and popular neo-Nazis who saw
  the latest geopolitical venture as a new, costly Iraq war. “Both sides spent
  years hyperventilating over the undisputed lethality of Iran,” wrote one
  influential neo-Nazi propagandist channel on Telegram. “I’m just happy it
  doesn’t look like whites will be dying for Israel.” But it was a recent
  American Eagle ad featuring the actor Sydney Sweeney – one alluding to her
  jeans as a reference to physical, genetic genes – that has enraged the online
  hordes of the far right. One called it Maga’s blatant attempt to win back
  their support through “white coded media” in service of a broader agenda.
  “Some Telegram propagandists have claimed that the Trump administration is
  explicitly attempting to appeal to white Americans to manipulate them
  further,” said Joshua Fisher-Birch, an analyst and expert on online
  extremists, “whether economically, politically, or while planning a new war.”
  According to Fisher-Birch, an influential channel with more than 2,000
  subscribers within the far-right Telegram ecosystem, carried out a poll in
  mid-July about Trump and the Epstein files, which showed that 70% of its
  respondents said they did not support the president. “The irony is that they
  should be celebrating Trump regardless,” said Beirich, “for the Ice raids, for
  appointing extremists like Darren Beattie and Stephen Miller, for putting
  Confederate statutes back up and assaulting DEI, not to mention the pardons.”
  Beattie, a senior state department official, has been linked to white
  nationalism, while Miller has been widely seen as the architect for the Trump
  administration’s hardline immigration policy and has long been lambasted for
  his racism “and white supremacist ideology”. Beirich cited how Patriot Front
  and Blood Tribe, another public facing neo-Nazi group, are marching on
  American streets with regularity, while people like former Proud Boys leader
  Enrique Tarrio – formerly imprisoned for his role in the January 6 attacks –
  have become regular speaking fixtures in official Republican circles.
  Fisher-Birch agreed that the far right was feeling the moment. “Many extreme
  right groups and propagandists certainly think that they have more latitude
  now than compared to a year ago,” he said. “However, it is also important to
  note that some groups are worried about being targeted for their
  antisemitism.” Even so, there are others in the extremist world who still view
  Trump and the broader US government with skepticism, undeterred by recent FBI
  changes or the president’s general tone towards them. For example, the Base,
  an internationally proscribed neo-Nazi terrorist group with roots in the US,
  still sees Trump as a problem. “We don’t expect leniency from the Trump
  administration,” it wrote on one of its accounts earlier this year, referring
  to a nationwide crackdown on the group in the past. “It was Trump’s
  [department of justice] which conducted an aggressive nationwide dragnet
  targeting members of the Base in 2020.” It added: “By comparison, political
  pressure against the Base was minimal when Biden was president.”
