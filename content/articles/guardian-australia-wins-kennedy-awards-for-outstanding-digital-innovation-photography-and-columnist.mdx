  Guardian Australia has won three Kennedy awards for outstanding digital
  innovation, outstanding portrait photography and outstanding columnist at an
  industry event in Sydney. The Leaving Gaza interactive, which showcased text
  messages exchanged between Palestinian friends – one in Gaza, one in the US –
  in the opening days of the Israel-Gaza war, won the innovation category. The
  interactive was produced by Guardian Australia’s Rafqa Touma, Ariel Bogle,
  Mostafa Rachwani, Nick Evershed, Andy Ball, Christelle Basil and Shelley
  Hepworth. Guardian Australia’s picture editor, Carly Earl, won a Kennedy award
  for her portrait of 19-year-old Riley Swanson while covering a droving team
  working south of Roma in central Queensland. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  Last month, the portrait won the 2025 Australian Life photography competition,
  with the judges praising Earl for capturing “a beautiful insight into reality
  of life in rural Australia” in her portrait of young drovers in central
  Queensland. Freelance photographer Elise Darwin was also a finalist in the
  same category for her portraits for Guardian Australia of residents of Lismore
  rebuilding their lives after damaging floods. Guardian Australia’s Ranjana
  Srivastava, an oncologist and Fulbright scholar, won the outstanding columnist
  category for her fortnightly pieces. Her entry was titled “On compassion and
  empathy in medicine”. Guardian Australia’s podcast on Gina Rinehart was also
  nominated for the outstanding podcast award. The podcast, presented by Sarah
  Martin and produced by Shelley Hepworth, Joe Koning and Miles Martignoni,
  charted the rise of Rinehart and her power and influence. Nine’s investigative
  reporter, Nick McKenzie, won journalist of the year for the third time for his
  series of reports about corruption in the construction industry, while Michael
  Bachelard and Charlotte Grieve of the Age won outstanding reporting on the
  environment for their reporting on carbon offsets. The Kennedy awards is named
  after Les Kennedy, a much-loved Daily Telegraph and Sydney Morning Herald
  crime reporter with impeccable police contacts, who died in August 2011 at the
  age of 53. His friends and colleagues set up the awards to honour his legacy.
