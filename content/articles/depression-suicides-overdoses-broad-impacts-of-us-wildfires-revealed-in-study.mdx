  New research looking at the aftermath of some of the deadliest wildfires to
  have struck the US in recent years has shed light on the devastating effects
  the disasters have on human health, with impacts that extend far beyond the
  official death toll and injury counts. Three studies published this week
  examine the long-term fallout from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires,
  including depression, suicide and overdose deaths, lung damage, and deaths
  caused by healthcare disruptions. The August 2023 Hawaii blazes killed more
  than 100 people, in what was the deadliest US wildfire in more than a century,
  and destroyed the town of Lahaina. The fires that tore through the LA
  communities of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades earlier this year killed 31
  people and destroyed more than 18,000 structures. Some of the new research
  found that the Maui fire left one in five people with lung damage, and as many
  as half with symptoms of depression. That study, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the
  University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after
  the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the
  fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas, with about 22% experiencing
  below-normal lung function. Additionally, about 40% of people reported their
  health had declined since the fires, according to the study, and close to half
  mentioned increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related
  symptoms. “It’s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but
  lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,” Juarez
  told the Associated Press in an email. During the month of the fire, 13
  suicides were reported in the area, nearly double the normal suicide and
  overdose death rates, another study found. The study of the Los Angeles fires,
  led by researchers in Finland, concluded that in addition to at least 30
  deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 deaths between January and
  February could be blamed on the event because of interruptions in healthcare
  and other factors. Dr Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental
  public health researcher who was not involved with the research, said the
  studies add “a really important piece to the understanding of the true health
  risks from these extreme climatic events”. As the climate crisis fuels
  worsening disasters across the US, from flooding to deadly wildfires,
  scientists are trying to gain a better understanding of the impacts of extreme
  weather events. Research into the effects of wildfire smoke has surged in
  recent years as massive blazes have caused orange skies and unhealthy air for
  millions of people from the west coast to New York. A 2021 study found that
  breathing wildfire smoke during pregnancy raises the risk of premature birth.
  Research published earlier this year found the climate crisis contributed to
  about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires
  and cost about $160bn between 2006 and 2020. Another study, published in 2024,
  determined that wildfire smoke prematurely killed more than 50,000 people in
  California over a decade. Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington noted
  that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic
  than standard air pollution. “It’s not just leaves and branches and trees”
  that are burned, she said. “It’s buildings. It’s gasoline stations. It’s old
  houses that have asbestos in them. It’s automobiles. There are lots of
  components of wildfire smoke.” She said the study of the Maui fire suggests
  “this toxicity is affecting people’s long-term lung function”, but noted more
  research is needed to look at cause and effect. Meanwhile, the research
  calculating rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii’s four
  other counties found a 97% increase in both on Maui during the month of the
  wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month,
  most of them suicides. That’s a significant increase, Ebi said. They also
  found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been
  influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors
  said. But rates fell in the following months. In addition to the studies
  published this week, a new report from the University of Hawaiʻi Economic
  Research Organization (UHERO), which is based on nearly a year of data from
  surveys of 950 people, documented the challenges that persist for those
  affected by the Maui fire. Two years later, some have found permanent housing
  and greater economic stability, but many people are still displaced and have
  faced long-term income loss and high rent burdens. While permanent housing is
  increasing, poverty rates in the region have almost doubled as full-time
  employment has not yet fully returned to pre-fire levels and nearly 60% of
  households report lower income. “Our findings show two realities unfolding
  side by side,” said Daniela Bond-Smith, a UHERO research economist. “Some
  households are finding new footing – moving into stable housing, returning to
  work and regaining stability. But others are still living with deep
  uncertainty, especially those with limited support and population groups who
  had already been marginalized prior to the fires.”
