  “I have just heard CMAT’s song Vincent Kompany because I am cool, young and
  relevant,” writes the cool, young and relevant Will Unwin. “I was wondering if
  any other player’s name is the title of a song, beyond simply being referred
  to?” In this age of streaming, there are many songs online whose titles are
  the names of footballers, but a few hundred listens here and there doesn’t
  make them particularly noteworthy. So we have wound back a bit to a time when
  songs were more commonly created in studios, not bedrooms. Resident music
  anorak John Brewin had a number of suggestions: “Joe Strummer, the late former
  Clash frontman, made a 1999 album with his Mescaleros band, and the lead-off
  track from Rock Art and the X-Ray Style was titled Tony Adams.” Strummer, a
  Chelsea fan, had this to say: “No one in this country rose up when he was
  denied the England armband, while he was winning his own fight against
  alcoholism. People might imagine footy is mundane, sometimes mundane stuff are
  important. We need people like Tony Adams.” Another suggestion is Stan Bowles,
  a 2005 single from the Others, a band whose interests and inspirations were
  shared with The Libertines. So much so, the song was actually a tribute to
  Pete Doherty, a famed QPR fan. “Like Stan, Peter’s very dedicated to QPR, and
  has an abundance of skill and talent, but just like Stan he had a passion for
  getting intoxicated – and in fact still does,” said the Others’ leader,
  Dominic Masters. The following lyric, “we′d talk for days in a room off
  Cambridge Heath Road, smoking bone in your backroom”, is presumed not to refer
  to the maverick former England forward and bookmakers’ friend. Two more
  suggestions from John: in 1999, Mogwai, the largely instrumental post-rock
  combo, did a song called Hugh Dallas, paying tribute to the famed Scottish
  referee with some rare, breathy singing. “Is the light so bad, were we so bad
  today?” Mogwai are Celtic fans, Dallas’s officiating having gained some
  notoriety among Hoops supporters. One more for luck? Eusébio by Louis Philippe
  with Dean Broderick. Louis Philippe happens to be the musical alter ego of the
  French football writer, Guardian contributor and Football Weekly regular
  Philippe Auclair. Florian Camphausen writes: “In 1983, the British
  husband-and-wife duo Alan &amp; Denise (that’s Alan Whittle and his wife
  Denise) bubbled into the German charts at No 43 with Rummenigge, a quirky
  synth-pop ode to Karl-Heinz Rummenigge’s ‘sexy knees’. Their follow-up,
  Beckenbauer, Beckenbauer (1986), sank into obscurity. Perhaps because it
  dulled things down, trading thigh-high tributes for mere ‘sex appeal’.” How
  about (Roberto) Baggio by the self-confessed plastic fan Miles Kane, the
  Wirral native who supported Manchester United in his youth but then changed
  his allegiance to Liverpool. “Adam Pastel, a singer from California, dropped
  Trinity Rodman earlier this year, titled after the USWNT and Washington Spirit
  forward,” croons Kyle Hill. “He actually performed the song at half-time of
  the Spirit’s season opener back in April, which gets used heavily in the music
  video. It, uh, wasn’t a great performance. From either Adam Pastel or the
  Spirit.” Mark Gibbings-Jones takes us to Japan. “Where better to start than
  the Shibuya-kei scene? Specifically the work of the genre-straddling solo
  artist Yukari Fresh, whose 1999 album New Year’s Fresh included songs named
  Paul Scholes and Michael Owen, the latter throwing in a sample of Barry
  Davies’ commentary for good measure. Her fascination with the England team of
  the era didn’t end there – 2003’s Scholesy’s Stamp is a winsome ballad about
  the midfield schemer, 1998’s David is about … you can probably guess, while
  2002’s Macca at the Old Wembley is about Steve McManaman rather than Paul
  McCartney.” And finally, the Australian funk band Vaudeville Smash
  collaborated with the commentator Les Murray in 2014 for their song Zinedine
  Zidane. It was never going to bother the Grammys, but the video’s worth a
  watch. We’re sure there are many more worthy additions. If you have one, you
  know where to send it. An away-day to remember “I’m savouring a veritable
  feast of Luxo-British football in the Conference League: Differdange v The New
  Saints, followed by Strassen v Dundee United,” writes Martin Davies. “Both
  games will take place at Differdange’s stadium. Have two British teams played
  European ties in the same stadium within 48 hours of each other before?”
  Raymond Simpson can offer not just another example with British teams, but one
  that also involves Dundee United – and a much shorter time window. “Both us
  and Rangers played a match in the same stadium on the same day back in 1983,”
  Raymond notes. Jim McLean’s Tangerines faced the Maltese outfit Hamrun at the
  Ta Qali Stadium in the European Cup first round on 14 September 1983, winning
  their first leg 3-0. Remarkably, their game kicked off at 4.45pm with Rangers’
  Cup Winners’ Cup tie against Valletta starting at 3pm, meaning they were
  effectively back-to-back. The double-header went ahead despite protests from
  Malta’s Uefa Cup representatives, Rabat Ajax, and concerns about potential
  trouble between the two sets of away fans. Dundee United won 6-0 on aggregate
  and went all the way to the semi-finals, while Rangers won 8-0 in Malta (and a
  sobering 18-0 on aggregate) but lost to Porto in the next round. Knowledge
  archive “Watching the new, exciting Chelsea beat Birmingham last weekend, I
  got to thinking about all the fuss we had two years ago when there were only
  19 goals on the first weekend of the Premiership/Premier League,” wrote Ken
  Whannel in August 2007. “What has been the best opening weekend in the history
  of the English top flight in terms of goals-per-game scored?” For the winner
  you have to go all the way back to the Football League’s third-ever season,
  1890-91, when only 10 of the league’s 12 teams played in the first round of
  matches, combining for an impressive 29 goals (5.8 per game). Of course, those
  figures were slightly skewed by Derby County’s 8-5 win over Blackburn, but
  every team scored at least once, with Accrington’s 1-1 draw with Burnley the
  lowest-scoring fixture. As fate would have it Derby were the only team not to
  score in the second-most exciting opening day, going down 1-0 at Preston three
  seasons later as the league’s 16 teams combined for 38 goals (4.75 per game).
  Since the Premiership/Premier League began the highest goals-per-game ratio on
  week one has been a rather less spectacular 3.6, achieved in 2003-04 when
  Blackburn’s 5-1 win over Wolves contributed one sixth of the weekend’s 36
  strikes. The highest tally of goals (rather than goals-per-game) for an
  English top-flight opening weekend, meanwhile, came in 1926-27, when 22 teams
  combined for 52 goals (4.73 per game). Can you help? “I’ve now seen Crystal
  Palace lift four different trophies at Wembley (Zenith Data Systems Cup,
  Championship playoff trophy, FA Cup, Community Shield),” writes Toby Kinder.
  “Manchester United and Liverpool never managed the ZDS, but have both won the
  European Cup there, as well as all the domestic trophies, so are probably on
  four too. Can any other club beat that?” “Just watching Southampton v Wrexham
  and in the 72nd minute four players with the first name Ryan came on or left
  the field on both teams,” begins Ryan from Dortmund. “Ryan Longman for Ryan
  Barnett, Ryan Hardie for Josh Windass (all Wrexham) and Saints’ Ryan Manning
  coming on for Welington. Are there other examples of the same names coming on
  around the same time?” “My uncle and I recently watched Will Still (32) and
  Fabian Hürzeler (32) do battle in pre-season,” notes Joe Strawson. “Both
  younger than me, and with a combined age younger than my uncle, are there
  examples of managers with a lower combined age facing each other?” “Curtis
  Jones completed 53 out of 53 passes in the Community Shield. Against
  Southampton in 2024 he enjoyed a 100% completion rate with 58 passes,” writes
  Gregg Bakowski. “What is the record number of passes completed by a player
  with a 100% record in a match? Surely someone has completed more.” “With
  Hearts now making noises about winning the Scottish Premiership, I notice it’s
  actually 65 years since this last happened (1960). With Hibs it’s even longer
  at 73 years (1952),” writes Paul White. “Is there any other country where a
  club from its capital city have failed to win its domestic league for so
  long?” “A mate mentioned the impressive statistic that Liverpool have not
  finished lower than eighth in the league since being promoted to the old First
  Division in 1962. Taking the 1962-63 season as the starting point, what is the
  lowest position that all current Premier League teams have finished between
  1963 and the present?” ask the lads at the Star and Dragon Pub, Carbondale,
  Illinois. “And what is the lowest any team has fallen that has played at least
  one season in the top division since 1962-63?” Mail us with your questions and
