  Time to wrap up… Global markets have been rattled by a weak US jobs report
  which suggests Donald Trump’s trade wars have hurt America’s labor market. The
  latest Non-Farm Payroll report showed that the US economy added 73,000 jobs in
  July, far lower than expected, as the unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1%
  in June. The Bureau of Labor also slashed the number of jobs added in recent
  months. May’s jobs figure was revised down by 125,000, from 144,000 to 19,000,
  and June was revised down by 133,000, from 147,000 to 14,000 – a combined
  258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. Here’s the full story: The weak
  jobs report rocked Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average is down
  496 points, or 1.1%, at 43,634 points. US bond yields also fell sharply, as
  traders raised their bets on cuts to US interest rates this year. Donald Trump
  repeated his demand for lower borrowing costs, claiming that Federal Reserve
  chair Jerome Powell was “a stubborn MORON” for not acting faster. Stocks have
  fallen in London, and across Europe. Investors were already anxious, after
  Trump announced new tariffs on dozens of US trading partners. Last night, as
  the latest deadline to reach deals approached, the US president signed an
  executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41%. Rates were set at
  25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s
  self-imposed deadline of 1 August for striking trade deals with countries
  worldwide. Trump also extended the deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico
  by another 90 days. Our US Politics liveblog has full reaction to the jobs
  report, and the trade war: There’s been a heavy sell-off across European
  markets too, amid trade war fears and jitters about the US economy. Germany’s
  DAX was down around 2.5% as trading ended, with the situation in Paris even
  worse – France’s CAC 40 has shed 2.85%. Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 2.55%. Tariff
  anxiety, and the weak US jobs report, have dragged London’s stock market down
  to its lowest closing level in over a week. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip
  shares has ended the day down 64 points, or -0.7%, at 9,068 points. That takes
  it away from record highs set yesterday, and is the lowest close since 23
  July. Banks were among those worst hit, pounded by expectations of interest
  rate cuts, along with some mining companies. This post from Harvard professor
  Jason Furman, who chaired Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, shows
  how US jobs creation has been weaker this year than in 2023 and 2024: As well
  as demanding interest rate cuts (again) today, Donald Trump also called Fed
  chair Jerome Powell “a stubborn MORON”, and urged top Federal Reserve
  officials to seize control if Powell fails to cut borrowing costs. Here’s the
  full story: Stephen Miran, who chairs Donald Trump’s Council of Economic
  Advisors, has conceded that July’s US jobs report “isn’t ideal”. But Miran
  also insists that better times are ahead. Speaking to CNN, Miran suggests that
  more than half the downward revisions to employment growth in May and June
  (which cut employment totals by 258,000) were due to “quirks of the seasonal
  adjustment process”. He also attributes some of the drop in employment to the
  fact the White House has “eliminated about a million jobs for foreign born
  workers”, according to a transcript provided by CNN. Miran adds: Finally,
  we’ve been hearing a lot about uncertainty over the last few months, but
  that’s all resolved now. We – we’re creating trade deals left and right that
  have unlocked enormous new potential for the American economy. The tariff
  uncertainty is fading away. Tariff rates are settling in. The one big,
  beautiful bill is now law. There’s no more uncertainty over the tax bill
  either, over the – over potentially the biggest tax hike in American history.
  And on top of that, there are such strong, powerful incentives in the one big,
  beautiful bill for investment. Things like full expensing on investment in
  equipment, in R&amp;D, on new factory structures. These are huge. So, it’s all
  going to get much, much better from here. A key measure of US job creation is
  its weakest since early in the Covid-19 pandemic, reports Bloomberg’s Lisa
  Abramowicz: More bad news: economic activity in the US manufacturing sector
  contracted in July for the fifth month in a row. The latest poll of purchasing
  managers at US factories, just released by the Institute of Supply Management
  (ISM), shows that new orders and backlogs contracted in July, suggesting a
  weakening in demand. Prices also rose – perhaps a sign of the impact of
  tariffs? – while both exports and imports contracted. This pulled the ISM’s
  manufacturing PMI down to 48% in July, from 49% in June. Susan Spence, chair
  of the ISM’s manufacturing business survey committee:, says: In July, US
  manufacturing activity contracted at a faster rate, with declines in the
  Supplier Deliveries and Employment Indexes contributing as the biggest factors
  in the 1-percentage point loss of the Manufacturing PMI. Some companies blamed
  the disruption and confusion caused by Donald Trump’s trade wars. One, in the
  “apparel, leather and allied products” sector, said: These tariff wars are
  beginning to wear us out. It’s been very difficult to forecast what we will
  pay in duties and calculate any cost savings we’ve had this year. Also,
  tariffs have disrupted our customs import bond. There is zero clarity about
  the future, and it’s been a difficult few months trying to figure out where
  everything is going to land and the impact on our business. So far, tremendous
  and unexpected costs have been incurred. A second, in the electrical
  equipment, appliances and components sector, reported: Tariffs are causing
  complete uncertainty around sourcing strategies. A sit-and-wait game for now.
  A third company, though, warned that higher interest rates were depressing the
  construction industry, while a fourth reported strong sales growth driven by
  datacenter construction. A cut to US interest rates in September looks
  “increasingly likely”, argues James Knightley, ING’s chief international
  economist. Knightley says: It is impossible to deny that the July jobs report
  is weak with non-farm payrolls rising 73k versus 104k consensus, but the most
  striking thing is the huge 258k downward revision to the past two months of
  data. June job gains, which were originally 147k, are now 14k and May’s
  initially reported gain of 144k is now 19k. This puts a completely different
  light on what has been happening in the US economy post the 2 April
  ‘Liberation Day’ announcements. Lesotho isn’t the only country to receive a
  reprieve from Donald Trump. As flagged earlier (see here), Lesotho was facing
  50% tariffs on 2 April, an existential threat to its textile industry, but
  came out on Friday with a 15% rate. That’s a relief for a state which Trump
  said “nobody has ever heard of” when he halted USAID earlier this year. Also
  getting a drastic reduction in tariffs are Madagascar, down from 47% on 2
  April to 15% on 1 August, and Botswana, down from 37% to 15% Liechtenstein,
  the wealthy European state best known as a financial centre, has seen rates
  slashed from 37% to 15%, while the Falkland Islands have gone from 41% to 10%.
  Cambodia went from 49% to 19%, while Iraq only got a four-point reduction,
  from 39% to 35% Ding ding goes the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange
  – the signal for an early burst of selling! The main US stock indices have
  fallen sharply at the start of trading, as investors react to the flurry of
  tariffs announced last night and today’s weak US jobs report. The Dow Jones
  industrial average (which contains 30 large US companies) has fallen by 1.1%
  at the start of trading, shedding 501 points to 43,629. The broader S&amp;P
  500 index is down 1.2%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 1.5% – with
  Amazon falling almost 7% after issuing disappointing forecasts last night.
  Today’s weak payroll report has punctured the narrative of a resilient US
  economy, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, explaining: Tariffs
  have yet to meaningfully kick in, so the fact that jobs growth has been anemic
  at this early stage is worrying. As we start a new month and end the week, a
  new narrative about the US economy is emerging. It is one where the labour
  market is rapidly softening, where wage growth remains strong, which could
  pressurize corporate margins down the line, and where the US economy needs
  interest rate cuts. For now, that narrative is bad news for global stocks.
  Most of the 73,000 jobs created across the US economy in July were in
  healthcare. Today’s non-farm payroll report shows that healthcare added 55,000
  jobs in July, above the average monthly gain of 42,000 over the prior 12
  months. That includes 34,000 in “ambulatory health care services” and 16,000
  at hospitals. Social assistance employment rose by 18,000. But on the other
  side of the ledger, federal government employment levels fell by 12,000 in
  July and are down by 84,000 since reaching a peak in January. That won’t give
  a full insight into Doge-related job cuts, though, as employees on paid leave
  or receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed. There was little
  change in employment levels in other major industries, including mining,
  quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; manufacturing; wholesale
  trade; retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; financial
  activities; professional and business services; leisure and hospitality; and
  other services, the Bureau for Labor Statistics adds. Today’s non-farm
  payrolls report does not paint a pretty picture, points out Nicholas Hyett,
  investment manager at investment service Wealth Club: July’s job creation is
  slower than expected, but the bigger news is the major revision to May and
  June’s job numbers which are down a combined 258,000. If Fed governors were
  looking for reasons to cut interest rates, this is one. The problem is that
  for all the extra clarity, these numbers still only show what’s happening in
  the rearview mirror. In hindsight, the journey so far has been bumpier and
  more precarious that it seemed at the time, but the road ahead is still
  clouded in fog. Just today, President Trump has reignited the global trade war
  with major knock-on effects for stock markets and the global economy.
  Investors and policymakers will be stuck slaloming through unexpected
  obstacles for some time yet. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal
  Asset Management, fears the US jobs market will keep weakening: Not only was
  this a much weaker than forecast payrolls number, the monster downward
  revisions to the past two months inflicts a major blow to the picture of labor
  market robustness. What’s more concerning is that with the negative impact of
  tariffs only just starting to be felt, the coming months are likely to see
  even clearer evidence of a labor market slowdown. Of course, with Powell
  emphasising his focus on the unemployment rate which has only ticked up to
  4.2%, perhaps it is too early to press the panic button. The shrinking of
  labor supply is somewhat offsetting the weakness in labor demand, keeping the
  labor market in an uneasy state of equilibrium. Even so, the sheer weakness of
  today’s payrolls number means that Powell will have to take notice. The odds
  of a September cut just took a big leap higher. Thomas Ryan, North America
  economist, agrees that today’s weak jobs report will embolden the dovish
  policymakers at the Federal Reserve who want to cut interest rates, saying:
  The weak 73,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in July, combined with large
  downward revisions to May and June’s gains and an uptick in the unemployment
  rate to 4.2%, will strengthen the case for those on the [federal open market
  committee of the Federal Reserve] pushing for imminent interest rate cuts.
  [Reminder, the Fed left rates on hold on Wednesday, in a split vote.] This
  chart shows just how bad the last three months have been for job creation in
  the US: Donald Trump has again repeated his plea for the US Federal Reserve to
  cut interest rates. Shortly after today’s weak jobs report was released, Trump
  posted on his Truth Social site: Too Little, Too Late. Jerome “Too Late”
  Powell is a disaster. DROP THE RATE! The good news is that Tariffs are
  bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA! [Factcheck: tariffs are paid by the
  company or individual importing goods into the US. They only way they can
  “bring in dollars” is if the exporting company lowers its prices, to keep its
  goods competitive, meaning the importer doesn’t suffer a relative loss once it
  has paid the tariff.] The US dollar is being hammered on the foreign exchange
  markets, as today’s weak jobs report alarms traders. The dollar index, which
  tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, is now down 0.9% today.
  The euro has surged by almost a cent and a half, to $1.154, while the pound is
  up three-quarters of a cent at $1.328. Here’s snap reaction from Heather Long,
  chief economist at credit union Navy Federal: Today’s surprisingly weak US
  jobs report is causing ructions in the market. The yields, or interest rates,
  on US government bonds are falling sharply – a sign that investors are piling
  into bonds because they expect cuts to US interest rates to support the
  economy, or are simply seeking a safe-haven asset. Reuters has the details:
  US. Treasury yields fell after data showed on Friday the world’s largest
  economy created fewer jobs than expected in July, increasing the odds that the
  Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates at the September meeting.
  U.S. two-year yields, which are tied to the Fed’s monetary policy, dropped
  14.2 bps to 3.811%. UK government bond yields – which track the cost of
  Britain’s government borrowing – have also dropped. Newsflash: Employment
  growth across America has been much weaker than previously thought over the
  last three months – a sign that the US labor market may be cooling. The latest
  non-farm payroll, just released, shows that US employment rose by just 73,000
  in July, rather weaker than the 110,000 new jobs expected. But the big shock
  comes in the latest revisions to payrolls, with previous estimates for both
  May and June being revised sharply lower. The Bureau of Labor Statistics now
  estimates that just 19,000 new jobs were created in May, 125,000 fewer than
  the 144,000 previously estimated. June’s data has been revised down too -
  showing that just 14,000 new jobs were created, not the 147,000 reported a
  month ago. That means 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than
  previously thought. The US unemployment rate has risen to 4.2% from 4.1% in
  June. This surprisingly weak data may be a sign that Donald Trump’s trade
  wars, and the associated uncertainty, have cause more damage to the US economy
  than previously thought. There could also be an impact from cost-cutting DOGE
  program pushed by Elon Musk. The BLS says: Employment continued to trend up in
  health care and in social assistance. Federal government continued to lose
  jobs. Donald Trump’s tariff playbook is becoming clearer following last
  night’s announcement, says Paul Diggle, chief economist at Aberdeen
  Investments. This playbook consists of: A 10% global baseline tariff A rate of
  at least 15% on countries with goods trade deficits with the US An additional
  40% on goods transhipped to evade higher rates elsewhere A variety of new
  country-specific rates on smaller trading partners, such as 20% on Taiwan or
  39% on Switzerland Trump has also announced a 35% tariff on Canada, although
  the carve-out for USMCA-compliant trade remains [that’s the United
  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] Diggle adds that there are still plenty of
  uncertainties, including where US-China tariffs settle…. Last night’s tariff
  announcement contained some good news for the African country of Lesotho.
  Donald Trump has lowered Lesotho’s tariff rate to 15%, having previously
  threatened it with a 50% rate. That should make it easier for manufacturers in
  Lesotho – which last month declared a national state of disaster over the
  country’s “high rates of youth unemployment and job losses” – to sell their
  goods to American consumers. The BBC reported earlier this week that a Lesotho
  garment factory, which has produced Trump-branded golf shirts, was at risk of
  shutting down due to the high tariffs…. A quick recap. Stock markets in Europe
  and across Asia-Pacific countries have fallen after Donald Trump announced new
  tariffs on dozens of US trading partners. Last night, as the latest deadline
  to reach deals approached, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs
  ranging from 10% to 41%. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and
  30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August for
  striking trade deals with countries worldwide. Trump also extended the
  deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Share prices
  have weakened in response – with Germany’s DAX down 1.9% and France’s CAC
  losing 2.2%, as European stock markets fell to a one-month low. Asia-Pacific
  stock markets were on track for their worst week since April, with Japan’s
  Nikkei 225 losing 0.6%, South Africa’s stock market is now down almost 1.5%.
  Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said he was disappointed that Donald
  Trump was raising its tariffs from 25% to 35%. And there was shock in
  Switzerland, which has been lumbered with a 39% tariff rate – which
  manufacturers fear will lead to job losses. The European stock market selloff
  is gathering pace. After a volatile morning, Germany’s DAX index and Italy’s
  FTSE MIB are both down 1.9% while France’s CAC has lost 2.3%. Joshua Mahony,
  chief market analyst at financial services group Rostro, reports that
  sentiment in the markets has ‘soured’ after last night’s tariff announcements
  from the White House. Global markets are heading lower as we close out a week
  of major volatility, with a raft of corporate, economic, central bank, and
  trade headlines hitting the newswires on a daily basis. For the most part we
  have seen the strength of US tech earnings and positive trade agreements
  helping to prop up market sentiment for many markets, although that strength
  has started to falter as risks grow. With the DAX falling to the lowest level
  in a month, we have clearly started to see sentiment sour after relative
  stability. The announcement of tariff levels across the globe has provided a
  follow up to the initial ‘Liberation Day’ cardboard cutout, with the new
  levels providing many with lower tariffs than had initially been set out.
  Notably, those rates come into play in a weeks’ time, providing hope for those
  seeking fresh trade agreements before the heftier tax levels come into play.
  Many companies will be confused about how the new US tariffs apply to them,
  warns Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the International Chamber of
  Commerce (ICC). Wilson explains: “At a macro level, last night’s announcement
  provides confirmation that the administration is set on applying generally
  higher tariff rates. So, the TACO logic seems to be off the menu. But at a
  more practical level, we still see companies struggling to understand how the
  country specific rates will apply in practice. The Executive Order (EO) only
  states the headline tariff rate, with no specifics as regards their
  implementation aside from the EU deal. As such, there are still widespread
  questions about which tariffs will stack — the Japan deal for instance is
  notably silent on this issue compared to the EU agreement. So, clarity on the
  direction of travel. But many questions remain about implementation and the
  real world implications.” As an example, the information released by the White
  House last night showed that Brazil now faced a tariff of 10%. However, on
  Wednesday Trump signed an executive order confirming that the US would impose
  50% tariffs on Brazil. And as my colleague Lisa O’Carroll explained in her
  earlier post, the European Union’s trade deal with the US (a 15% tariff,
  agreed last weekend) is not stacked on top of a pre-existing tariff, meaning
  it’s a better deal than many other countries. The US dollar has hit its
  highest level in two months against a basket of currencies today. The dollar
  index has risen by 0.1%, on track for its seventh daily rise in a row. Traders
  may be calculating that Trump’s tariffs will be inflationary, pushing prices
  paid by consumers and making it harder for the US Federal Reserve to lower
  interest rates. They could also be factoring in the damage that the trade war
  will do to other countries, which could force their central banks to keep
  interest rates lower. Donald Trump’s decision to hit Switzerland with a 39%
  tariff rate has caused shock in the markets, and in the Swiss Confederation.
  Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter posted on X last night that she spoke to
  Donald Trump on Thursday, but that the two country’s hadn’t reached an
  agreement. She explained: I had a final conversation today with US President
  Trump before the deadline for US tariffs expires. For the President, the trade
  deficit is the main focus. No agreement could be reached on the letter of
  intent negotiated between Switzerland and the USA. The Swiss government says
  (see earlier post) it “continues to strive for a negotiated solution” over a
  tariff announcement which it “notes with regret”; manufacturers are warning
  that jobs are at risk. Stefan Brupbacher, director of manufacturers’
  association Swissmem, said: “I am stunned. These tariffs are based on no
  rational basis and are arbitrary. “This decision puts tens of thousands of
  jobs in the industry at risk.” Swissmechanic, an industry lobby group, called
  the 39% rate “dangerous.” It urged the government to keep negotiating in the
  remaining time until the tariffs are set to come into effect on 7 August,
  which otherwise risks leaving the economy becoming “one of the few countries
  that permanently struggle with structural competitive disadvantages”,
  Bloomberg reports. As flagged earlier, shares in Watches of Switzerland have
  fallen sharply in London – they’re now down almost 9%. Kathleen Brooks,
  research director at XTB, says Switzerland got the rough end of Trump’s trade
  war, explaining: The Swiss rate was a shock, and the Swiss government have
  said that they plan to keep negotiating with the US to secure a lower levy.
  Chocolatiers, watch makers and pharma companies are all under threat. Pharma
  accounts for 50% of Swiss exports to the US. Swiss pharma giant Novartis’s
  share price is lower by 2% today, while Roche is lower more than 3% on Friday.
  Swiss pharma giants are also pressured by Trump’s campaign to force drug
  makers to charge lower prices for US consumers and demanding that they charge
  the same rate for the US as they do for other countries. Switzerland will hope
  to secure the same rate as the EU, but time is running out. It appears that
  Switzerland may have been punished more than elsewhere because of the Swiss
  government’s desire to protect its openness, and to protect its domestic
  agriculture. Although it had said it was willing to lower import rates for
  fruit, nuts, shellfish and some medical devices, this was not enough for the
  US. Today’s selloff has dragged European stock markets down to a one-month
  low. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is now down 1.1% at its lowest level
  since late June. European pharmaceuticals stocks have dropped after Donald
  Trump wrote to executives at 17 companies on Thursday, demanding they match
  their US prices for prescription drugs with the lowest price offered in other
  developed nations. Taiwan’s government is hoping that it can negotiate its new
  US tariff down, before the new deadline of 7 August. Taiwanese president Lai
  Ching-te said today that the new 20% tariff rate set by the Trump
  administration on goods imported from the island is “temporary”, and the
  government expects to negotiate a lower figure. Lai also noted that rates for
  semiconductors, electronics as well as information and communication
  technology will be subject to separate U.S. sectoral tariffs and are still to
  be worked out. Lai told a press briefing: “The 20% tariff rate was never
  Taiwan’s target to begin with. We will continue negotiations and strive for a
  rate that’s more favourable for Taiwan.” France’s wine and spirits industry
  expects to lose €1bn should the US go ahead with imposing a 15% import tariff
  on their products next week, as the European Union makes a last-ditch effort
  to obtain an exemption, Bloomberg reports. The levy, due to come into force on
  7 August, will likely cut a quarter of France’s annual exports from the
  sector, the country’s federation of wine and spirit exporters FEVS said in a
  statement on Friday. It will also jeopardize the jobs of the 600,000 people
  directly employed by the industry, they fear. FEVS President Gabriel Picard
  said: “We welcome the efforts already made to try to obtain the exclusion of
  wines and spirits from this 15% duty. “The situation cannot remain as it is.
  It is vital that France and the European Union actively engage with us to very
  concretely support our sector.” Trump’s tariffs are a huge blow to global
  commerce, warns Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank. Bakiskan’s
  verdict is that that the situation is bad, but could have been even worse,
  explaining: The tariffs distort competition between companies that produce in
  the US to serve the US market relative to those that produce abroad. But many
  European, Japanese and South Korean-based producers compete more against each
  other than against US-based producers in the US market. As they all face a 15%
  levy, the competition between them is distorted by less than would have been
  the case if Trump had imposed widely different country-specific US tariffs
  against these key advanced economies. The US trade war has been hampering UK
  and eurozone manufacturers, new data shows. The latest poll of purchasing
  managers at British factories, just released, highlights that new orders at UK
  manufacturers fell in July. Data provider S&amp;P Global says: New export
  orders have now decreased throughout the past three-and-a-half years, with the
  latest decline reflecting global tariff uncertainties, ongoing administrative
  issues postBrexit and rising competition. There were reports of lower demand
  from North America, mainland Europe, the Middle East, India and mainland
  China. A survey of eurozone factories, also released this morning, found that
  their supply chains remained strained in July, with delivery times
  lengthening. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial
  Bank, explains: “Given the fragility of the recovery, it is not demand that is
  causing customers to wait longer for their goods. Volatile U.S. tariff
  policies and uncertainty stemming from geopolitical tensions may play a key
  role here. We expect that companies will continue to face sudden supply chain
  disruptions for the foreseeable future.” President Trump’s latest flurry of
  tariffs implies that the US effective tariff rate will rise to about 18%, from
  2.3% last year, reports Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at
  City consultancy Capital Economics. Brown told clients this morning: That is a
  little higher than we assumed and so presents modest downside risks to our
  forecast for global GDP growth and a small upside risk to our US inflation
  forecast. That said, this is unlikely to be the final word, as it still seems
  likely that some other countries will reach their own deals with the US, while
  there is a chance that the US courts will eventually strike down these
  tariffs. The headline 15% tariff rate applying to most EU goods is better than
  most countries as it is not in addition, or stacked on top of, a pre-existing
  tariff, say experts. That was the snap analysis of Donald Trump’s tariff list
  by David Henig, director at the European Centre for International Political
  Economy. He posted on social media: “New US tariffs dropped. Don’t be
  Switzerland. Do be the EU that uniquely got a concession on tariff stacking,
  which should but won’t silence the doomsters with no actual trade policy or
  geopolitical knowledge.” The EU says its pre-Trump average tariff was 4.8%,
  arguing therefore, that the 15%, is closer to others who have secured a 10%
  baseline tariff. The UK’s 10% tariff is stacked on top of the average most
  favoured nation tariff rate of 3.7% that applied before Trump was elected,
  bringing the post-Trump average to 13.7% tariff. By contrast the EU’s 15% is
  inclusive of the pre-Trump MFN of 4.8%. The US stock market is set to fall
  when trading begins in New York in five and a half hours. The futures market
  indictates that the S&amp;P 500 – the broad index of US stocks – is on track
  to fall around 0.85%. The futures contract for the tech-focused Nasdaq index
  is down 0.87%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which tracks 30 large
  US companies) futures is down 0.9%. Shares in Watches of Switzerland, the
  London-listed timepiece retailer, have fallen by over 5% after Donald Trump
  hit Swiss imports to the US with a 39% tariff. Traders will be calculating
  that Watches of Switzerland will either suffer weaker US sales (American
  customers will pay the tariff, so its prices will be less competitive), or be
  forced to cut its prices in response (hitting its profits). The Falkland
  Islands is the only trading partner apart from the UK that is specified in the
  White House list as having a 10% tariff rate on its exports to the US. It is
  one of 14 British overseas territories and its top export to the US is
  non-fillet frozen fish. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity,
  it sold just under $26m (£19.6m) of the fish to the US in 2023, accounting for
  96% of its $27.4m sales to the US in 2023. The order states that goods
  imported from every nation on Earth will be subject to a 10% tariff except for
  goods from the 92 countries listed in an annex that are subject to higher
  tariff rates. Australia, which is not listed in the annex, said it assumed
  that its tariff was 10%. South Africa’s financial markets have been rattled by
  Trump’s decision to impose a 30% tariff on its exports to the US. South
  Africa’s JSE FTSE all share index has fallen by 1.2% in morning trading, with
  ‘consumer cyclicals’ the worst-performing sector. The South African rand is on
  the backfoot this morning too. It dipped to a two-month low of 18.24 against
  the US dollar, its lowest level since mid-May. Stock markets across Europe
  have dropped, after Donald Trump intensified his trade war last night.
  Germany’s DAX index has dropped by 1.1% at the start of trading in Frankfurt,
  while France’s CAC fell by almost 1% and Spain’s IBEX lost 0.6% – even though
  Europe reached a trade deal with the US at the start of this week. That, and
  the 0.5% drop on the London stock market (see here), shows concerns that
  Trump’s tariffs will weigh on the global economy, weakening trade growth.
  London’s stock market has opened in the red, as the City digests Donald
  Trump’s swathe of tariffs on trading partners. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip
  shares has dropped by over 0.5%, down 50 points at 9082 points. That’s a
  fairly mild drop, taking the ‘Footsie’ away from the record high set
  yesterday, following the modest losses in Asia-Pacific markets earlier. Tony
  Sycamore, market analyst at IG, explains: Market reactions to the newly
  announced tariffs, have been relatively subdued, largely due to recent trade
  agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea + others that have mitigated
  their impact. Mexico’s 90-day tariff reprieve and positive progress on
  US-China trade talks, as noted by President Trump, further softened the blow.
  In the currency markets, the Swiss franc has dipped against the US dollar
  after Donald Trump imposed a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland. The Swiss
  franc is down 0.15% at 0.813 per dollar. Financial experts are digesting the
  new tariff rates announced by the US last night. Jim Reid, market strategist
  at Deutsche Bank, points out that the effective US tariff rate is the highest
  since the 1930s, when the protectionist Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was in place,
  exacerbating the Great Depression. Reid explained: Welcome to August, which
  begins with the deadline now having been passed for tariff deals to be
  concluded with the United States. Much of the rhetoric and the negotiation are
  now behind us and we’ll now see how the rubber hits the road. The US tariff
  rate has risen to about 15% from a little over 2% at the start of the year.
  That’s their highest level since the 1930s but that has not prevented US
  equities from being near their all-time highs and other markets being much
  stronger this year. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at brokerage
  Pepperstone, points out that the Donald Trump failed to secure many trade
  deals during the last few months: Quite apart from the ’90 deals in 90 days’
  that the Admin had sought, what we have actually ended up with is 8 deals in
  120 days, the details of most remaining fuzzy. That’s called ‘winning’,
  apparently. Switzerland’s government has said it “notes with great regret”
  that the White House has announced a higher 39% tariff on Swiss imports to the
  United States. In a post on X, the Swiss Federal Council has said “Switzerland
  has been and continues to be in contact with the responsible authorities in
  the US,” adding that it “continues to strive for a negotiated solution”. The
  government said it would analyse the new situation and decide on how to
  proceed. Asia-Pacific stock markets are on track for their worst week since
  April (the last time Donald Trump announced a flurry of tariffs). MSCI’s
  broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has fallen 1.1% today,
  Reuters reports, bringing its total loss this week to 2.2%. That would be its
  biggest fall since the week ending on 11 April, after Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’
  tariff announcement at the start of April. Most markets across Asia are still
  showing losses today. South Korea’s KOSPI is leading the fallers, down 4%,
  after Seoul’s government rolled out plans to raise taxes on investors and
  companies. China’s CSI300 share index is down 0.75%, even though US Treasury
  Secretary Scott Bessent said yesterday that Washington and Beijing “have the
  makings of a deal”, although some details still need to be worked out. Across
  Europe, politicians are digesting the latest escalation of Donald Trump’s
  trade war. Norwegian Minister of Trade and Industry Cecilie Myrseth told
  public broadcaster NRK this morning that Norway continues to seek a trade
  agreement with the US, after the White House announced a 15% tariff on its
  exports. Further to Mark Carney saying Canada is “disappointed” at Trump’s 35%
  tariff on Canadian goods, the prime minister said the Canadian government
  “will act to project Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness,
  buy Canadian and diversity our export markets”. Carney said parts of Canada’s
  economy including lumber, steel, aluminium and automobiles were heavily
  impacted by American tariffs but despite the steep levy on US-bound Canadian
  goods outside of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Canada remained
  committed to the deal. Carney said in his statement that the US had justified
  its 35% rate on the basis of the cross-border flow of fentanyl, “despite the
  fact that Canada accounts for only 1% of US fentanyl imports and has been
  working intensively to further reduce these volumes”. We will continue working
  with the United States to stop the scourge of fentanyl and save lives in both
  our countries. Carney said Canada was also working internally to “cut down
  trade barriers to build one Canadian economy”. Canadians will be our own best
  customer, creating more well-paying careers at home, as we strengthen and
  diversify our trading partnerships throughout the world. We can give ourselves
  more than any foreign government can ever take away by building with Canadians
  workers and by using Canadian resources to benefit all Canadians. Here’s
  Carney’s statement via Bluesky: Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has said
  he is disappointed at Donald Trump raising tariffs from 25% to 35% on Canadian
  goods outside of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. More on Carney’s
  statement in a moment. Just to recap, Donald Trump signed an executive order
  on Thursday that would have new tariffs on a large array of US trading
  partners go into effect in seven days – the next step in his trade agenda that
  will test the global economy and alliances. The order was issued shortly after
  7pm, the Associated Press reports, and came after a flurry of tariff-related
  activity in recent days, as the White House announced agreements with various
  nations and blocs ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August. Also on
  Thursday, Trump announced that he would extend trade negotiations with Mexico
  for 90 days. But the vast majority of nations are continuing to face
  uncertainty ahead of the coming deadline. And while a handful of trade deals
  have also trickled in, many details remain hazy – with businesses and
  manufacturers around the world bracing for heightened operating costs and
  potential price hikes regardless. In Canada, the mayor of an Ontario city has
  expressed defiance over the 35% tariffs Donald Trump has imposed on the
  country and called for people to “buy nothing” from the US. Carolyn Parrish,
  mayor of the city of Mississauga, near Toronto, posted on X: Canada comes of
  age! 35% tariffs imposed by Trump as of midnight tonight. Time to grow up!
  Batten down the hatches and expand to new markets. Trade east west. Remove
  restrictions in our own country. Refine our own oil! Buy nothing from USA.
  Thank you Trump for a new tomorrow! Trump on Thursday increased tariffs from
  25% to 35% on all products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade
  agreement. As reported earlier, the president told NBC News on Thursday he was
  open to further discussions with Canada, adding that he may even speak with
  Canadian PM Mark Carney later in the night. Most Asian currencies slipped to
  multi-month lows on Friday, with South Korea’s won and Malaysia’s ringgit
  leading declines, as investors fled riskier regional assets after the US’s
  sweeping new tariffs. The won bore the brunt of the selloff, tumbling 0.62% to
  a two-month low of 1,400.6 against the US dollar, while the ringgit shed 0.5%
  to hit its weakest level since 23 June 23, Reuters reports. The broad-based
  retreat extended across the region, with the Philippine peso, Taiwan dollar
  and Thai baht all declining more than 0.3% as the tariff fallout rippled
  through Asian markets. The MSCI emerging market currency gauge has already
  fallen well over 1% so far this week, snapping in July from a six-month rally.
  It fell over 0.3% on Friday. Malaysia says its revised US tariff rate has been
  achieved without compromising the nation’s sovereign rights after it stood
  firm on various “red line” issues. Malaysia’s trade ministry said on Friday
  that the positive outcome of the US tariff talks followed sustained engagement
  between both governments and was a significant achievement of Malaysia’s
  thorough and methodical negotiating process, Reuters reports. The US imposed a
  19% tariff rate on Malaysia. The ministry said: We will continue to work
  closely with relevant ministries, agencies to find ways to mitigate the impact
  of tariffs on Malaysia’s exports. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand was hit
  with 15% tariffs. The country’s trade minister Todd McClay said he was hoping
  to have talks with his US counterparts. “The first step will be to talk to
  them directly. And we’ve engaged in a lot. In fact, it’s been very good
  engagement,” he told Radio New Zealand. We will be making the case about why
  this shouldn’t have happened, and engaging very, very quickly again with US
  officials to clarify this and to seek changes around the new tariffs put on
  New Zealand exporters. Local news outlet Stuff.com reported that the
  opposition Labour party’s trade spokesperson, Damien O’Connor, said the new
  tariff rate was a “slap in the face” for exporters and could lead to higher
  costs at home. There was good news for Australia in the announcements from
  Trump – in that it was not mentioned at all. Guardian Australia understands
  the US government confirmed to the Australian embassy in Washington DC that
  the baseline 10% tariff rate would remain in place. “The White House has
  confirmed that no country has reciprocal tariffs lower than Australia,” a
  spokesperson for Australia’s minister for trade, Don Farrell, said on Friday
  morning. Get the view from Australia here: Amy Hawkins, our senior China
  correspondent, has been reporting on the impact of Trump’s trade war on
  China’s fast-fashion capital Guangzhou. There, she found millions of workers
  toiling day and night in informal workshops to produce cheap garments for
  export. Business was slow, she reports: In Panyu, Yang Ruiping has run his
  small clothes factory, which specialises in tops and employs about 20 people,
  for two decades. About 30% of his orders are exported, mostly to Shein and
  Amazon, down from more than 50% before the pandemic. Although the pause in the
  trade war has eased the pressure on his business slightly, he still has
  “little confidence in the US”. “In the recent US-China trade war, if the
  tariffs go up, we need to lower the production costs to combat it,” he says.
  “It leaves little room for profit”. With no room to cut wages any lower, Yang
  says he is already losing money on every top he sells. He keeps accepting the
  orders in order to keep the factory open, but with the domestic market
  becoming increasingly competitive, he is aware he might not be able to operate
  much longer. Read the full story here: More on Cambodia now – deputy prime
  minister Sun Chanthol has thanked Donald Trump for his understanding in
  Cambodia’s negotiations to reduce a tariff rate to 19% after initially being
  set at 49% then later 36% – among the world’s highest levies, Reuters
  reporting. The news agency quoted Chanthol – Cambodia’s top trade negotiator –
  as saying in an interview: “If the US maintained 49% or 36%, that industry
  would collapse in my opinion,” referring to the garment and footwear
  manufacturing sector, the biggest economic driver in the country of 17.6
  million people. People would go to Indonesia, Vietnam ... a 16% difference
  would have been huge. We can live with 5%, anything around that. We are very
  grateful, for protecting our industry and its employees. We have close to 1
  million workers, mainly women, each one of those workers supporting four-five
  members of their family. It would have been a huge impact if this would have
  been bad. Cambodia has a big trade surplus with the US, with its exports to
  the American market accounting for 37.9% of its total shipments in 2024,
  valued at close to $10bn, according to official data. The Indian rupee was
  expected to open slightly weaker on Friday amid worries over the impact of the
  steep US tariffs on Indian exports and persistent portfolio outflows. Reuters
  reports the one-month non-deliverable forward indicated the rupee would open
  in the 87.65-87.70 range versus the US dollar, compared with 87.5950 in the
  previous session. The rupee declined about 2% in July, with Donald Trump’s
  threat of a 25% levy on Indian goods – alongside an unspecified penalty –
  pushing it closer to its all-time low of 87.95. Economists estimate the 25%
  tariff announced could shave off India’s 2025-26 growth by up to 40 basis
  points, but analysts and investors also believe India may be able to achieve a
  lower rate via negotiations. Cambodia’s deputy prime minster has said the new
  19% tariff rate protects its garment manufacturing industry with its 1 million
  workers and allows the country to be competitive with its peers. Reuters
  quotes Sun Chanthol as saying the US’s previous tariff rate – set up to 49% –
  would have caused the industry to collapse. Shares in Asia fell on Friday
  after the US hit dozens of trading partners with high tariffs. MSCI’s broadest
  index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7%, bringing the total loss
  this week to 1.8%. South Korea’s KOSPI plunged 3% while Taiwanese shares fell
  0.9%, Reuters reports. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.4%. Chinese blue chips were
  flat and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index eked out a small gain of 0.2%. “At this
  point, the reaction in markets has been modest, and I think part of the reason
  for that is the recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, and South Korea have
  certainly helped to cushion the impact,” said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG.
  The market now, I think, has probably taken the view that these trade tariff
  levels can be renegotiated, can be walked lower over the course of time. Here
  is a searchable list of the latest reciprocal tariffs announced by the White
  House: Donald Trump has said his new steep tariffs are going “very well, very
  smooth” – but that he’s open to more deals. The US president also told NBC
  News he was open to further discussions with Canada, adding that he may even
  speak with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney later in the night, Reuters
  reports. Trump signed an executive on Thursday order raising tariffs on
  Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on all products not covered by the
  US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Welcome to our live coverage of Donald
  Trump’s sweeping tariff regime. The US president signed an executive order on
  Thursday imposing reciprocal tariffs from 10% to 41% on US imports from dozens
  of countries and foreign locations. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for
  Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1
  August for striking trade deals with countries worldwide. He extended the
  deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Brazil’s
  tariff rate was set at 10%, but a previous order signed by Trump placed a 40%
  tariff on some Brazilian goods, to punish the country for prosecuting its
  former president Jair Bolsonaro over an alleged coup attempt after the 2022
  election. In other key news: Canadian imports will face tariffs of 35%, not
  the current 25%, the White House announced. Trump had threatened on Wednesday
  that Ottawa’s move to recognise a Palestinian state would make agreeing a
  trade deal “very hard”. Some of the world’s poorest and most war-torn
  countries were hit with punitive rates, including Syria, which faces a levy of
  41%; Laos and Myanmar with rates of 40%; Libya with a rate of 30%; Iraq with
  35% and Sri Lanka with 20%. Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The rates are set
  to go into effect in seven days, according to the order. Thailand’s finance
  minister said on Friday that a 19% tariff rate had been agreed – significantly
  lower than the 36% level announced in April and better aligned with other
  countries in the region. Vietnam and Indonesia reportedly negotiated tariffs
  of 20% and 19% respectively. China faces a separate deadline for its higher
  tariffs of 12 August, with an extension to the truce agreed in principle but
  yet to be approved by the White House. By 31 July just eight countries or
  economic blocs had reached formal agreements with the White House: the UK,
  Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan and the EU. –

Time to wrap up… Global markets have been rattled by a weak US jobs report which suggests Donald Trump’s trade wars have hurt America’s labor market. The latest Non-Farm Payroll report showed that the US economy added 73,000 jobs in July, far lower than expected, as the unemployment rate rose to 4.2% from 4.1% in June. The Bureau of Labor also slashed the number of jobs added in recent months. May’s jobs figure was revised down by 125,000, from 144,000 to 19,000, and June was revised down by 133,000, from 147,000 to 14,000 – a combined 258,000 fewer jobs than previously reported. Here’s the full story: The weak jobs report rocked Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average is down 496 points, or 1.1%, at 43,634 points. US bond yields also fell sharply, as traders raised their bets on cuts to US interest rates this year. Donald Trump repeated his demand for lower borrowing costs, claiming that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell was “a stubborn MORON” for not acting faster. Stocks have fallen in London, and across Europe. Investors were already anxious, after Trump announced new tariffs on dozens of US trading partners. Last night, as the latest deadline to reach deals approached, the US president signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41%. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August for striking trade deals with countries worldwide. Trump also extended the deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Our US Politics liveblog has full reaction to the jobs report, and the trade war: There’s been a heavy sell-off across European markets too, amid trade war fears and jitters about the US economy. Germany’s DAX was down around 2.5% as trading ended, with the situation in Paris even worse – France’s CAC 40 has shed 2.85%. Italy’s FTSE MIB lost 2.55%. Tariff anxiety, and the weak US jobs report, have dragged London’s stock market down to its lowest closing level in over a week. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has ended the day down 64 points, or -0.7%, at 9,068 points. That takes it away from record highs set yesterday, and is the lowest close since 23 July. Banks were among those worst hit, pounded by expectations of interest rate cuts, along with some mining companies. This post from Harvard professor Jason Furman, who chaired Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, shows how US jobs creation has been weaker this year than in 2023 and 2024: As well as demanding interest rate cuts (again) today, Donald Trump also called Fed chair Jerome Powell “a stubborn MORON”, and urged top Federal Reserve officials to seize control if Powell fails to cut borrowing costs. Here’s the full story: Stephen Miran, who chairs Donald Trump’s Council of Economic Advisors, has conceded that July’s US jobs report “isn’t ideal”. But Miran also insists that better times are ahead. Speaking to CNN, Miran suggests that more than half the downward revisions to employment growth in May and June (which cut employment totals by 258,000) were due to “quirks of the seasonal adjustment process”. He also attributes some of the drop in employment to the fact the White House has “eliminated about a million jobs for foreign born workers”, according to a transcript provided by CNN. Miran adds: Finally, we’ve been hearing a lot about uncertainty over the last few months, but that’s all resolved now. We – we’re creating trade deals left and right that have unlocked enormous new potential for the American economy. The tariff uncertainty is fading away. Tariff rates are settling in. The one big, beautiful bill is now law. There’s no more uncertainty over the tax bill either, over the – over potentially the biggest tax hike in American history. And on top of that, there are such strong, powerful incentives in the one big, beautiful bill for investment. Things like full expensing on investment in equipment, in R&amp;D, on new factory structures. These are huge. So, it’s all going to get much, much better from here. A key measure of US job creation is its weakest since early in the Covid-19 pandemic, reports Bloomberg’s Lisa Abramowicz: More bad news: economic activity in the US manufacturing sector contracted in July for the fifth month in a row. The latest poll of purchasing managers at US factories, just released by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), shows that new orders and backlogs contracted in July, suggesting a weakening in demand. Prices also rose – perhaps a sign of the impact of tariffs? – while both exports and imports contracted. This pulled the ISM’s manufacturing PMI down to 48% in July, from 49% in June. Susan Spence, chair of the ISM’s manufacturing business survey committee:, says: In July, US manufacturing activity contracted at a faster rate, with declines in the Supplier Deliveries and Employment Indexes contributing as the biggest factors in the 1-percentage point loss of the Manufacturing PMI. Some companies blamed the disruption and confusion caused by Donald Trump’s trade wars. One, in the “apparel, leather and allied products” sector, said: These tariff wars are beginning to wear us out. It’s been very difficult to forecast what we will pay in duties and calculate any cost savings we’ve had this year. Also, tariffs have disrupted our customs import bond. There is zero clarity about the future, and it’s been a difficult few months trying to figure out where everything is going to land and the impact on our business. So far, tremendous and unexpected costs have been incurred. A second, in the electrical equipment, appliances and components sector, reported: Tariffs are causing complete uncertainty around sourcing strategies. A sit-and-wait game for now. A third company, though, warned that higher interest rates were depressing the construction industry, while a fourth reported strong sales growth driven by datacenter construction. A cut to US interest rates in September looks “increasingly likely”, argues James Knightley, ING’s chief international economist. Knightley says: It is impossible to deny that the July jobs report is weak with non-farm payrolls rising 73k versus 104k consensus, but the most striking thing is the huge 258k downward revision to the past two months of data. June job gains, which were originally 147k, are now 14k and May’s initially reported gain of 144k is now 19k. This puts a completely different light on what has been happening in the US economy post the 2 April ‘Liberation Day’ announcements. Lesotho isn’t the only country to receive a reprieve from Donald Trump. As flagged earlier (see here), Lesotho was facing 50% tariffs on 2 April, an existential threat to its textile industry, but came out on Friday with a 15% rate. That’s a relief for a state which Trump said “nobody has ever heard of” when he halted USAID earlier this year. Also getting a drastic reduction in tariffs are Madagascar, down from 47% on 2 April to 15% on 1 August, and Botswana, down from 37% to 15% Liechtenstein, the wealthy European state best known as a financial centre, has seen rates slashed from 37% to 15%, while the Falkland Islands have gone from 41% to 10%. Cambodia went from 49% to 19%, while Iraq only got a four-point reduction, from 39% to 35% Ding ding goes the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange – the signal for an early burst of selling! The main US stock indices have fallen sharply at the start of trading, as investors react to the flurry of tariffs announced last night and today’s weak US jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average (which contains 30 large US companies) has fallen by 1.1% at the start of trading, shedding 501 points to 43,629. The broader S&amp;P 500 index is down 1.2%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has lost 1.5% – with Amazon falling almost 7% after issuing disappointing forecasts last night. Today’s weak payroll report has punctured the narrative of a resilient US economy, says Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, explaining: Tariffs have yet to meaningfully kick in, so the fact that jobs growth has been anemic at this early stage is worrying. As we start a new month and end the week, a new narrative about the US economy is emerging. It is one where the labour market is rapidly softening, where wage growth remains strong, which could pressurize corporate margins down the line, and where the US economy needs interest rate cuts. For now, that narrative is bad news for global stocks. Most of the 73,000 jobs created across the US economy in July were in healthcare. Today’s non-farm payroll report shows that healthcare added 55,000 jobs in July, above the average monthly gain of 42,000 over the prior 12 months. That includes 34,000 in “ambulatory health care services” and 16,000 at hospitals. Social assistance employment rose by 18,000. But on the other side of the ledger, federal government employment levels fell by 12,000 in July and are down by 84,000 since reaching a peak in January. That won’t give a full insight into Doge-related job cuts, though, as employees on paid leave or receiving ongoing severance pay are counted as employed. There was little change in employment levels in other major industries, including mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction; construction; manufacturing; wholesale trade; retail trade; transportation and warehousing; information; financial activities; professional and business services; leisure and hospitality; and other services, the Bureau for Labor Statistics adds. Today’s non-farm payrolls report does not paint a pretty picture, points out Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at investment service Wealth Club: July’s job creation is slower than expected, but the bigger news is the major revision to May and June’s job numbers which are down a combined 258,000. If Fed governors were looking for reasons to cut interest rates, this is one. The problem is that for all the extra clarity, these numbers still only show what’s happening in the rearview mirror. In hindsight, the journey so far has been bumpier and more precarious that it seemed at the time, but the road ahead is still clouded in fog. Just today, President Trump has reignited the global trade war with major knock-on effects for stock markets and the global economy. Investors and policymakers will be stuck slaloming through unexpected obstacles for some time yet. Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, fears the US jobs market will keep weakening: Not only was this a much weaker than forecast payrolls number, the monster downward revisions to the past two months inflicts a major blow to the picture of labor market robustness. What’s more concerning is that with the negative impact of tariffs only just starting to be felt, the coming months are likely to see even clearer evidence of a labor market slowdown. Of course, with Powell emphasising his focus on the unemployment rate which has only ticked up to 4.2%, perhaps it is too early to press the panic button. The shrinking of labor supply is somewhat offsetting the weakness in labor demand, keeping the labor market in an uneasy state of equilibrium. Even so, the sheer weakness of today’s payrolls number means that Powell will have to take notice. The odds of a September cut just took a big leap higher. Thomas Ryan, North America economist, agrees that today’s weak jobs report will embolden the dovish policymakers at the Federal Reserve who want to cut interest rates, saying: The weak 73,000 rise in non-farm payrolls in July, combined with large downward revisions to May and June’s gains and an uptick in the unemployment rate to 4.2%, will strengthen the case for those on the [federal open market committee of the Federal Reserve] pushing for imminent interest rate cuts. [Reminder, the Fed left rates on hold on Wednesday, in a split vote.] This chart shows just how bad the last three months have been for job creation in the US: Donald Trump has again repeated his plea for the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Shortly after today’s weak jobs report was released, Trump posted on his Truth Social site: Too Little, Too Late. Jerome “Too Late” Powell is a disaster. DROP THE RATE! The good news is that Tariffs are bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA! [Factcheck: tariffs are paid by the company or individual importing goods into the US. They only way they can “bring in dollars” is if the exporting company lowers its prices, to keep its goods competitive, meaning the importer doesn’t suffer a relative loss once it has paid the tariff.] The US dollar is being hammered on the foreign exchange markets, as today’s weak jobs report alarms traders. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, is now down 0.9% today. The euro has surged by almost a cent and a half, to $1.154, while the pound is up three-quarters of a cent at $1.328. Here’s snap reaction from Heather Long, chief economist at credit union Navy Federal: Today’s surprisingly weak US jobs report is causing ructions in the market. The yields, or interest rates, on US government bonds are falling sharply – a sign that investors are piling into bonds because they expect cuts to US interest rates to support the economy, or are simply seeking a safe-haven asset. Reuters has the details: US. Treasury yields fell after data showed on Friday the world’s largest economy created fewer jobs than expected in July, increasing the odds that the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates at the September meeting. U.S. two-year yields, which are tied to the Fed’s monetary policy, dropped 14.2 bps to 3.811%. UK government bond yields – which track the cost of Britain’s government borrowing – have also dropped. Newsflash: Employment growth across America has been much weaker than previously thought over the last three months – a sign that the US labor market may be cooling. The latest non-farm payroll, just released, shows that US employment rose by just 73,000 in July, rather weaker than the 110,000 new jobs expected. But the big shock comes in the latest revisions to payrolls, with previous estimates for both May and June being revised sharply lower. The Bureau of Labor Statistics now estimates that just 19,000 new jobs were created in May, 125,000 fewer than the 144,000 previously estimated. June’s data has been revised down too - showing that just 14,000 new jobs were created, not the 147,000 reported a month ago. That means 258,000 fewer jobs were created in May and June than previously thought. The US unemployment rate has risen to 4.2% from 4.1% in June. This surprisingly weak data may be a sign that Donald Trump’s trade wars, and the associated uncertainty, have cause more damage to the US economy than previously thought. There could also be an impact from cost-cutting DOGE program pushed by Elon Musk. The BLS says: Employment continued to trend up in health care and in social assistance. Federal government continued to lose jobs. Donald Trump’s tariff playbook is becoming clearer following last night’s announcement, says Paul Diggle, chief economist at Aberdeen Investments. This playbook consists of: A 10% global baseline tariff A rate of at least 15% on countries with goods trade deficits with the US An additional 40% on goods transhipped to evade higher rates elsewhere A variety of new country-specific rates on smaller trading partners, such as 20% on Taiwan or 39% on Switzerland Trump has also announced a 35% tariff on Canada, although the carve-out for USMCA-compliant trade remains [that’s the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement] Diggle adds that there are still plenty of uncertainties, including where US-China tariffs settle…. Last night’s tariff announcement contained some good news for the African country of Lesotho. Donald Trump has lowered Lesotho’s tariff rate to 15%, having previously threatened it with a 50% rate. That should make it easier for manufacturers in Lesotho – which last month declared a national state of disaster over the country’s “high rates of youth unemployment and job losses” – to sell their goods to American consumers. The BBC reported earlier this week that a Lesotho garment factory, which has produced Trump-branded golf shirts, was at risk of shutting down due to the high tariffs…. A quick recap. Stock markets in Europe and across Asia-Pacific countries have fallen after Donald Trump announced new tariffs on dozens of US trading partners. Last night, as the latest deadline to reach deals approached, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41%. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August for striking trade deals with countries worldwide. Trump also extended the deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Share prices have weakened in response – with Germany’s DAX down 1.9% and France’s CAC losing 2.2%, as European stock markets fell to a one-month low. Asia-Pacific stock markets were on track for their worst week since April, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 losing 0.6%, South Africa’s stock market is now down almost 1.5%. Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, said he was disappointed that Donald Trump was raising its tariffs from 25% to 35%. And there was shock in Switzerland, which has been lumbered with a 39% tariff rate – which manufacturers fear will lead to job losses. The European stock market selloff is gathering pace. After a volatile morning, Germany’s DAX index and Italy’s FTSE MIB are both down 1.9% while France’s CAC has lost 2.3%. Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at financial services group Rostro, reports that sentiment in the markets has ‘soured’ after last night’s tariff announcements from the White House. Global markets are heading lower as we close out a week of major volatility, with a raft of corporate, economic, central bank, and trade headlines hitting the newswires on a daily basis. For the most part we have seen the strength of US tech earnings and positive trade agreements helping to prop up market sentiment for many markets, although that strength has started to falter as risks grow. With the DAX falling to the lowest level in a month, we have clearly started to see sentiment sour after relative stability. The announcement of tariff levels across the globe has provided a follow up to the initial ‘Liberation Day’ cardboard cutout, with the new levels providing many with lower tariffs than had initially been set out. Notably, those rates come into play in a weeks’ time, providing hope for those seeking fresh trade agreements before the heftier tax levels come into play. Many companies will be confused about how the new US tariffs apply to them, warns Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary-general of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). Wilson explains: “At a macro level, last night’s announcement provides confirmation that the administration is set on applying generally higher tariff rates. So, the TACO logic seems to be off the menu. But at a more practical level, we still see companies struggling to understand how the country specific rates will apply in practice. The Executive Order (EO) only states the headline tariff rate, with no specifics as regards their implementation aside from the EU deal. As such, there are still widespread questions about which tariffs will stack — the Japan deal for instance is notably silent on this issue compared to the EU agreement. So, clarity on the direction of travel. But many questions remain about implementation and the real world implications.” As an example, the information released by the White House last night showed that Brazil now faced a tariff of 10%. However, on Wednesday Trump signed an executive order confirming that the US would impose 50% tariffs on Brazil. And as my colleague Lisa O’Carroll explained in her earlier post, the European Union’s trade deal with the US (a 15% tariff, agreed last weekend) is not stacked on top of a pre-existing tariff, meaning it’s a better deal than many other countries. The US dollar has hit its highest level in two months against a basket of currencies today. The dollar index has risen by 0.1%, on track for its seventh daily rise in a row. Traders may be calculating that Trump’s tariffs will be inflationary, pushing prices paid by consumers and making it harder for the US Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. They could also be factoring in the damage that the trade war will do to other countries, which could force their central banks to keep interest rates lower. Donald Trump’s decision to hit Switzerland with a 39% tariff rate has caused shock in the markets, and in the Swiss Confederation. Swiss president Karin Keller-Sutter posted on X last night that she spoke to Donald Trump on Thursday, but that the two country’s hadn’t reached an agreement. She explained: I had a final conversation today with US President Trump before the deadline for US tariffs expires. For the President, the trade deficit is the main focus. No agreement could be reached on the letter of intent negotiated between Switzerland and the USA. The Swiss government says (see earlier post) it “continues to strive for a negotiated solution” over a tariff announcement which it “notes with regret”; manufacturers are warning that jobs are at risk. Stefan Brupbacher, director of manufacturers’ association Swissmem, said: “I am stunned. These tariffs are based on no rational basis and are arbitrary. “This decision puts tens of thousands of jobs in the industry at risk.” Swissmechanic, an industry lobby group, called the 39% rate “dangerous.” It urged the government to keep negotiating in the remaining time until the tariffs are set to come into effect on 7 August, which otherwise risks leaving the economy becoming “one of the few countries that permanently struggle with structural competitive disadvantages”, Bloomberg reports. As flagged earlier, shares in Watches of Switzerland have fallen sharply in London – they’re now down almost 9%. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says Switzerland got the rough end of Trump’s trade war, explaining: The Swiss rate was a shock, and the Swiss government have said that they plan to keep negotiating with the US to secure a lower levy. Chocolatiers, watch makers and pharma companies are all under threat. Pharma accounts for 50% of Swiss exports to the US. Swiss pharma giant Novartis’s share price is lower by 2% today, while Roche is lower more than 3% on Friday. Swiss pharma giants are also pressured by Trump’s campaign to force drug makers to charge lower prices for US consumers and demanding that they charge the same rate for the US as they do for other countries. Switzerland will hope to secure the same rate as the EU, but time is running out. It appears that Switzerland may have been punished more than elsewhere because of the Swiss government’s desire to protect its openness, and to protect its domestic agriculture. Although it had said it was willing to lower import rates for fruit, nuts, shellfish and some medical devices, this was not enough for the US. Today’s selloff has dragged European stock markets down to a one-month low. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is now down 1.1% at its lowest level since late June. European pharmaceuticals stocks have dropped after Donald Trump wrote to executives at 17 companies on Thursday, demanding they match their US prices for prescription drugs with the lowest price offered in other developed nations. Taiwan’s government is hoping that it can negotiate its new US tariff down, before the new deadline of 7 August. Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te said today that the new 20% tariff rate set by the Trump administration on goods imported from the island is “temporary”, and the government expects to negotiate a lower figure. Lai also noted that rates for semiconductors, electronics as well as information and communication technology will be subject to separate U.S. sectoral tariffs and are still to be worked out. Lai told a press briefing: “The 20% tariff rate was never Taiwan’s target to begin with. We will continue negotiations and strive for a rate that’s more favourable for Taiwan.” France’s wine and spirits industry expects to lose €1bn should the US go ahead with imposing a 15% import tariff on their products next week, as the European Union makes a last-ditch effort to obtain an exemption, Bloomberg reports. The levy, due to come into force on 7 August, will likely cut a quarter of France’s annual exports from the sector, the country’s federation of wine and spirit exporters FEVS said in a statement on Friday. It will also jeopardize the jobs of the 600,000 people directly employed by the industry, they fear. FEVS President Gabriel Picard said: “We welcome the efforts already made to try to obtain the exclusion of wines and spirits from this 15% duty. “The situation cannot remain as it is. It is vital that France and the European Union actively engage with us to very concretely support our sector.” Trump’s tariffs are a huge blow to global commerce, warns Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at Berenberg bank. Bakiskan’s verdict is that that the situation is bad, but could have been even worse, explaining: The tariffs distort competition between companies that produce in the US to serve the US market relative to those that produce abroad. But many European, Japanese and South Korean-based producers compete more against each other than against US-based producers in the US market. As they all face a 15% levy, the competition between them is distorted by less than would have been the case if Trump had imposed widely different country-specific US tariffs against these key advanced economies. The US trade war has been hampering UK and eurozone manufacturers, new data shows. The latest poll of purchasing managers at British factories, just released, highlights that new orders at UK manufacturers fell in July. Data provider S&amp;P Global says: New export orders have now decreased throughout the past three-and-a-half years, with the latest decline reflecting global tariff uncertainties, ongoing administrative issues postBrexit and rising competition. There were reports of lower demand from North America, mainland Europe, the Middle East, India and mainland China. A survey of eurozone factories, also released this morning, found that their supply chains remained strained in July, with delivery times lengthening. Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, explains: “Given the fragility of the recovery, it is not demand that is causing customers to wait longer for their goods. Volatile U.S. tariff policies and uncertainty stemming from geopolitical tensions may play a key role here. We expect that companies will continue to face sudden supply chain disruptions for the foreseeable future.” President Trump’s latest flurry of tariffs implies that the US effective tariff rate will rise to about 18%, from 2.3% last year, reports Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at City consultancy Capital Economics. Brown told clients this morning: That is a little higher than we assumed and so presents modest downside risks to our forecast for global GDP growth and a small upside risk to our US inflation forecast. That said, this is unlikely to be the final word, as it still seems likely that some other countries will reach their own deals with the US, while there is a chance that the US courts will eventually strike down these tariffs. The headline 15% tariff rate applying to most EU goods is better than most countries as it is not in addition, or stacked on top of, a pre-existing tariff, say experts. That was the snap analysis of Donald Trump’s tariff list by David Henig, director at the European Centre for International Political Economy. He posted on social media: “New US tariffs dropped. Don’t be Switzerland. Do be the EU that uniquely got a concession on tariff stacking, which should but won’t silence the doomsters with no actual trade policy or geopolitical knowledge.” The EU says its pre-Trump average tariff was 4.8%, arguing therefore, that the 15%, is closer to others who have secured a 10% baseline tariff. The UK’s 10% tariff is stacked on top of the average most favoured nation tariff rate of 3.7% that applied before Trump was elected, bringing the post-Trump average to 13.7% tariff. By contrast the EU’s 15% is inclusive of the pre-Trump MFN of 4.8%. The US stock market is set to fall when trading begins in New York in five and a half hours. The futures market indictates that the S&amp;P 500 – the broad index of US stocks – is on track to fall around 0.85%. The futures contract for the tech-focused Nasdaq index is down 0.87%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which tracks 30 large US companies) futures is down 0.9%. Shares in Watches of Switzerland, the London-listed timepiece retailer, have fallen by over 5% after Donald Trump hit Swiss imports to the US with a 39% tariff. Traders will be calculating that Watches of Switzerland will either suffer weaker US sales (American customers will pay the tariff, so its prices will be less competitive), or be forced to cut its prices in response (hitting its profits). The Falkland Islands is the only trading partner apart from the UK that is specified in the White House list as having a 10% tariff rate on its exports to the US. It is one of 14 British overseas territories and its top export to the US is non-fillet frozen fish. According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, it sold just under $26m (£19.6m) of the fish to the US in 2023, accounting for 96% of its $27.4m sales to the US in 2023. The order states that goods imported from every nation on Earth will be subject to a 10% tariff except for goods from the 92 countries listed in an annex that are subject to higher tariff rates. Australia, which is not listed in the annex, said it assumed that its tariff was 10%. South Africa’s financial markets have been rattled by Trump’s decision to impose a 30% tariff on its exports to the US. South Africa’s JSE FTSE all share index has fallen by 1.2% in morning trading, with ‘consumer cyclicals’ the worst-performing sector. The South African rand is on the backfoot this morning too. It dipped to a two-month low of 18.24 against the US dollar, its lowest level since mid-May. Stock markets across Europe have dropped, after Donald Trump intensified his trade war last night. Germany’s DAX index has dropped by 1.1% at the start of trading in Frankfurt, while France’s CAC fell by almost 1% and Spain’s IBEX lost 0.6% – even though Europe reached a trade deal with the US at the start of this week. That, and the 0.5% drop on the London stock market (see here), shows concerns that Trump’s tariffs will weigh on the global economy, weakening trade growth. London’s stock market has opened in the red, as the City digests Donald Trump’s swathe of tariffs on trading partners. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has dropped by over 0.5%, down 50 points at 9082 points. That’s a fairly mild drop, taking the ‘Footsie’ away from the record high set yesterday, following the modest losses in Asia-Pacific markets earlier. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, explains: Market reactions to the newly announced tariffs, have been relatively subdued, largely due to recent trade agreements with the EU, Japan, and South Korea + others that have mitigated their impact. Mexico’s 90-day tariff reprieve and positive progress on US-China trade talks, as noted by President Trump, further softened the blow. In the currency markets, the Swiss franc has dipped against the US dollar after Donald Trump imposed a 39% tariff on imports from Switzerland. The Swiss franc is down 0.15% at 0.813 per dollar. Financial experts are digesting the new tariff rates announced by the US last night. Jim Reid, market strategist at Deutsche Bank, points out that the effective US tariff rate is the highest since the 1930s, when the protectionist Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was in place, exacerbating the Great Depression. Reid explained: Welcome to August, which begins with the deadline now having been passed for tariff deals to be concluded with the United States. Much of the rhetoric and the negotiation are now behind us and we’ll now see how the rubber hits the road. The US tariff rate has risen to about 15% from a little over 2% at the start of the year. That’s their highest level since the 1930s but that has not prevented US equities from being near their all-time highs and other markets being much stronger this year. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at brokerage Pepperstone, points out that the Donald Trump failed to secure many trade deals during the last few months: Quite apart from the ’90 deals in 90 days’ that the Admin had sought, what we have actually ended up with is 8 deals in 120 days, the details of most remaining fuzzy. That’s called ‘winning’, apparently. Switzerland’s government has said it “notes with great regret” that the White House has announced a higher 39% tariff on Swiss imports to the United States. In a post on X, the Swiss Federal Council has said “Switzerland has been and continues to be in contact with the responsible authorities in the US,” adding that it “continues to strive for a negotiated solution”. The government said it would analyse the new situation and decide on how to proceed. Asia-Pacific stock markets are on track for their worst week since April (the last time Donald Trump announced a flurry of tariffs). MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has fallen 1.1% today, Reuters reports, bringing its total loss this week to 2.2%. That would be its biggest fall since the week ending on 11 April, after Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcement at the start of April. Most markets across Asia are still showing losses today. South Korea’s KOSPI is leading the fallers, down 4%, after Seoul’s government rolled out plans to raise taxes on investors and companies. China’s CSI300 share index is down 0.75%, even though US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said yesterday that Washington and Beijing “have the makings of a deal”, although some details still need to be worked out. Across Europe, politicians are digesting the latest escalation of Donald Trump’s trade war. Norwegian Minister of Trade and Industry Cecilie Myrseth told public broadcaster NRK this morning that Norway continues to seek a trade agreement with the US, after the White House announced a 15% tariff on its exports. Further to Mark Carney saying Canada is “disappointed” at Trump’s 35% tariff on Canadian goods, the prime minister said the Canadian government “will act to project Canadian jobs, invest in our industrial competitiveness, buy Canadian and diversity our export markets”. Carney said parts of Canada’s economy including lumber, steel, aluminium and automobiles were heavily impacted by American tariffs but despite the steep levy on US-bound Canadian goods outside of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Canada remained committed to the deal. Carney said in his statement that the US had justified its 35% rate on the basis of the cross-border flow of fentanyl, “despite the fact that Canada accounts for only 1% of US fentanyl imports and has been working intensively to further reduce these volumes”. We will continue working with the United States to stop the scourge of fentanyl and save lives in both our countries. Carney said Canada was also working internally to “cut down trade barriers to build one Canadian economy”. Canadians will be our own best customer, creating more well-paying careers at home, as we strengthen and diversify our trading partnerships throughout the world. We can give ourselves more than any foreign government can ever take away by building with Canadians workers and by using Canadian resources to benefit all Canadians. Here’s Carney’s statement via Bluesky: Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has said he is disappointed at Donald Trump raising tariffs from 25% to 35% on Canadian goods outside of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. More on Carney’s statement in a moment. Just to recap, Donald Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that would have new tariffs on a large array of US trading partners go into effect in seven days – the next step in his trade agenda that will test the global economy and alliances. The order was issued shortly after 7pm, the Associated Press reports, and came after a flurry of tariff-related activity in recent days, as the White House announced agreements with various nations and blocs ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August. Also on Thursday, Trump announced that he would extend trade negotiations with Mexico for 90 days. But the vast majority of nations are continuing to face uncertainty ahead of the coming deadline. And while a handful of trade deals have also trickled in, many details remain hazy – with businesses and manufacturers around the world bracing for heightened operating costs and potential price hikes regardless. In Canada, the mayor of an Ontario city has expressed defiance over the 35% tariffs Donald Trump has imposed on the country and called for people to “buy nothing” from the US. Carolyn Parrish, mayor of the city of Mississauga, near Toronto, posted on X: Canada comes of age! 35% tariffs imposed by Trump as of midnight tonight. Time to grow up! Batten down the hatches and expand to new markets. Trade east west. Remove restrictions in our own country. Refine our own oil! Buy nothing from USA. Thank you Trump for a new tomorrow! Trump on Thursday increased tariffs from 25% to 35% on all products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. As reported earlier, the president told NBC News on Thursday he was open to further discussions with Canada, adding that he may even speak with Canadian PM Mark Carney later in the night. Most Asian currencies slipped to multi-month lows on Friday, with South Korea’s won and Malaysia’s ringgit leading declines, as investors fled riskier regional assets after the US’s sweeping new tariffs. The won bore the brunt of the selloff, tumbling 0.62% to a two-month low of 1,400.6 against the US dollar, while the ringgit shed 0.5% to hit its weakest level since 23 June 23, Reuters reports. The broad-based retreat extended across the region, with the Philippine peso, Taiwan dollar and Thai baht all declining more than 0.3% as the tariff fallout rippled through Asian markets. The MSCI emerging market currency gauge has already fallen well over 1% so far this week, snapping in July from a six-month rally. It fell over 0.3% on Friday. Malaysia says its revised US tariff rate has been achieved without compromising the nation’s sovereign rights after it stood firm on various “red line” issues. Malaysia’s trade ministry said on Friday that the positive outcome of the US tariff talks followed sustained engagement between both governments and was a significant achievement of Malaysia’s thorough and methodical negotiating process, Reuters reports. The US imposed a 19% tariff rate on Malaysia. The ministry said: We will continue to work closely with relevant ministries, agencies to find ways to mitigate the impact of tariffs on Malaysia’s exports. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand was hit with 15% tariffs. The country’s trade minister Todd McClay said he was hoping to have talks with his US counterparts. “The first step will be to talk to them directly. And we’ve engaged in a lot. In fact, it’s been very good engagement,” he told Radio New Zealand. We will be making the case about why this shouldn’t have happened, and engaging very, very quickly again with US officials to clarify this and to seek changes around the new tariffs put on New Zealand exporters. Local news outlet Stuff.com reported that the opposition Labour party’s trade spokesperson, Damien O’Connor, said the new tariff rate was a “slap in the face” for exporters and could lead to higher costs at home. There was good news for Australia in the announcements from Trump – in that it was not mentioned at all. Guardian Australia understands the US government confirmed to the Australian embassy in Washington DC that the baseline 10% tariff rate would remain in place. “The White House has confirmed that no country has reciprocal tariffs lower than Australia,” a spokesperson for Australia’s minister for trade, Don Farrell, said on Friday morning. Get the view from Australia here: Amy Hawkins, our senior China correspondent, has been reporting on the impact of Trump’s trade war on China’s fast-fashion capital Guangzhou. There, she found millions of workers toiling day and night in informal workshops to produce cheap garments for export. Business was slow, she reports: In Panyu, Yang Ruiping has run his small clothes factory, which specialises in tops and employs about 20 people, for two decades. About 30% of his orders are exported, mostly to Shein and Amazon, down from more than 50% before the pandemic. Although the pause in the trade war has eased the pressure on his business slightly, he still has “little confidence in the US”. “In the recent US-China trade war, if the tariffs go up, we need to lower the production costs to combat it,” he says. “It leaves little room for profit”. With no room to cut wages any lower, Yang says he is already losing money on every top he sells. He keeps accepting the orders in order to keep the factory open, but with the domestic market becoming increasingly competitive, he is aware he might not be able to operate much longer. Read the full story here: More on Cambodia now – deputy prime minister Sun Chanthol has thanked Donald Trump for his understanding in Cambodia’s negotiations to reduce a tariff rate to 19% after initially being set at 49% then later 36% – among the world’s highest levies, Reuters reporting. The news agency quoted Chanthol – Cambodia’s top trade negotiator – as saying in an interview: “If the US maintained 49% or 36%, that industry would collapse in my opinion,” referring to the garment and footwear manufacturing sector, the biggest economic driver in the country of 17.6 million people. People would go to Indonesia, Vietnam ... a 16% difference would have been huge. We can live with 5%, anything around that. We are very grateful, for protecting our industry and its employees. We have close to 1 million workers, mainly women, each one of those workers supporting four-five members of their family. It would have been a huge impact if this would have been bad. Cambodia has a big trade surplus with the US, with its exports to the American market accounting for 37.9% of its total shipments in 2024, valued at close to $10bn, according to official data. The Indian rupee was expected to open slightly weaker on Friday amid worries over the impact of the steep US tariffs on Indian exports and persistent portfolio outflows. Reuters reports the one-month non-deliverable forward indicated the rupee would open in the 87.65-87.70 range versus the US dollar, compared with 87.5950 in the previous session. The rupee declined about 2% in July, with Donald Trump’s threat of a 25% levy on Indian goods – alongside an unspecified penalty – pushing it closer to its all-time low of 87.95. Economists estimate the 25% tariff announced could shave off India’s 2025-26 growth by up to 40 basis points, but analysts and investors also believe India may be able to achieve a lower rate via negotiations. Cambodia’s deputy prime minster has said the new 19% tariff rate protects its garment manufacturing industry with its 1 million workers and allows the country to be competitive with its peers. Reuters quotes Sun Chanthol as saying the US’s previous tariff rate – set up to 49% – would have caused the industry to collapse. Shares in Asia fell on Friday after the US hit dozens of trading partners with high tariffs. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7%, bringing the total loss this week to 1.8%. South Korea’s KOSPI plunged 3% while Taiwanese shares fell 0.9%, Reuters reports. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.4%. Chinese blue chips were flat and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index eked out a small gain of 0.2%. “At this point, the reaction in markets has been modest, and I think part of the reason for that is the recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, and South Korea have certainly helped to cushion the impact,” said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG. The market now, I think, has probably taken the view that these trade tariff levels can be renegotiated, can be walked lower over the course of time. Here is a searchable list of the latest reciprocal tariffs announced by the White House: Donald Trump has said his new steep tariffs are going “very well, very smooth” – but that he’s open to more deals. The US president also told NBC News he was open to further discussions with Canada, adding that he may even speak with Canadian prime minister Mark Carney later in the night, Reuters reports. Trump signed an executive on Thursday order raising tariffs on Canadian goods to 35% from 25% on all products not covered by the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff regime. The US president signed an executive order on Thursday imposing reciprocal tariffs from 10% to 41% on US imports from dozens of countries and foreign locations. Rates were set at 25% for India, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa ahead of Trump’s self-imposed deadline of 1 August for striking trade deals with countries worldwide. He extended the deadline for a tariff agreement with Mexico by another 90 days. Brazil’s tariff rate was set at 10%, but a previous order signed by Trump placed a 40% tariff on some Brazilian goods, to punish the country for prosecuting its former president Jair Bolsonaro over an alleged coup attempt after the 2022 election. In other key news: Canadian imports will face tariffs of 35%, not the current 25%, the White House announced. Trump had threatened on Wednesday that Ottawa’s move to recognise a Palestinian state would make agreeing a trade deal “very hard”. Some of the world’s poorest and most war-torn countries were hit with punitive rates, including Syria, which faces a levy of 41%; Laos and Myanmar with rates of 40%; Libya with a rate of 30%; Iraq with 35% and Sri Lanka with 20%. Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The rates are set to go into effect in seven days, according to the order. Thailand’s finance minister said on Friday that a 19% tariff rate had been agreed – significantly lower than the 36% level announced in April and better aligned with other countries in the region. Vietnam and Indonesia reportedly negotiated tariffs of 20% and 19% respectively. China faces a separate deadline for its higher tariffs of 12 August, with an extension to the truce agreed in principle but yet to be approved by the White House. By 31 July just eight countries or economic blocs had reached formal agreements with the White House: the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan and the EU. – With Helen Livingstone, Lisa O’Carroll and agencies
