  A season opener with rustiness abounding was heading Brighton’s way. Then came
  echoes of last season, when 22 points were conceded from winning positions.
  Once Matt O’Riley had slotted a penalty after Sander Berge’s ill-judged
  challenge, Fulham had to wait for the 95th minute for a genuine chance.
  Volleyed wide by an aghast Kenny Tete it would not be the last, Rodrigo Muniz
  smashing in a Harry Wilson corner to equalise. The ball had been allowed to
  travel to the second-half sub on the back post. Muniz, one of many strikers
  linked with Newcastle, and this week linked with Atalanta and Champions League
  football, chested down to crash home. The delighted away fans implored the
  Brazilian to stay. “He’s very strong,” said Marco Silva, the Fulham manager.
  “Rodrigo created something with the fans that is not easy to do.” For transfer
  devotees, the other major news had been Carlos Baleba starting in Brighton’s
  midfield; the expectation is he stays, give or take a steeple-high offer Tony
  Bloom cannot refuse. Within an aggressive midfield battle, Baleba’s quality
  was often a cut above. His defensive work was missed once subbed off in the
  second half. “Good against the ball, he needs to be better in possession,” was
  Fabian Hürzeler’s verdict. “We are very pleased he is a Brighton player, we
  want to go with him to the next step, he can be very important for us this
  season.” While the Premier League’s upper class lavish huge sums, there was
  just one new signing in either of these two members of the squeezed middle’s
  starting teams. Maxim De Cuyper, the left-back signed via Brighton’s regular
  Belgian trade route, completed the 90. “Very mature,” said Hürzeler of the new
  man. For Fulham where only the reserve goalkeeper, Benjamin Lecomte, was a new
  face, novelty was offered by Josh King, 18, showing high promise. “A very good
  performance,” said Silva. “He’s a top talent player, I didn’t have any
  reservations on picking him.” The teenager showed off impressive ball-carrying
  chops while both teams were otherwise rushed in attempting to create
  opportunities. The best chance of the first half came when O’Riley whipped the
  ball for Kaoru Mitoma to head over, the type of chance a centre-forward like
  Danny Welbeck, on the bench, might gobble up. Georgino Rutter was playing the
  role vacated by João Pedro’s sale, with O’Riley assuming penalty duties. On
  the sidelines, Silva kept his usual morose vigil while Hürzeler anxiously
  split his time between bench and technical area. Hürzeler is 32 but is a young
  man in a hurry, his summer pursuits including Spanish lessons. “For sure it
  feels painful,” he said, happy enough with his team’s performance until those
  fateful final seconds. “It’s really important to take the positives away. We
  played well and defended good. We should score the second goal and I think the
  game would be over. That’s football.” Silva is in the final year of his Fulham
  contract with barely concealed irritation at the “passive”, to use his word,
  lack of arrivals, but was happy enough with the team he fights on with. “I
  think it’s a fair result,” he said. “The only difference before we came back
  again was the penalty.” Brighton broke the deadlock after Rutter was allowed
  far too much space to surge into the box; Berge was unduly clumsy. O’Riley
  swept low and left, Bernd Leno offered no answer to a player linked with
  Juventus. As Brighton increasingly looked to the counter, Silva was in the
  process of throwing on three changes, including Muniz, when Yankuba Minteh
  blazed over a chance, created by Mitoma’s speed, that might have clinched
  victory. That hastened Brighton’s changes, Baleba off for Diego Gómez. The
  Paraguayan showed considerable attacking prowess while struggling to meet the
  defensive detail. James Milner, who hits 40 in January, also arrived, and was
  unable to stem the Fulham flow. Silva threw on Emile Smith Rowe for King,
  departing to an ovation. It was Smith Rowe who forced the corner from which
  his team equalised. As 90 minutes arrived, another sub, Brajan Gruda, blew the
  latest decent Brighton chance, caught in two minds, a familiar moment they
  would come to regret.
