  Ethel Caterham, the last surviving Edwardian and the world’s oldest living
  person, celebrated her 116th birthday on Thursday. She was born on 21 August
  1909 in Shipton Bellinger, Hampshire, when Herbert Asquith was prime minister,
  Beatrix Potter had just published The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies and one of
  the bestselling songs was Shine on Harvest Moon. Caterham is the last
  surviving subject of Edward VII, who died on 6 May 1910. She was born five
  years before the start of the first world war, the second youngest of eight
  siblings. The Edwardian era was described by the American writer Samuel Hynes
  as a “leisurely time when women wore picture hats and did not vote, when the
  rich were not ashamed to live conspicuously, and the sun never set on the
  British flag”. Caterham became the oldest living person in April after the
  death of Sister Inah Canabarro Lucas, a Brazilian nun, at 116. She told the
  BBC in 2020 that she took “everything in my stride, the highs and lows”. She
  said: “I listen and I do what I like.” She will celebrate her birthday at the
  care home in Lightwater, Surrey, where she lives and will take the day “at her
  own pace” surrounded by her family. She has been a widow for almost half a
  century after the death of her husband, Norman, in 1976. According to the
  Gerontology Research Group, she met Norman, a major in the British army, at a
  dinner party in 1931. They were stationed in Hong Kong and Gibraltar and had
  two children. A spokesperson for her care home said: “Ethel and her family are
  so grateful for all of the kind messages and interest shown to her as she
  celebrates her 116th birthday this year. “Ethel has again chosen not to give
  any interviews, preferring to spend the day quietly with her family so that
  she can enjoy it at her own pace. The king may be her one concession,
  understandably. Thank you again for your kind wishes on this special day.”
  Last year King Charles sent Caterham a card to mark her 115th birthday. The
  title of the oldest person ever is held by Jeanne Calment, a French woman who
  lived to 122 years and 164 days, according to Guinness World Records. What was
  happening in August 1909? Herbert Henry Asquith was the UK’s Liberal prime
  minister and Edward VII was king. William Howard Taft was the US president and
  Alfred Deakin was serving as Australia’s prime minister for the third time.
  The UK’s first state pensions were being paid after the introduction of the
  Old Age Pensions Act. Claude Monet’s Water Lilies series had just gone on show
  for the first time at an exhibition in Paris. General Electric patented the
  electric toaster invented by Frank Shailor. Bulgaria was about to declare
  independence from the Ottoman empire. Manchester United had won the first of
  their FA Cup victories by beating Bristol City. Arthur Gore was the reigning
  men’s Wimbledon champion aged 41 – he remains the men’s singles tournament’s
  oldest winner. The future matinee idol Errol Flynn was two months old. The
  first international flying show occurred in Reims, France. Selfridges had just
  opened on Oxford Street in London.
