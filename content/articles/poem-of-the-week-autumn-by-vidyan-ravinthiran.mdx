  Autumn (after John Keats) The fallen yellow leaves now oftener flare red.
  Embers. Blown-up chilli-flakes. The burning of the library at Jaffna. Foreign
  dead about to break the spell of here and now. Phantasms steal into the
  peaceful lives we seem to have earned, telling tales about what happened to
  them, not us, and in a tongue I never learned. This is my garden, my spade of
  blood meal and from our kitchen the time-travelling smell of chicken curry
  floats to Walden Pond. – A swooping cardinal like a struck match. Above the
  fence mosquitoes eddy like opinion, crazed by a patch, of red-pink light into
  giddy scribbling on the air. There is no need to be ashamed. I see you there
  and keep alive the thought of meeting one day brightly after the next. Black
  mustard seed thrums in the sauce, the sky falls asleep; where feelings come
  from or may leap across and through and to no one can say. Tsunami-hit, shoved
  over at a tilt, they’ve left the bashed old kovil’s god-thronged tower
  standing tallish, beyond the new one built to face, this time, becalm, the
  ocean’s power … Our autumn clouds are a far-quarried rubble to which the
  changing light does spicy things. To sing, to fly, migrate, are curious verbs;
  beauty, like happiness, frailly reliable, has nothing to do with why there are
  wings, why birds build nests and sing their songs, or why barbed wire’s
  besotted with its barbs. Contemporary poetry collections often fall into one
  of two dominant categories. One kind travels thoughtfully, claiming spaces in
  an unfamiliar elsewhere, the other stays at home, revisiting and refining
  material that’s more familiar. Avidyā, Vidyan Ravinthiran’s latest, represents
  for me the exploratory kind, a tour that skirts the flames of history in a
  relaxed almost self-effacing manner. This is especially true of Autumn. The
  subtitle’s qualification after slyly denotes the time and distance between the
  two poems. Keats wrote his ode To Autumn on 19 September 1819. The
  England-born Sri Lankan poet is writing more than two centuries later; since
  Keats’s time Sri Lanka has been colonised by the British, granted
  independence, endured civil war and seen terrible reprisals against the Tamil
  Tigers for their armed struggle for independence. The autumnal redness the
  poem evokes soon turns to fire. A rhythm of stops and starts underlines the
  threat: “The fallen yellow leaves now oftener / flare red. Embers. Blown-up
  chilli-flakes. / The burning of the library at Jaffna.” Keats, reading over
  the poet’s shoulder, might remember Peterloo (critics have found that massacre
  in his ode’s possible subtext of “surveillance”) and realise that the 21st
  century poet is also witness to less than “mellow fruitfulness”. Autumn soon
  reveals the violent biblioclasm of 1981 when Jaffna Public Library, one of the
  biggest libraries in Asia and a major Tamil cultural centre, was burned down
  by a mob that included police and paramilitaries. But it isn’t books and
  buildings alone that have been destroyed. The shapes emerging from the poet’s
  past become the “foreign dead”, the “phantasms” that “steal / into the
  peaceful lives we seem to have earned.” Those phantasms give their version of
  events (“telling tales”), further distancing the poet by speaking “in a tongue
  I never learned”. The ensuing jump of imagery, from the “garden” declared his
  own, to the necessary “spade of blood meal” is effectively plotted. Danger is
  diffused by the magic, humour and resistance found in cookery. In many
  cultures, families and societies come together to eat “grief food”. The
  instant “chilli-flakes” evoked earlier are an acknowledgment of cultural
  compromises. Then a further unexpected move occurs: “and from our kitchen the
  time-travelling smell / of chicken curry floats to Walden Pond”. There’s no
  abruptness; the translation from the poet’s garden where he now lives in the
  US to Thoreau’s retreat is amused, peaceable, sensuous. Choosing, as Keats
  chose, the subversively 11-lined stanza, Ravinthiran further complicates its
  balance. A clearcut, almost emphatically rhymed ABAB quatrain evolves into the
  looser assembly of seven lines whose rhymes may sound out less distinctly.
  Stanza two introduces a brilliant short film of the cardinal’s swoop and the
  responsive movement of mosquitoes that “eddy / like opinion.” That nicely
  poised, concrete-abstract simile is followed by the rather more Keatsian image
  of the insects “scribbling on the air”. Keats’s poem always addresses Autumn.
  Who is Ravinthiran addressing with “There is no need / to be ashamed”? The
  tone sounds loving, even lover-like, with its note of future expectation. But
  perhaps the “you” is the poem, or the poet courting his muse? “You” might also
  be the “phantasms” who have helplessly spoken in a strange “tongue”.
  Ravinthiran’s poetic “courtship” is oblique, questioning, almost shy: “where
  feelings come from or may leap / across and through and to no one can say.”
  Those monosyllables form little uneven stepping stones in a swashing river.
  After that, the picture enlarges dramatically with the tsunami of 2004, the
  Dravidian temple, “the old kovil’s god-thronged tower” and the defensive
  new-build. These lines extend history and still find it dangerous. Conflict is
  suggested: the sunset’s clouds are “a far-quarried rubble” and there may be no
  comfort in the assertion that “the light does spicy things” to them.
  Open-winged birds of possibility still circle. The conflation of truth and
  beauty is gently queried: the beauty of birds is mechanism, the poet says, as
  he hooks the reader sharply down to earth with the marriage of “verbs” and
  “barbs”. The personification of barbed wire as a narcissist fixes in a single
  line the worst of human nature. A tyrannical border splices the garden, its
  fragrances and reconciliations. Those barbs may presage a deeper colour of
  autumnal red.
