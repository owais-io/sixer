  ultimately marked his card

  At their very best, Simon Goodwin’s Demons would fight hand to hand, square
  metre by square metre. Their midfielders were like snorting bulls. Their
  ruckman was peerless. Their key defenders would patrol and gobble, deny and
  thwart. In just under an hour, it all came together in a flawless, torrential,
  still scarcely believable flood of goals. At their very worst, Goodwin’s
  Demons were rigid, predictable, boring. They would blast and hope. They’d win
  the inside 50s and contested possession count and lose the match. While the
  rest of us stifled yawns, Goodwin would shrug his shoulders, shuffle his
  papers and talk about “learnings” and “contest and defence” and “honest
  conversations”. A week later, they’d be losing the same way and he’d be saying
  the same things. But the very worst of what was happening had nothing to with
  the gameplan or the forward connection. It was the club itself. It was the way
  they were constantly having to douse fires. It was the teammates brawling
  outside restaurants. It was the investigative reporters looking for dirt. It
  was the independent politicians potting them under parliamentary privilege. It
  was the allegations of drug use. It was the shoddy messaging. It was the
  leaks. It was the leadership vacuum. Last summer, they were desperate for a
  clean slate. They thrashed it all out at the foot of Melbourne’s snowfields.
  There was talk of “trauma”, of “cleansing” and lots of tears, hugs and vows to
  start anew. They locked down a new theme for the year – Love. Play. Celebrate.
  Forgive my cynicism, but it sounded like the intersection of LinkedIn and a
  MAFS dinner party. They promptly went and lost their first five games. “It’ll
  turn,” Goodwin insisted. And they played some excellent football, beating
  Brisbane at the Gabba, smashing Sydney and running Collingwood and Adelaide
  close. But then they encountered Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera. As the St Kilda star
  played one of the great individual quarters, Melbourne’s leaders, on the field
  and on the bench, looked like they didn’t know what day it was. Everything
  always seemed so laboured at Melbourne. Everything – from the way they’d win
  the ball, to the way they’d move it, to the way they’d explain themselves
  afterwards – seemed like hard work. And with the chair on holiday and the CEO
  yet to start his role, so much of the burden fell on Max Gawn. After each
  loss, he’d gather his team, peer down on them and nod towards the race.
  Sometimes he’d cop the abuse from the performative clowns filming their own
  rants. He had to then stick up for the coach, the gameplan, his wayward
  teammates. He had to be president, CEO, champion player, diffuser and
  marketer. He then had to go on radio with the likes of Marty Sheargold and
  gently flick him down to fine leg. Ten weeks after their premiership, in the
  first week of summer, the Melbourne faithful gathered at the MCG. It wasn’t
  like the drunken euphoria at the Whitten Oval in 2016, or the bonnet-hopping
  mayhem on Swan Street the following year. It was clearer, more sober. It had
  sunk in by now. They watched the replay and started cheering four or five
  seconds before each goal. This time, the coach wasn’t bumped off stage by the
  mayor of Perth. Goodwin stressed the importance of capitalising on their
  talent, their youth, and of winning a flag at the MCG in front of their fans.
  But they never got there. This was a distracted, scrambling club. They paid
  big bucks for Brodie Grundy, who ended up adrift in the system, playing in
  mini typhoons out at Casey Fields. They lost four finals by a total of 40
  points. Against Collingwood in 2023, they had 32 more inside 50s. But they
  shot themselves in the foot with dinky little nine iron lobs, shanks out on
  the full, forwards barrelling into one another. A week later, they had 10 more
  scoring shots than Carlton. They had a goal annulled. Their last five shots on
  goal were behinds. And they frittered away so many others. None of this should
  detract from what Goodwin achieved in 2021, and what he will mean to this club
  for decades to come. And he deserves enormous credit for maintaining his
  dignity amid all the rumours, the spot fires and the chaos around him. But
  there will always be the nagging question of what could and should have been –
  if the club was stable, if its leaders could use proper sentences, if Angus
  Brayshaw hadn’t been knocked into retirement, if his players could kick
  straight, if they could convert midfield dominance into goals. Some of that
  was clearly beyond his control. But too often it was the result of
  unimaginative coaching, of a gameplan from another place and time, a gameplan
  that gradually wore his players down and ultimately marked his card. This is
  an extract from Guardian Australia’s free weekly AFL email, From the Pocket.
