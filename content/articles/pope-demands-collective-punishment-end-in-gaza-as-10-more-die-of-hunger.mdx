  Ten Palestinians, including two children, have died from starvation in the
  last 24 hours, the health authorities in Gaza said on Wednesday, as Pope Leo
  XIV demanded that Israel stop its “collective punishment” of the population in
  the besieged territory. At least 313 people have died from hunger, including
  119 children, since the war in Gaza began and Israel intensified its siege on
  the Palestinian territory. Last week a UN-backed monitoring body confirmed
  that Gaza was in the throes of famine, warning that without more aid
  increasing numbers of people would lose access to food. As humanitarian
  conditions continued to worsen, the pope called for a suspension of
  hostilities. “I beg for a permanent ceasefire to be reached, the safe entry of
  humanitarian aid to be facilitated and humanitarian law to be fully
  respected,” Leo said. He referred to international law and its “prohibition of
  collective punishment, indiscriminate use of force and the forced displacement
  of the population”. The pope was interrupted twice by applause as he called
  for a ceasefire in front of thousands of people in the Vatican auditorium.
  Despite calls for a ceasefire, Israeli tanks rolled into the outskirts of Gaza
  City overnight, destroying houses and displacing residents. Tanks shelled the
  Ebad al-Rahman neighbourhood on the northern outskirts of the city, causing
  injuries, as Israeli forces sought to clear a path into Gaza City before its
  expected offensive. Israeli strikes and fire killed at least 76 people
  throughout Gaza in the previous 24 hours, the Gaza health authorities said.
  The Israeli military said that it was operating in Jabaliya and on the
  outskirts of Gaza City to “dismantle terror infrastructure sites and eliminate
  terrorists”. It claimed to have killed a senior Hamas member, Mahmoud
  al-Aswad, who was the militia’s head of intelligence for west Gaza. Israel has
  said that it will launch its new offensive in Gaza City regardless of whether
  a ceasefire is reached, describing the city as Hamas’s last stronghold in the
  strip. The city has become densely populated during the war as Palestinians
  fled from other areas. Gaza City now holds about 1 million people – half the
  population of the strip – who Israel said will be ordered to leave.
  Humanitarians have warned that such mass forcible displacement is not only
  against international law, but would exacerbate already dismal humanitarian
  conditions in Gaza. Israel has brushed off such concerns, with an Israeli
  military spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, saying on Wednesday that “evacuating
  Gaza City is inevitable”. Israel has already asked humanitarians in the north
  and south of Gaza to prepare for an influx of people and said that increased
  number of tents had been sent to the territory. “Before transitioning to the
  next phase in the war, I wish to confirm that there are vast empty areas in
  the southern strip, just as is the case in the central camps and in al-Mawasi.
  These areas are free of tents,” said Adraee, sharing a map of separate,
  discrete “empty zones” in southern Gaza. Thousands of Gaza City’s residents
  have already left, fleeing intensifying Israeli bombardment. However, local
  church leaders said that they would not leave and that people sheltering in
  the churches were too weak and malnourished to move and displacement would be
  “a death sentence”. “For this reason, the clergy and nuns have decided to
  remain and continue to care for all those who will be in the compounds,” said
  the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate and the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in a
  joint statement. The Israeli military has regularly published evacuation
  orders over the last 22 months in Gaza, and much of the population has been
  displaced several times. More than 80% of Gaza is designated as an Israeli
  military zone or subject to displacement orders, the UN said in June.
  Continued displacement has exacerbated health and sanitary conditions, leading
  to the spread of disease. Israel has yet to respond to a US-backed ceasefire
  proposal, despite Hamas having agreed to it last week. The proposal is
  reportedly almost identical to an earlier US proposal that Israel had
  previously accepted. On Tuesday night, an Israeli security cabinet meeting was
  held without discussing the ceasefire proposal. Israeli media has claimed that
  the government of Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer interested in a ceasefire,
  and instead wants a comprehensive end to the war including the return of all
  hostages and the departure of Hamas from Gaza. Qatar, one of the mediators for
  ceasefire talks, issued a rare rebuke of Israel on Tuesday, saying that Israel
  “does not want to reach an agreement”. Donald Trump was reportedly planning to
  lead a meeting to discuss the postwar future of Gaza at the White House on
  Wednesday. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that Washington expected the
  war in Gaza to be settled by the end of the year. Witkoff told Fox News on
  Tuesday that the White House meeting would discuss “a very comprehensive plan
  we’re putting together on the next day”. The US state department also said
  that the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, would meet Israel’s foreign
  minister, Gideon Saar, in Washington. The war in Gaza has killed at least
  62,895 Palestinians over the last 22 months, according to Gaza’s health
  ministry. Israel launched its war after Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200
  people on October 7 2023.
