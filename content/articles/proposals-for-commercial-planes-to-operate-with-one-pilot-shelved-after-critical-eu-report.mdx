  critical EU report

  Proposals for commercial aeroplanes to operate with just one pilot in the
  cockpit have been put on ice after a report for the European regulator
  suggested it would make flying more dangerous. A three-year research project
  into “extended minimum crew operations” commissioned by the EU Aviation Safety
  Agency (Easa) found that despite advances in technology there was not
  sufficient evidence that flying with a single pilot could be as safe as with
  the two currently required. The verdict has been welcomed by pilots’ groups,
  which had campaigned against potential changes to the rules. Although airlines
  and manufacturers have not publicly argued for fewer pilots, the current
  cockpit design and regulations on maximum flying times mean three or four are
  required on long-haul flights. The report for Easa concluded that with fewer
  crew “an equivalent level of safety [with] the current two-crew operations
  cannot be sufficiently demonstrated”. That applied even to scenarios where two
  pilots were in the cockpit for take-off and landing but a co-pilot could rest
  as an aircraft cruised on autopilot. The Easa report said: “Development of
  cockpit technology and further research will be needed before exploring the
  feasibility of such operational concepts.” It highlighted issues such as
  “pilot incapacitation monitoring, fatigue and drowsiness, sleep inertia” as
  well as the cross-checks carried out by two pilots working together. The
  report alluded to a longer-term potential “smart cockpit” taking over more of
  the pilots’ workload, with technology to monitor human alertness, that “may
  have the potential to set the basis for new operational concepts”, but it said
  this would also need “a solution to prevent security threats”. The security of
  the cockpit has been difficult to resolve: reinforced doors were introduced
  after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 to prevent entry. However, in the
  2015 Germanwings plane crash the co-pilot used the locked door to keep the
  captain away from the flight deck. The European Cockpit Association,
  representing pilot unions across Europe, said the report was a “reality check”
  and welcomed it as independent validation of its safety concerns. It had
  warned in campaigns that aircraft manufacturers and airlines were pushing for
  flights with only one pilot at the controls. A spokesperson said: “The reality
  is that manufacturers and avionics developers remain deeply engaged in
  advancing technologies aimed at removing one pilot from the cockpit. This Easa
  study offers a clear reality check on the safety case. While the conclusions
  confirm and reinforce our existing concerns, the underlying motivations behind
  the push for reduced crew operations are still very much present.” The
  aircraft manufacturer Airbus said it was “constantly looking for ways to
  improve and advance its range of products to enhance safety, efficiency and
  performance”. A spokesperson added: “For the foreseeable future, this means
  having a well-rested and competent human pilot in command of a robust and
  flexible system, including appropriate automation. We believe that pilots will
  remain at the heart of operations and that automation can play a crucial role
  by assisting them in the cockpit and reducing workload.” Easa said there was
  no timeline in place for changing the rules. A spokesperson said the agency
  had always considered single-pilot operations “extremely complex and not
  foreseeable in the next decade”. It said a smart cockpit “might have the
  potential to set the basis for new operational concepts such as extended
  minimum crew operations. However, any consideration of this will depend on the
  new technologies first proving their safety benefit … when applied in the
  current two-pilot operations.” The Easa report was published in the wake of
  the Air India crash, which has cast new fears over aviation safety and the
  role of the pilots in preventing or contributing to accidents. Martin Chalk,
  an ex-BA pilot and formerly the general secretary of the pilots’ union Balpa,
  said: “Having two pilots obviously did not stop the Air India crash – but if
  this is a human factors issue, a single pilot is certainly not going to help.
  And if there are concerns from a mental health point of view, spending more
  time alone in the cockpit is the worst thing you could do.” A spokesperson for
  Iata, the global airlines trade body, said it did “not see significant demand
  or momentum toward single-pilot operations in commercial aviation”, adding:
  “Aircraft flying today were designed and certified for two-pilot operations.
  Many of these aircraft will remain in service for the next 25 years,
  reinforcing the continued relevance of the two-pilot model.”
