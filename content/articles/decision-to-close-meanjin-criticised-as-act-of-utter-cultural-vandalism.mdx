  One of Australia’s longest running literary journals has been scrapped, in
  what has been described as an act of “utter cultural vandalism” on the part of
  the University of Melbourne. After 85 years, Meanjin, run by the university’s
  subsidiary Melbourne University Publishing (MUP), will publish its last
  edition in December. Although the journal’s editor, Esther Anatolitis, worked
  her last day at Meanjin on Thursday, the spring and summer quarterly editions
  of the journal are already at the printers. In a statement, the MUP chair,
  Prof Warren Bebbington, confirmed Meanjin’s demise, saying it was “a matter of
  deep regret”. “The decision was made on purely financial grounds, the board
  having found it no longer viable to produce the magazine ongoing,” the
  statement said. “The two part-time staff of Meanjin were not involved in the
  decision, which led to their being made redundant this week.” Bebbington told
  Guardian Australia that MUP and Anatolitis, who was contacted by the Guardian
  but declined to comment, had agreed to the wording of the statement, and he
  declined to confirm that the editor had signed a non-disclosure agreement as
  part of her redundancy package. Bebbington also scotched speculation that any
  pressure was brought to bear on MUP by the University of Melbourne Council,
  led by the current chair of the Australia Israel &amp; Jewish Affairs Council,
  after Meanjin ran an essay highly critical of the Executive Council of
  Australian Jewry and its unequivocal support for Israel’s incursion into Gaza
  in its last spring edition. The article was written by the Melbourne academic
  Max Kaiser, a co-founder of the Jewish Council of Australia, set up in
  opposition to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry over the Gaza
  conflict. “That’s all completely wrong,” Bebbington said. “MUP is independent,
  it makes its own decisions about its publications, and I doubt that the
  university’s council has even discussed Meanjin this year. There has certainly
  been no discussion, no communication, with them.” Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email The former Labor politician, polymath and one of the National Trust’s
  Australian Living Treasures, Barry Jones, a regular contributor to Meanjin,
  has accused the University of Melbourne of muzzling the publication’s editor.
  “[Anatolitis] has been exemplary as an editor … and I think she’s been put in
  an absolutely atrocious situation,” Jones told the Guardian. “Worst of all is
  the cone of silence that’s been imposed on her, and that’s awful. Universities
  ought to be promoting diversity, not shutting down debate. This is a very
  disturbing pattern. I’d like to think it could be reversed, but knowing the
  way universities operate these days, I doubt it will be. It’s an act of utter
  cultural vandalism on a large scale.” A spokesperson for the University of
  Melbourne said its council was not involved in the decision to close Meanjin,
  nor were any individual members of the university council involved in the
  decision. “The council was only informed after MUP had made its decision to
  close Meanjin,” the statement said. The Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance
  said the MUP board’s claim that Meanjin is closing because it has become
  financially unviable “doesn’t add up”. “The publication recently secured a $2m
  grant from Creative Australia to fund its next two years of operation,” the
  MEAA media director, Cassie Derrick, said in a statement provided to the
  Guardian. “At a time when writers and creatives are increasingly facing
  censorial voices, the frank and fearless writing Meanjin has always published
  is more important than ever.” The former MUP chief executive Louise Adler,
  director of Adelaide Writers’ Week, who along with five MUP board members
  resigned in protest in 2019, also expressed scepticism over the publisher’s
  claims the journal had become financially unsustainable. “The costs of running
  Meanjin were insignificant in the university’s budget,” she told the Guardian.
  “It is very easy to cut cultural projects – low sales, declining
  subscriptions, a lack of funding all provide the rationale philistines are
  looking for. But with every cultural institution that disappears, the
  opportunities for writers decline and the literary fabric of our nation is
  diminished.” Meanjin, which came under the governance of MUP in 2008, has been
  revered as a scholarly peer-reviewed journal since its establishment in
  Brisbane by the journalist Clem Christesen in 1940. In 1945 the publication
  relocated to Melbourne and Christesen continued to serve as its editor for
  almost three decades. It is credited for publishing myriad essays and works of
  fiction and poetry by emerging writers over the decades, as well as attracting
  the cream of Australian literary talent. Among its contributors were Patrick
  White, Randolph Stow, Frank Moorhouse and Thomas Keneally, who told the
  Guardian on Thursday that Meanjin had been with him all his life and its
  editor was a cultural asset. “It is a matter for lament that a journal of such
  repute and consistent commentary cannot be permitted to have an assured place
  amongst us,” he said. In the field of poetry, Meanjin’s lengthy list of
  contributors include Judith Wright, AD Hope, Les Murray and Sarah
  Holland-Batt. Holland-Batt told the Guardian the closure of Meanjin would come
  as an “enormous loss” to Australian literature. “It’s quite devastating,
  really. I’m shocked,” she said. “It’s become such a mainstay of Australian
  literature, and it’s a place where so many Australian writers and poets have
  had their first publications. Meanjin was always the lodestar young people
  were hoping to publish in. “All efforts should be made to save it because of
  the prestige it brings to MUP and to Melbourne University. It’s a real pearl
  of Australian literature and it’s just an incalculable loss.”
