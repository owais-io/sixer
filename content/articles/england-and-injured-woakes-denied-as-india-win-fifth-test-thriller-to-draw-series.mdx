  Left arm in a sling, face riven with agony, Chris Woakes could only look on
  helplessly from the far end. Mohammed Siraj detonated Gus Atkinson’s off-stump
  at 11.56am on Monday to seal a six-run triumph for India and end one of the
  most intense hours of Test cricket ever witnessed. A series that seemed to
  have it all saved its best for last, a mini-session of unrivalled
  gut-twisting, tortuous drama that instantly made this fifth Test an all-time
  classic. Needing 35 runs to chase down 374, four wickets in hand, England
  collapsed in a wall of Indian noise inside a packed Oval and the first
  Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy was shared with a 2-2 scoreline. It was fitting
  Siraj should land the final blow, India’s firecracker the only fast bowler to
  go the distance in a series that chewed players up and spat them out over 25
  gruelling days. England had been cruising a day earlier, centuries from Harry
  Brook and Joe Root their rocket fuel, only for Siraj to bend the script to his
  will with a stunning five-wicket haul. Woakes was the only other seamer to
  play all five, but a dislocated shoulder on day one left him a bystander. That
  was until the fall of Josh Tongue’s wicket, 17 still needed, and he walked
  down the steps to a standing ovation. Left arm hidden under his cable-knit
  sleeveless sweater, bat in the other hand, and intending to play left-handed
  if necessary, one of England’s most dependable and selfless cricketers
  answered his country’s call. But this was India’s day and the lap of honour by
  Shubman Gill and his players afterwards felt fully deserved. From the moment
  Woakes had the tourists none for two in Manchester – more than 300 runs adrift
  and 2-1 down – they fought tooth and nail to earn a deserved share of the
  spoils. When asked what he had learned from his first tour as captain, the
  soft-spoken Gill smiled and replied: “We never give up.” Woakes did not face a
  ball during his 16 minutes in the middle, albeit simply running left him in
  distress every time. Atkinson protected him in 13 balls, scampering a bye, a
  two, and single to keep it that way. One full‑blooded heave from the Surrey
  man, tipped over the rope for six by Akash Deep, gave the seemingly
  outnumbered England fans hope. When one more clean hit would have tied the
  scores, Siraj delivered. Having already turned a gloomy morning in south
  London into a sizzling psychodrama with two early strikes, he simply could not
  be denied. More than 20,000 people soon walked out of the ground into the
  midday bustle of the capital in a state of disbelief. To think the bad light
  farce on Sunday that plunged this series into its final morning was thought to
  have stopped India in their tracks, resetting Jamie Smith and England’s lower
  order after an ordeal. Not one bit of it. While Jamie Overton carved two early
  fours off Prasidh Krishna, Siraj got the 76-over ball hooping, with the
  tentative Smith tickling his third ball of the morning behind to trigger what
  became a lasting wave of English dread. Atkinson was dropped by KL Rahul at
  slip second ball – a tough one, fingers not getting quite underneath it – and
  Overton fell to Siraj via a tight lbw. Tongue had another overturned, only to
  be yorked for a 12‑ball duck by an 87mph howitzer from Krishna, who was second
  billing to Siraj, but something of a revelation during this finale in the
  absence of Jasprit Bumrah. Siraj equalled Bumrah’s record for an Indian in
  England with 23 wickets in the series and after six weeks dominated by the bat
  – 7,187 runs was a record in five Tests – he could easily have been player of
  the series. Instead, Siraj, who hit 90mph on the final morning, had to settle
  for player of the match with Gill’s celestial 754‑run tally earning him the
  top prize. There will doubtless be ups and downs ahead for Gill, who is
  learning on the job. But after calmly marshalling his country’s tightest Test
  win, and having lived up to the expectations of a No 4 spot occupied by Virat
  Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar before him, the 25-year-old has started superbly.
  Brook was England’s player of the series, which – notwithstanding that
  incredible 111 on the fourth day – felt like a touch of recency bias. Had
  England got over the line for a 3-1 win then Ben Stokes would surely have
  merited this after 303 runs, 17 wickets and two awards for player of the match
  that ended with him missing this Test for yet more soft‑tissue rehabilitation.
  As it was, he had to settle for another near-miss, his side unquestionably
  rejuvenated these past three years, but still to defeat India or Australia in
  a series. That they threatened a second 370‑plus run chase in the space of six
  weeks spoke volumes, but the bowling – heartening returns for Jofra Archer and
  Atkinson notwithstanding – remains a work in progress. For those in Australia
  who watched the final act – and interest has clearly been piqued, more so than
  by their national team’s one-sided Caribbean tour – appetites can only have
  been whetted for the Ashes. Despite falling short here, England will be a
  different proposition from the sides that have barely competed on their shores
  since the win in 2010-11. After a titanic series when players were pushed to
  the limits, verbals and moral judgments were traded and ended with a stricken
  Woakes courageously defying the pain, only for another warrior in Siraj to
  prevail, that much‑anticipated clash this winter has a lot to live up to.
