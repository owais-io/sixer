  Fears for South Australia’s annual cuttlefish gathering amid deadly algal
  bloom

  As thousands of giant cuttlefish gather in South Australia’s Spencer Gulf,
  scientists are investigating emergency actions amid fears the state’s toxic
  algal bloom could be catastrophic for the globally unique natural phenomenon.
  The spectacular annual cephalopod meet-up takes place in a kaleidoscope of
  colour off the coast of Whyalla from late May to August, attracting thousands
  of tourists from Australia and overseas. But this year scientists have sounded
  the alarm as the event – known to locals as Cuttlefest – coincides with the
  spread of deadly algae into the Spencer Gulf. Dr Zoe Doubleday, a marine
  ecologist at the University of South Australia, said the phenomenon was unique
  in that “it’s the only population of giant Australian cuttlefish – and only
  population of cuttlefish worldwide – that comes together and breeds in their
  tens of thousands and forms this spectacular natural wonder”. Doubleday said
  the short lives of the cuttlefish, and lack of generational overlap, made the
  Spencer Gulf population particularly vulnerable to the harmful bloom of
  Karenia mikimotoi algae, which has devastated marine life along the state’s
  coastline since March. Sign up: AU Breaking News email In an emergency meeting
  convened by the state government on Wednesday, scientists and marine managers
  agreed to investigate safeguards in the event of the bloom being detected in
  waters off Point Lowly, where the cuttlefish gather annually. Options included
  looking at the feasibility of collecting an insurance population of cuttlefish
  eggs, something that had never been tried before. “If it did reach the
  breeding aggregation, there’s a good chance it could just wipe all the eggs
  out,” Doubleday said. “When mum and dad die, you’ve just got the offspring
  left. If all the eggs are wiped out in the bloom – and we’ve seen how lethal
  this bloom can be – then there’s no generation … left to replenish or
  repopulate the population.” Stefan Andrews, marine scientist at the Great
  Southern Reef Foundation, said if that occurred it would be “catastrophic”.
  Thousands of giant cuttlefish, some measuring up to 50cm, had already arrived
  “right on cue” to mate and lay eggs at the national heritage-listed Cuttlefish
  Coast Sanctuary Zone – about 63km south of Port Augusta and 15km north-east of
  Whyalla – according to Andrews, who has spent hundreds of hours underwater
  observing the cuttlefish breeding events over the last 15 years. “You can have
  tens of thousands of cuttlefish all within a pretty small area,” he said.
  There’s some really fantastic egg-laying habitat there. It’s this rocky reef
  that’s got all the seaweeds over it. And they lay the eggs on the underside of
  what they call dens – little caves or rocky outcrops.” While scientists are
  holding out hope that cold water temperatures and high salinity in the upper
  Spencer Gulf would act as a buffer against the worst of the bloom, the state
  government is monitoring the situation closely and developing contingency
  plans. South Australia’s environment minister, Dr Susan Close, said “while
  early indications have not shown impacts of the algal bloom on the cuttlefish
  population, the government will continue to monitor satellite imagery and
  survey the cuttlefish coast”.
