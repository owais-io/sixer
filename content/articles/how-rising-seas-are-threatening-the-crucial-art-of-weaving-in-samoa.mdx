  In the Samoan village of Neiafu, Amio Pei Ioane sits with a group of women in
  a weaving house. Around her, rolls of stripped pandanus leaves, the
  spiky-leaved plant used to make woven mats, rest in bundles. She began weaving
  when she was 15, assisting the village group before eventually joining the
  central line of weavers working on a large ceremonial mat. Now, she is the
  matua u‘u, or elder master weaver, offering guidance and encouragement to
  others “I have done this for too long, it’s now their turn,” she says. The
  women are creating a mat for a village event, working from first light until
  just before sunset. “We take short breaks, but otherwise, this is us for the
  whole day,” says Amio. For generations, women in Samoa have harvested,
  prepared and woven intricate mats used in ceremonies and village life. The
  fine mats are the country’s most treasured cultural artefacts but now, they
  are under threat as the pandanus is starting to show signs of decline. The
  pandanus grows on the coastline, yet in Neiafu, and other low-lying parts of
  Samoa, the impacts of climate change are starting to affect the plant’s
  growth. Saltwater intrusion, prolonged drought, and accelerating coastal
  erosion are altering the ecological conditions required for healthy pandanus
  growth. These environmental changes reduce soil fertility, increase salinity
  and make it harder for pandanus to thrive in shallow coastal zones. “Climate
  change is profoundly impacting coastal communities in Samoa,” says
  conservationist Alofa Paul. “Rising sea levels and increased storm intensity
  are exacerbating these stressors, creating conditions that are increasingly
  unsuitable for pandanus cultivation. Without intervention, these impacts are
  projected to intensify in the coming years.” The women in Neiafu have noticed
  the changes. “We can see a slow shift,” says Tutogi Mua, a weaver with the
  Neiafu women’s committee. Preparing the leaves is a communal effort that
  requires time, skill, and care. The process begins with harvesting and
  de-thorning, followed by sun-drying, boiling, and further drying before the
  leaves are split into thin strips and coiled for storage. “It’s important for
  the strips to be clean cut, to maintain the integrity of the weave,” says
  Tutogi. As environmental pressures mount, cultural leaders are concerned that
  the pandanus decline could disrupt a practice central to women’s roles in
  Samoan society. “Across the Pacific, women have always held rich cultural
  knowledge, from weaving fine mats to working with traditional textiles,” says
  Alison Davidian, UN Women Representative in the Pacific. Cultural expert
  Toleafoa Solomona agrees, saying threats to pandanus are threats to women’s
  contributions to village life. Alai Tafola, who learned to weave as a
  teenager, says she hopes to pass the skill on. “We need to maintain this
  practice, and I am grateful to have learned it and want young women to
  continue it.” As the women of Neiafu wove, Maeva Moelagi, a first-year
  university student from New Zealand there to visit family, was invited to
  learn the basics from Amio, who briefly returned to weaving to teach her the
  beginning stages of the fine mat. The women paused momentarily to watch as the
  elder meticulously wove the first line of the fine mat. As she guided Maeva’s
  hands, she ensured that her skillset is passed to the next generation. For
  now, the pandanus still grows behind the village and the women still gather to
  weave, holding their culture together, despite an uncertain future for the
  craft they hold dear.
