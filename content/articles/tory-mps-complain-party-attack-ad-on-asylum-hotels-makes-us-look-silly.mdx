  Conservative MPs have expressed frustration at their party’s “piss-poor”
  messaging over hotels housing people seeking asylum. Leaked WhatsApp messages
  show members are concerned that the party’s leadership is attacking Keir
  Starmer’s government for policies introduced by the Conservatives. Kevin
  Hollinrake, the Tory chair, agreed that an advert shared by Conservative
  Campaign Headquarters last week was “of concern” but insisted it would not be
  deleted. The WhatsApp exchange, which was first reported by ConservativeHome,
  came after the Tories launched an advert featuring a “list of perks” received
  by people housed in asylum hotels. It included housing and food “provided
  directly by the state” and clothing provided by the Home Office, which are
  offered to people who arrive in the UK and claim asylum. The advert also
  included other claims that have since been challenged as exaggerations,
  including claims of discounted Spanish and French lessons, free driving
  lessons and free PlayStation consoles for new arrivals. Lewis Cocking, the MP
  for Broxbourne, wrote: “This makes us look silly as we gave them all this too
  which is why we are in the mess we are in today. Completely unacceptable –
  they should be put in detention centres and deported.” His message prompted a
  series of shadow ministers to signal their support, with the home affairs
  spokesperson, Alicia Kearns, the foreign affairs representative, Andrew
  Rosindell, and the housing spokesperson, Paul Holmes, responding with
  thumbs-up emojis. Hollinrake replied: “Agreed. Do message me directly with
  anything [sic] other ads of concern.” Ben Obese-Jecty, another 2024-intake MP,
  shared a post written by Nigel Farage, whose Reform UK party is leading the
  Conservatives in the polls by an average of about 12 points and made
  significant gains at the Tories’ expense in the local elections earlier this
  year. Farage had reposted the Tory graphic and written: “They should be in
  hiding.” Obese-Jecty wrote underneath: “As predicted.” Cocking wrote in the
  WhatsApp chain that the party’s original post should be taken down, pointing
  out that it could be weaponised against Tory MPs with asylum hotels in their
  constituencies. “Well I did say and no one seems to listen. I have an asylum
  hotel and the community is ripping itself apart and it’s okay for everyone
  that doesn’t. We did this and we must come up with a policy that solves it,”
  he wrote. Rosindell and another 2024-intake MP, Peter Bedford, liked the
  message. Hollinrake claimed it would be counterproductive to remove the post,
  although he said he had “spoken to the team about it” and accepted that the
  message should have been better framed. “It’s a fine line really, as we’re
  saying that we’d do stuff now that we didn’t do before on the basis of ‘under
  new leadership’,” Hollinrake wrote to his fellow MPs. Obese-Jecty, one of just
  26 new Tory MPs, wrote that the policies being attacked were introduced and
  maintained under Conservative governments. “Most of those perks are ridiculous
  but some of them have been in place for years and have our fingerprints all
  over them, so why are we trying to pin them on Labour who can easily point
  that out?” he asked. “Why would anyone believe we’d scrap them now unless we
  explicitly state how we would?” The MP for Huntingdon added: “I agree that the
  tweet can’t be removed, that dinghy has sailed, but it’s yet another example
  of piss-poor comms from CCHQ that cause unnecessary media embarrassment. This
  isn’t the first time it’s been raised.” A Conservative spokesperson told
  ConservativeHome: “Kemi Badenoch has been clear that under her leadership this
  is a changed Conservative party. She has set out where we failed on
  immigration and delivered bold new plans to set it right, including our
  deportation bill which would take back control of our borders. “We will
  continue to hold Labour to account for their total failure to tackle the small
  boats crisis.”
