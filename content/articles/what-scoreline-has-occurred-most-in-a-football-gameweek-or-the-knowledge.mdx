  “Seven of the nine matches in Ligue 1 last weekend finished 1-0,” notes Liam
  Togher. “That’s 78% of the games. Has there ever been a more common instance
  of one specific scoreline in a single gameweek?” This is a question that
  George Graham would love, and Chris Roe has done the hard yards to find an
  example that can beat the above though, alas, it doesn’t involve the Arsenal
  team of the late 1980s who made 1-0 scorelines famous. “I’ve considered this
  from the point of view of rounds of matches (e.g each teams Nth match in the
  season). In this case, the most common 1-0 group in English league football is
  from the 14th round of Championship matches in the 2016-17 season (21 and 22
  October 2016) when eight of the 12 matches ended with a 1-0 scoreline. “We can
  find so much more heading into Europe, and specifically to the 2012-13 Turkish
  Süper Lig. In the 29th round of matches (played between the 12th and 15th
  April 2013) there were nine matches, and eight of these ended with a 1-0
  scoreline (88.89%). The only one that got away ended with a 1-1 draw!” A
  near-miss of 1-0 perfection. Chris continues: “In my dataset I could find a
  total of 12 gameweeks from the various European leagues with higher than 78%
  being 1-0, with 10 of them being from Scottish leagues where four of the five
  matches ended 1-0. Generalising to any specific scoreline – within the data in
  my set I could find no other scoreline that occurred more times in a single
  gameweek than the 1-0 examples outlined above.” Long title droughts in capital
  cities “With Hearts now making noises about winning the Scottish Premiership,
  I notice it’s actually 65 years since this last happened (1960). With Hibs
  it’s even longer at 73 years (1952),” writes Paul White. “Is there any other
  country where a club from its capital city have failed to win its domestic
  league for so long?” Chris Blackburn gets the ball rolling on this one. “A
  team from Berlin has never won the Bundesliga in its current form, although
  that only started in 1963. Hertha BSC last won the German title in 1931, 29
  years before Hearts’ last title. Although as an answer to the above question,
  it’s further complicated by the fact that Berlin wasn’t a capital city between
  1949 and 1990. So potentially Hertha not winning their national title in 96
  years is the answer, albeit with several caveats.” Darren Jalland has this to
  add. “Obviously East Germany had many champions from East Berlin, but as Fifa
  and Uefa both regard the current German system as a continuation of the West
  German one I think we can ignore the DDR Oberliga. In fact, a team from
  Austria (Rapid Vienna in 1941, during the Anschluß) have been champions more
  recently than a side from the capital.” A meeting of (very) young minds “My
  uncle and I recently watched Will Still (32) and Fabian Hürzeler (32) do
  battle in pre-season,” notes Joe Strawson. “Both younger than me, and with a
  combined age younger than my uncle, are there examples of managers with a
  lower combined age facing each other?” You might think that any example to
  beat the above would be a modern one, with coaches seemingly getting younger.
  But nope, regular contributor Stijn winds the clock back 95 years to unearth
  this gem. “Both coaches in the 1930 World Cup final were extremely young.
  Alberto Suppici (Uruguay) was 31 years, eight months and 11 days on the day of
  the final and Juan José Tramutola (Argentina) was even younger: 27 years, nine
  months and 10 days. That makes for a combined age of approximately 59 and
  a-half year olds.” Ultimate pass master “Curtis Jones completed 53 out of 53
  passes in the Community Shield. Against Southampton in 2024 he enjoyed a 100%
  completion rate with 58 passes,” writes Gregg Bakowski. “What is the record
  number of passes completed by a player with a 100% record in a match? Surely
  someone has completed more.” They have, and by quite some margin. Here’s Tom
  Solan: “Phillip Lahm can beat Curtis Jones’ 53/53 successful passes with 134
  against Hertha Berlin, which also clinched the title for Bayern.” We’ve taken
  a deep dive into clubs with incredible statistics for completed passes in a
  match in a previous edition of a Knowledge. It’s well worth another look,
  given Lahm’s record came in a match in which Bayern completed over 1,000
  passes. Knowledge archive “Just been looking back at 1958 to see how Wales
  progressed to the quarter-final of that World Cup,” wrote Jez Orbell in July
  2016. “To say they had a sprinkling of good fortune is to put it mildly. To be
  clear this is not a bitter England fan but someone intrigued as to the most
  unlikely progression of a club or country in a competition. How many
  withdrawals, play-offs or obscure goal average advances has a team benefitted
  from and what is the furthest in the competition that they went? The ultimate
  beneficiary would have to be Denmark at Euro 1992 but what other notable
  examples are there?” “My vote goes to North Korea for their famous 1966 World
  Cup endeavours,” writes Simon Atkinson. “They qualified for the tournament
  initially as the only Asian association not to boycott the tournament (due to
  a dispute about allocation of places across the federations). African nations
  obligingly followed suit, to leave only a two-leg play-off against Oceania
  representatives Australia in, of all places, Cambodia. The Aussies didn’t
  really bother to train, and got trounced 6-1 and 3-1 for their troubles,
  opening the way for the North Koreans to embark on their journey to Ayresome
  Park and ultimately Goodison Park, where they succumbed to Portugal in the
  quarter-final having won one of their four World Cup finals games.” Ah, but it
  was a good one to win. This piece is also worth revisiting on North Korea’s
  1966 World Cup memories. Can you help? “Aldershot Town of the National League
  have lost their three opening games of the season 2-3,” writes John Morris.
  “This must be notable for the number of goals involved over the 3 games but
  what’s the longest run of games where a team has won or lost each game by an
  identical score line?” “I seem to remember reading (possibly in this column)
  that it’s some time since a Premier League gameweek passed without at least
  one English goalscorer,” begins Matt Davison. “Maybe it’s never happened.
  However there were no English scorers on the opening week of this season.
  (Some were born and have played all their football in England but play
  international football for another nation). How rare is this?” “When Reinildo
  Mandava started for Sunderland in their 3-0 win over West Ham, he became the
  first Mozambican to play in the Premier League, which has now hosted players
  from 125 different countries, stretching from the Seychelles to the Faroe
  Islands. That only dates from 1992 though - are there any nationalities that
  played in “the old First Division” (as my Mum still calls it) that haven’t yet
  been represented in the Premier League?” asks Owen Collins. Mail us with your
