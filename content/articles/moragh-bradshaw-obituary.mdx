  As a teenager, my mother, Moragh Bradshaw, who has died aged 87, asked her
  father what life was for. His answer, that it was to help others, was advice
  that had a profound impact, leading Moragh to dedicate much of her time and
  energy to social justice and the environment. Born in Rugby, Warwickshire, to
  Winifred and Kenneth Walker, an engineering lecturer, Moragh spent most of her
  early childhood separated from her parents after she and her elder sister,
  Kathrine, were evacuated to New Zealand, their mother’s homeland, during the
  second world war. After returning to Britain in 1945, she went to Sowerby
  Bridge grammar school and then studied geography at Edinburgh University,
  where she helped establish the first CND group in the city and joined the
  Society of Friends (Quakers), attracted by their belief in pacificism. In the
  1960s Moragh worked as a town planner for the London county council,
  Skelmersdale Development Corporation and the National Parks Commission. It was
  during this period that she first got very involved in volunteering,
  participating in international exchanges organised by the Quakers, spending
  weekends dredging canals and restoring the Ffestiniog narrow gauge railway in
  north Wales, which was where she met my father, Paul Bradshaw, a solicitor and
  fellow volunteer. They married in 1967 and shortly afterwards moved to
  Liverpool, where they raised four children. Moragh’s tendency to say yes when
  asked to help led to a life rich with volunteering experiences, ranging from
  helping to set up a Citizens Advice bureau in Toxteth and volunteering there
  for more than 30 years, to teaching for the National Childbirth Trust and
  chairing a housing association. She was appointed MBE in 1989 for her
  contribution to the St Helens and Knowsley Groundwork Trust’s pioneering work
  to restore former industrial land. After she and Paul moved to north Wales in
  2005, Moragh took on new commitments, including helping to organise a local
  eco fair and coordinating the volunteer stewards for Porthmadog Maritime
  Museum. Moragh will also be remembered for her needlework skills and the
  generosity with which she shared them. She studied embroidery in the 80s and
  in later life devoted much time to patchworking and quilting, not only
  creating many beautiful pieces herself, but devoting significant time to
  supporting others’ creativity, running workshops for local textile groups and
  teaching children to knit. She is survived by Paul, their children, James,
  Helen and me, and four grandsons. Her younger son, Edward, died in 2002.
