  Elon Musk’s “retro-futuristic” Tesla Diner in Hollywood has become a new
  flashpoint for the “Tesla Takedown” movement, with dozens of protesters
  picketing the diner last weekend alongside inflatable tube figures of Musk
  performing a Nazi salute. The viral popularity of the new diner, which is
  surrounded by 80 Tesla charging stations and two giant movie screens, has
  sparked out-the-door lines, massive traffic jams, and two angry protests, all
  within its first week of operation. Organizers say they are protesting against
  what they see as the Tesla CEO’s corrosive effect on US democracy, as well as
  the human cost of the sweeping government cuts he spearheaded while working
  within the Trump administration earlier this year. For months, protesters who
  oppose the billionaire’s political power have demonstrated outside of Tesla
  showrooms across the US and the world, hoping that by applying pressure to
  Tesla, a publicly-traded company, the Tesla Takedown movement can have an
  impact on Musk’s behavior. “Musk thought [the diner] would be good for him,
  but it’s actually great for anti-Tesla protesters as well, to give us
  increased visibility,” said Joel Lava, who has been organizing weekly Tesla
  Takedown protests outside a Tesla service station in Burbank, California.
  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Though Musk has
  officially left his role within the Trump administration, and has since
  publicly feuded with the president, the devastating effects of his so-called
  “department of government efficiency” (Doge) live on, Lava said. Lava cited
  recent reports that the US had thrown away nearly 500 metric tons of emergency
  food aid this spring, in the wake of Doge’s dismantling of the US Agency for
  International Development (USAID). Global health officials have also said
  Musk’s budget-cutting efforts have thrown global HIV prevention efforts,
  including the rollout of a new “miracle” drug, into chaos. There are hometown
  considerations, as well, Lava added: Musk has a history of anti-trans
  comments, and the diner is right on the border of West Hollywood, one of LA’s
  historic LGBTQ+ neighborhoods. Protesters outside the Hollywood diner last
  weekend carried signs reading “Fuck Nazi Billionaires” and “Boycott Tesla”.
  “We WILL NOT REST until the world has internalized the truth that TESLA FUNDS
  FASCISM,” organizers wrote in a post advertising the demonstrations, which one
  Los Angeles organizer estimated attracted about 100 people on Saturday, and
  about 85 on Sunday. A Los Angeles police spokesperson described the two
  demonstrations in Hollywood as “peaceful protests”. Social media video of the
  diner demonstrations showed a few apparent Musk supporters yelling at
  protesters, including one young man caught on video describing himself as “a
  proud fascist”. Dave, a Los Angeles-based Tesla Takedown organizer, said a few
  drivers of newer Teslas and Cybertrucks around the diner had screamed at the
  protesters, and “there were some people who were doing the Sieg Heil
  [salute]”. At least one Cybertruck driver had gotten out of his vehicle to
  confront protesters, Dave said. The organizer asked not to be identified by
  his full name because he feared that protesting against Musk might affect his
  employment opportunities. Other Tesla fans waiting in line outside the diner
  simply seemed confused by the political rhetoric, Dave said, and other people
  driving by the diner were audibly supportive. “We got a lot of honks and
  fist-pumps in solidarity, and many of those were even from Tesla drivers
  themselves – especially the people driving the older models of Teslas,” he
  said. Since it opened at 4.20pm last Monday, the diner has attracted Musk fans
  from across southern California, as well as curious tourists. At about midday
  on Wednesday last week, many fans in line had brought children with them, and
  some said that their kids were especially excited to see Musk’s diner, which
  they had heard about on TikTok or YouTube. One Tesla Diner customer told the
  LA Public Press on Saturday that the protesters’ comparisons of Musk to a Nazi
  did not make sense to him. “If he’s a fascist, who has he killed?” the man
  asked. “Nazis kill people, from what I understand.” Dave, the Tesla Takedown
  organizer, said the demonstrators were considering more protests outside the
  diner, but that the group has already received at least one social media
  threat that they will be assaulted if they protest again next weekend. Asked
  about those threatening social media posts, which came from an anonymous
  pro-Musk Bluesky account, an LAPD spokesperson said the department was not
  currently aware of “any specific threat”. For Angelenos who live in the
  neighborhood surrounding Musk’s new diner, its sudden popularity has sparked a
  litany of complaints. Local news outlets have reported that neighborhood
  residents have complained of the chaos and traffic it has brought to the
  neighborhood, including “insane gridlock from 1pm to 1 am”, and concerns about
  the giant movie screens blocking the view from nearby apartments. “If you can
  send people to Mars, you should be able to figure out how to make this doable
  for residents,” one resident told ABC7 News.
