  With the Trump administration’s campaign to reshape US higher education in
  full swing, some top universities have agreed to pay hundreds of millions of
  dollars to settle antisemitism claims; others may soon spend more and submit
  to major restrictions on their autonomy to avoid billions in funding cuts and
  other crippling measures. The University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University
  and Brown University have reached settlements with the government in the past
  month, seeing millions in federal funding restored in exchange for adopting
  measures that advocates warn severely undermine their independence. Columbia
  also agreed to pay more than $220m to settle antisemitism allegations,
  including an employment discrimination claim that may qualify any Jewish
  employee who has allegedly experienced antisemitism to get a payout. The
  University of California, Los Angeles, also agreed last week to pay $6m to
  settle a lawsuit by Jewish students and a professor over its handling of
  pro-Palestinian protests – but that did not stop the Trump administration from
  citing “antisemitism and bias” to freeze more than $300m of the university’s
  funding. Harvard University is reportedly considering paying as much as half a
  billion dollars to restore billions in research funds and fend off further
  attacks by the government – even though the university’s president, Alan
  Gerber, has denied the reports. The settlements come amid a flurry of cuts,
  investigations and other measures designed to curtail the independence of
  universities that the Trump administration has described as “the enemy”. Lynn
  Pasquerella, the president of the American Association of Colleges and
  Universities says they mark “a watershed moment for American higher education”
  and will “further embolden the administration to use coercive tactics against
  other institutions”. “The weaponization of federal funds in an effort to
  enforce ideological conformity through the control of campus policies, the
  curriculum, research, and discourse inside and outside of the classroom poses
  a threat to the fundamental mission of US colleges and universities,” she
  said. UPenn, Columbia and Harvard did not respond to the Guardian’s requests
  for comment. A spokesperson for Brown said the agreement with the
  administration “preserves the integrity of Brown’s academic foundation and
  enables us to move forward after a period of considerable uncertainty”. The
  White House is reportedly negotiating with several other universities. About
  60 institutions are under investigation over alleged antisemitism and several
  have had federal funding cut or threatened. Education advocates warn that with
  each settlement, more universities risk coming under attack. “When one
  university capitulates to Trump’s hostage-taking strategies it puts pressure
  on all institutions because it confirms that this strategy works,” said Isaac
  Kamola, a professor at Trinity College who studies conservative efforts to
  undermine higher education. “Every institution is now at risk.” Ripple effect
  Columbia, where pro-Palestinian students staged a 2024 protest encampment that
  was soon followed by dozens of others nationwide, was the first university to
  be targeted by the administration. When it reached a much-anticipated
  settlement after months of negotiations, the US education secretary, Linda
  McMahon, boasted that the deal would offer “a roadmap” for other universities.
  Columbia’s reforms “will ripple across the higher education sector and change
  the course of campus culture for years to come”, she said. Todd Wolfson, the
  president of the American Association of University Professors, called the
  settlement “a disaster” for “the independence of colleges and universities
  nationwide”. But he echoed McMahon’s prediction: “The settlement will only
  fuel Trump’s authoritarian appetite.” The deal sees Columbia submitting to the
  oversight of an independent monitor reporting to the government, and agreeing
  to review its Middle East curriculum and expand Israel and Jewish studies.
  That’s in addition to several measures the university had already taken,
  including the adoption of a controversial definition that conflates
  antisemitism with criticism of Israel. Notably, the agreement does not
  preclude the government from issuing more demands in the future. Columbia also
  agreed to pay $200m to the government over three years, and $21m to settle a
  class-action lawsuit that the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
  described as the “largest such settlement” in two decades. That agreement
  follows a charge brought on behalf of “all Jewish employees” at Columbia, with
  the funds intended “to remedy alleged antisemitism harassment that may have
  been experienced by its employees”, the commission said. It added that a
  claims administrator would reach out to all “potential aggrieved individuals”
  with a confidential questionnaire to determine eligibility. A spokesperson for
  the commission said that all Jewish employees were entitled to part of the
  settlement “if they experienced discrimination, harassment, and/or
  retaliation” based on their Jewish or Israeli identity, and that they do not
  need to have previously filed a complaint to be considered. “What matters is
  their experience with antisemitism at Columbia,” the spokesperson said. Some
  of Columbia’s Jewish employees questioned the criteria. “Where is my
  antisemitism money?” James Schamus, a faculty member who previously denounced
  the university’s actions “in the name of Jewish safety” wrote in a post. He
  said that he suspected the payouts would be distributed not based on
  “Jewish-ness” as much as political considerations. But it is Columbia’s
  agreement to yield to the administration on academic matters that met the
  fiercest backlash. Last week, the prominent historian Rashid Khalidi announced
  in an open letter that he would cancel a class he had planned to teach in the
  fall, citing the settlement and adoption of the IHRA definition, and accusing
  Columbia’s leaders of having turned the storied institution into “a shadow of
  its former self” and an “anti-university”. Still, Columbia’s deal with the
  administration fell short of some of the most restrictive scenarios floated
  during negotiations, and even those critical of it acknowledge the university
  found itself in a near-impossible position. “We fully appreciate that the
  alternatives to settlement would have come with their own formidable costs and
  risks,” a group of scholars from Columbia’s own Knight First Amendment
  Institute wrote in an analysis on Monday. “It would be deeply unfortunate,
  however, if Columbia’s settlement were to become a model for the rest of the
  academy.” More targets So far, that seems to be the case. A week after
  Columbia’s announcement, Brown followed, reaching a deal with the
  administration to restore frozen federal funds in exchange for adopting the
  administration’s definitions of male and female, which advocates say infringe
  transgender rights. Brown will also pay $50m to Rhode Island workforce
  development organizations as part of the deal. The university also granted the
  government access to its admissions data to ensure it is “merit-based”. UPenn
  made similar concessions when it became the first university to settle in
  early July. Harvard has been the only university to fight back, suing over
  $2.6bn in funding cuts and the revocation of its eligibility to host
  international students. Both cases are proceeding in court, where the
  university has notched some early victories, even though Harvard is also
  negotiating with the administration and has passed measures pre-empting some
  of its demands. At UCLA, part of the largest public university system in the
  US, administrators also tried to anticipate the administration by issuing a
  flurry of new policies. They restricted the ability to protest on campus and
  centralized faculty hiring. A spokesperson for UCLA referred the Guardian to a
  statement by the university’s chancellor, Julio Frenk, in which he listed a
  host of measures it had taken to combat antisemitism. But that wasn’t enough
  to keep UCLA from becoming Trump’s latest target. “Unsurprisingly, the
  anticipatory obedience of UCLA administrators has not prevented Trump
  administration attacks,” the UCLA Faculty Association wrote in a statement.
  “Each university that falters legitimates the Trump administration’s attacks
  on all of our institutions of higher education and we must stand up now. To
  protect our democracy we must protect our universities.” • This article was

  Colleges and Universities as an earlier version stated.
