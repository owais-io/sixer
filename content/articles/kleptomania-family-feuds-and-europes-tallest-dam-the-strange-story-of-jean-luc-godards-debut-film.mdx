  When Jean-Luc Godard’s debut feature, Breathless, exploded on to cinema
  screens in 1960, it was heralded as an instant classic. However, his
  directorial career did not start with Breathless, but rather five years
  earlier with Operation Concrete, a remarkable documentary with an even more
  poignant backstory. In 1953, when Godard’s mother, Odile, sent him to work as
  a labourer on the construction of the Grande Dixence dam in the canton of
  Valais, Switzerland, it represented a desperate last throw of the dice for her
  wayward 22-year-old kleptomaniac son. Godard had returned to Switzerland to
  avoid being drafted into the Indochina war, but quickly found himself in
  trouble again. “He had this long period of repeated adolescent bad behaviour
  that his family had indulged but which eventually got him thrown in jail in
  Switzerland,” says Prof Ginette Vincendeau, co-editor of The French New Wave.
  Uncertain whether he needed to be punished or cured, his father had placed him
  in a psychiatric clinic. Thanks to his mother’s intervention he was freed to
  work on something like a military camp in a remote south-west corner of
  Switzerland, on what would become Europe’s tallest dam. The potential for a
  documentary about this epic construction project crystallised as Godard began
  working his punishing shifts. The highly publicised example of the Hoover dam,
  which helped lift the US out of the Great Depression, had set in train a wave
  of similarly monumental postwar projects in Europe. Godard’s film, Operation
  Concrete, would (as with so much of his later work) give an American story a
  European flavour. After a year in purgatory, Godard used family connections to
  move to an office job, borrow a camera and attract the attention of
  management. The aim was to make a spectacular promotional film that could also
  be sold to television. In disgrace, Godard was finally seizing his
  opportunity. All you needed to make a film was a glacier and the world’s
  largest gravity dam. On the face of it, Operation Concrete belongs to a genre
  of celebratory industrial cinema, a cinema that sought to fuse technological
  and aesthetic ambition. “Documentation of a major construction or engineering
  enterprise is a recurring genre within industrial film,” says Patrick Russell,
  senior curator of nonfiction at the British Film Institute. “Although mainly
  peopled by highly talented specialists, industrial film-making has also
  provided a training ground for film-makers such as Robert Altman, Lindsay
  Anderson and even Christopher Nolan.” Conditions were extremely tough. The
  film relays how construction had to be done against the clock; for most of the
  year the weather was too cold for the concrete to set. Bursts of building had
  to be squeezed into short summer months. This elongated process also made for
  a peculiar project: Operation Concrete would be finished and in circulation
  six years before the dam was finally completed in 1961. Operation Concrete is
  also a film that could only have been made in the early-mid century. Its
  excited ambience belongs to the world of Unité d’Habitation designed by Le
  Corbusier – another giant Franco-Swiss figure. This was a time when concrete
  was still imbued with “good” qualities, when it was celebrated as a material
  for realising visionary architectural ambitions. There is a stark shift in
  tone between Operation Concrete and Godard’s portrait of Paris’s dismal
  concrete suburbs in Two or Three Things I Know About Her in 1967, 12 years
  later. Operation Concrete belongs to a time before the advent of “the concrete
  jungle”. Visually, the film borrows from the kind of propaganda films that
  Godard watched as a young man in the arthouse cinemas of Lausanne: the works
  of Eisenstein, Turin, Dziga Vertov. Rather than beginning with a factual
  frame, Godard’s film shoves its exposition in the middle and then surrounds it
  with intense and occasionally near-delirious sequences of imagery. There’s no
  aversion to the poetic taking precedence over the objective. “We can already
  see in the film some of what set Godard apart,” says Prof Brian Jacobson, an
  expert on French industrial film and author of The Cinema of Extractions. “He
  finds the machines that move and the men taking daring action, and he moves
  his camera to emphasise shifts in scale, and to inject dynamism into the more
  mundane parts of the work.” With hindsight, it’s possible to perceive elements
  of Godard’s mature style in embryo. As well as jump-cuts, contrapuntal audio
  and a cast of proto Jean-Paul Belmondos, Godard seems to conceptualise the
  construction site as working something like an enormous film shoot. But the
  self-consciousness and the Soviet envy are tempered by Godard’s distinctive
  voiceover, a disarmingly sincere pean to the fact of the dam’s construction.
  There is evidence of some reflection here; like a kind of diarist, Godard was
  recording the different roles he had played in the dam’s construction, from
  labourer to telephone operator. Perhaps there was also some sort of
  redemption. The immediate psychological context that informed the film’s
  production was even more important. In May 1954, Odile died in a scooter
  accident. When the call came through to the dam, Godard was reportedly working
  as an operator on the telephone. Estranged from his family, Godard was banned
  from the funeral on account of his history of stealing from friends, relatives
  and former employers. He wrote the outline of Operation Concrete with
  Jean-Pierre Laubscher, his mother’s much younger lover, then worked at nights
  and weekends after Odile’s death to complete the film by the end of 1954. With
  the money he was paid for this out-of-hours project, Godard was able to quit
  his job, return to Geneva, and begin working on a new short : A Flirtatious
  Woman, based on a Maupassant short story. While he would never make another
  formal documentary, his subsequent works often drew heavily on the traditions
  of photojournalism, made use of “real people” as actors, and freely sucked
  source material from the news media into his scripts. In making a film about
  the building of a dam, Godard had drawn a line in his life and career. From
  exile in the mountains, he returned to the city as an independent film-maker.
  The idea of recuperating in the fresh Swiss air is an old one, but in Valais,
  Godard really did catch his breath.
