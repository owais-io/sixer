  don’t expect a map

  Here is poetry in the form of a game description. Bernband is “a sci-fi
  exploration game for people who like to wander…”. Players will be able to
  simply walk around a colourful and unusual world, wandering in the glow cast
  by streetlights and ducking beneath zigzagging overhead flags. They’ll tour
  hallways where strange green life grows politely in planters, and they’ll even
  get the chance to snooze on rattling otherworldly subway trains while hand
  grips – tentacle grips? – jiggle as they hang overhead. “There’s no goal but
  to stroll,” the game’s Steam page promises. “Where will your feet take you?”
  There’s something intoxicating about a game that just lets you wander. But it
  doesn’t mean the game itself is easy to make, of course. “Wandering [as] the
  main goal is quite difficult for many reasons,” says Tom van den Boogaart, the
  developer of Bernband, who is using the project to reimagine a much smaller
  version he made in 2014. “To let players explore on their own, I think you
  first of all need to give them some context, such as where they are and what
  kind of world they are exploring.” As a result, every wander through Bernband
  begins in the same way: in a small apartment with a window that offers a
  glimpse of the strange universe the game inhabits. “The idea is to communicate
  that you are someone who’s living in this city,” Van den Boogaart says. “And
  that over time it will start to feel familiar. It’s clear that your journey
  starts when you walk out of there through the door.” The apartment also serves
  as a place that players can return to after exploring the city. “It creates
  the minor goal of, ‘can I find my way back to my apartment?’. Perhaps even if
  it’s just something subconscious.” Van den Boogart quickly learned that a
  wandering game also needs to give players a number of places to head for at
  any time. As a result, most of the world of Bernband is set up in a nonlinear
  manner. “Most of the time there are multiple ways to reach a location,” he
  says, “of which some are a bit more hidden or obscure than others. When
  exploration is the main goal of the game, you want to give players the choice
  of what to explore. Even if it’s as simple as going left or right at a
  crossing.” With a design this unobtrusive, Van den Boogaart admits it’s been a
  constant battle not to gamify things a little, whether that’s adding a map
  that shows players places they’ve already been to or a checklist for them to
  complete as they walk. He has resisted, however. “I believe that having access
  to information like this takes away the magical feeling of stumbling upon a
  secret area,” he laughs. “You would already in some way know that it exists.”
  Bernband’s alien city is not a traditional open world, but instead consists of
  discrete areas that are linked by elevators and other transportation methods.
  The approach was chosen to allow players to focus completely on specific parts
  of a bigger place, all of which turn out to have their own personalities and
  flavours. In turn, Van den Boogaart works from a list of locations that he
  thinks would be fun or interesting. To keep himself creative, he ensures this
  list is fairly vague: big supermarket, shady bar, swimming pool with water
  slide. And while it’s an alien world, Bernband is inspired by places that Van
  den Boogaart knows in real life, whether that’s his home town of Gouda in the
  Netherlands or the places the games industry tends to orbit,such as Tokyo, San
  Francisco and Stockholm. “When making a game, I prefer to draw inspiration
  from personal memories and experiences instead of other media such as games or
  film,” he says. “It helps me to build a deeper and more personal connection
  with my work, and I hope that in the end this also gives the game and the
  world a unique feel.” • Bernband is in development for PC, release date not
  yet confirmed
