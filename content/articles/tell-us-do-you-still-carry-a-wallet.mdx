  Fewer than half of British people now carry a wallet, even though 80% admit
  they still own one, according to a new survey. Even though some people have a
  wallet or purse, many have moved to using digital wallets on their phones or
  smartwatches, using methods such as Apple Pay or Google Pay as their default
  way to make payments. We want to find out more about whether people still
  carry wallets and why. What do you carry inside yours? Do you prefer a
  physical wallet to a digital one? If you no longer use a wallet, why not and
  when did you stop using one? If you’re having trouble using the form click
  here. Read terms of service here and privacy policy here.
