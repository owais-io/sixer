  ‘TikTok is like an old-school variety show’: what’s behind the surprising boom
  in ventriloquism?

  It is the greatest duet, performed solo. Ventriloquism acts became a popular
  entertainment in the 18th century and have flickered in and out of favour ever
  since, with a particular heyday on TV in the 1970s and 80s. Now a new
  generation of performers are reimagining the practice of “throwing your voice”
  to a puppet or dummy – and they are doing so not just in cabaret and comedy
  clubs but also on social media feeds. The art form has such a rich history
  that its modern-day practitioners can be “perceived as just doing an old
  thing”, says 25-year-old Max Fulham, who is in Edinburgh with his debut fringe
  show, Full of Ham. Fulham fell in love with ventriloquism when he was nine,
  absorbing everything he could find about the craft online. “I watched really
  old-school stuff like Ray Alan, Arthur Worsley and Terri Rogers … I have a
  massive appreciation for them.” Despite learning his trade with conventional
  puppets, Fulham now uses more unusual tricks in his act. “I think what a lot
  of ventriloquists are doing now is trying to modernise,” he says. In Full of
  Ham, this means audiences will be treated to sketch comedy, ventriloquism with
  objects, and some ventriloquism without anything that resembles a puppet at
  all. “It is very stripped back. That’s why it feels fresh,” Fulham says. “The
  stuff without puppets feels like a new path,” he continues. In the show,
  Fulham uses his voice to become characters that exist only in “the audience’s
  imagination” while being “an extension” of himself. “It has been a lot of fun
  to play with … it is the first time I’ve felt I’ve been truly alone on stage.”
  Fulham is not the only ventriloquist trying to push boundaries. The Australian
  David Salter, who performs the show An Evening With Dame Granny Smith, uses an
  apple as his puppet. “The idea is that I’m having an interview with
  Australia’s most famous apple of screen and stage,” he says. All he has to do
  to prepare his onstage companion is bite a face into the fruit “and leave it
  in the fridge for a couple of days”, he says. “It is that simple. But there’s
  something very whimsical about a puppet that sets out a childlike
  imagination.” Salter learned this firsthand. He began his career performing
  with a sock puppet at children’s parties, before branching out into work for
  older audiences. He cites his early inspirations as Nina Conti and fellow
  Australian Shari Lewis. While the content of his shows has shifted
  dramatically, one thing has remained constant. With ventriloquism, the
  audience are “having a shared hallucination”, he says. “You have to leave your
  sense of disbelief at the door.” Believing in the puppet is essential for
  performers, too. Lachlan Werner’s first show, 2023’s Voices of Evil, was
  created for his witch puppet, Brew, which he had saved up for weeks to buy
  from a toy shop in Worcester when he was seven. “We’re like old friends,” he
  says. “I will talk to her off stage, and before a gig I’ll be like, ‘Are you
  ready?’” For Werner, this relationship makes his performance. “It feels
  different to being on stage with someone else, but I do feel as if I always
  have backup,” he says, specifically mentioning the moments his puppet has
  “saved him” from a flop. “There is a strange thing where, if I think I’m not
  going to be funny today, I can look at Brew and she seems to say, ‘I’m good,
  we’ll be OK.’” The relationship between performer and puppet has always been
  central to ventriloquism’s odd allure. At the peak of his career, the now
  80-year-old Roger De Courcey appeared on the 1976 Royal Variety Performance
  and made regular TV appearances with his sidekick, the growly teddy Nookie
  Bear. “You always feel there are two of you. You must believe in the bear,” he
  says. De Courcey came up during ventriloquism’s golden age, when it dominated
  variety shows, primetime TV and children’s programming. He credits his success
  to strong comic timing. “I was lucky because I was funny,” he says. “You’ve
  got to be able to think on your feet, just like a comic.” What drew him to
  ventriloquism was the licence it offered. “As a ‘vent’, you have a freedom
  because you can say what you want. It’s not you, it’s that little fellow
  sitting on your knee.” A puppet can get away with saying what a person can’t.
  The art form still thrives on provocation. In Werner’s new show, WonderTwunk,
  he performs alongside a “really horrible puppet” that is nearly lifesize.
  “He’s like the villain of the piece, just a really icky character – the only
  puppet I have that I don’t like to be around.” For Werner, as with many
  ventriloquists, the key lies in building a full, believable persona. But which
  comes first: the puppet or its personality? For Fulham, the puppet he has used
  most over the years – Grandad – is rooted in old ventriloquist tropes. “I’m
  fully aware that a lot of ventriloquists in the past, and still now, will have
  an old man character,” he says. “It is sort of the archetypal puppet.” One of
  Werner’s most recent creations came from a “horrid boss character” he used to
  portray at gigs. “I was playing him with my own body and voice, and then
  wanted him in the show,” Werner says. Now, a version of him is in WonderTwunk
  too: a full-sized dad character, designed by puppeteer and prop-maker Freddie
  Hayes. “He’s a puppet that feels like he’s been grown out of me … he’s like a
  mix of Donald Trump, Cruella de Vil and Liza Minnelli,” says Werner. The
  performer known as Steph Ventriloquist, meanwhile, specifically ordered and
  designed one of her puppets, Kaylee, to be a parody of the Kardashians. “I
  knew exactly what her voice was going to be before I even got her,” she says.
  No matter how surreal the act, things ultimately always come back to the
  performer and their hand. Good technique matters – even though De Courcey
  insists throughout our conversation that he “got away with” not having much of
  it. Still, most ventriloquists will have spent hours in front of the mirror,
  learning to keep their lips perfectly still. Steph first picked up a puppet
  during lockdown, and dedicated months to mastering the subtle arts of mouth
  control and hand movement. “I had all this time on my hands, so I thought,
  ‘OK, let’s learn how to do this,’” she says. It took her around nine months to
  “get good”, she estimates, and she talks me through the fine details that made
  the difference: keeping the jaw relaxed, placing the tongue precisely, knowing
  which letters are most challenging. “I spent more hours than I’d like to admit
  looking at myself. You have to, so you can see which words work.” Such
  precision is more important than ever in the age of social media, where tight
  camera angles leave no margin for error. Steph now has more than 22,000
  followers on TikTok, where she regularly posts clips with her puppets. “You
  see quite a few ventriloquists on TikTok,” she says. “And I think those videos
  are making people stop and go: ‘OK, that’s actually quite cool.’” Fulham
  believes ventriloquism’s growing visibility online is key to its resurgence.
  “It has a bit of a visual hook that stops people scrolling,” he says. “It’s
  probably something most people haven’t seen before.” The short-form content
  mirrors the quick bursts of performance that audiences would see from
  ventriloquists on old variety show bills, too. “A ventriloquist would do,
  like, one minute of something on a TV show – that was all the time they had,”
  says Werner. “TikTok feels like that very old-school variety thing, where you
  see a tiny gimmick and then they go off again.” Salter is confident that
  anyone who puts their mind to it can become a ventriloquist. When he began, he
  took out a book from the library and binge-watched YouTube videos. “If you
  watch the best people do it, you’ll really get a sense for the craft,” he
  says. “But you have to really love it, because it does take a lot of time and
  effort.” For those who do put in the hours, the reward is a kind of magic: the
  ability to bring a character to life with only your hands, your voice and a
  great deal of imagination. “It is a wonderful thing,” says De Courcey. “With
  Nookie Bear, I could tell anyone to fuck off and it didn’t matter.” Will the
  art ever regain the heights of De Courcey’s television heyday? Fulham isn’t so
  sure. “Things have moved to the internet now,” he says. “There isn’t that same
  culture of late-night TV any more.” Salter thinks it is a possibility: “It is
  still a niche act. But look what happened with Drag Race … the underground can
  just pop on to TV and become mainstream.” Whatever happens next, it is clear
  that a whole new generation of ventriloquists have begun to find their voices.
