  In a giant TV studio somewhere in Japan, a retired baseball player and a
  former rugby star are 40 minutes into a competition to see who can do the most
  sit-ups. Lying with their feet hooked to the top of a steep, bright-pink slide
  that has long since become a river of sweat, they must respond to a buzzer
  every five seconds by hauling themselves up using just their abs and hitting a
  button with their foreheads. They’ve both done that more than 500 times – when
  someone eventually misses a rep, their feet detach and down they go. If this
  were Squid Game, the slide would end with a lethal drop. But instead it’s
  Final Draft, a wholesome and emotional Japanese reality contest for
  ex-sportspeople, so all that’s at risk is the right to remain in the
  competition. As a long sequence of incredibly gruelling elimination showdowns
  whittles 25 contestants down to the one who will win 30m yen (about £150,000),
  Squid Game is an influence, but so are Gladiators and Ninja Warrior, as well
  as modern Netflix sports fests like Physical: 100 and Ultimate Beastmaster.
  Mature British viewers might think of 1970s BBC stalwart Superstars, the
  multi-event contest between athletes from different disciplines that briefly
  threatened to turn parallel bar dips into the UK’s national sport. Watching
  from outside Japan, the barrier to entry is that, unless you’re so keen on
  water polo, kabaddi, American football or ultimate Frisbee that you watch
  those sports’ Japanese domestic leagues, you will have heard of very few of
  the contestants. Perhaps Japanese viewers won’t be that familiar with them
  either, since the lineup mixes champions with those who never quite made it.
  So who cares which of these ripped strangers will be the best at running up a
  mountain or traversing a monkey bar course? The endeavours in Final Draft are
  long grinds but the contestants are a happy, humble bunch and, watching them
  in adversity, we get to know and like them. Emerging personalities include
  gentle-natured bodybuilder Kenta Tsukamoto, and Hozumi Hasegawa, a wise, wiry
  boxer with three world-title belts. Olympic wrestler Eri Tosaka’s
  determination and cunning makes her the most likely of the female contestants
  to defy the odds in a contest that has a few too many events based on pure
  physical strength. The star, though, is retired baseball hitter Yoshio Itoi,
  who looks less like a sportsman and more like the singer in a revered art-pop
  band– with his high cheekbones, debonair grin and the sort of floppy hair most
  43-year-olds don’t have the looks to get away with. Yet he soon proves to be
  fearsomely strong. Think Bryan Ferry on creatine, or Brett Anderson if he
  could deadlift a speaker stack. Final Draft needs alluring characters like
  Itoi-san, because there is a lot of time to fill. The season runs to an
  endurance-sapping six episodes, or enough time to perform 3,240 sit-ups: the
  events last for ever, and then in between the epic bouts of grunting and
  grappling, there’s a lot of chat. The post-exertion interviews tend towards
  the bland, earnest and obvious: “I was surprised,” people say after something
  happens that is to some extent unexpected. “I was happy,” they report when an
  event goes well. The 10-second skip button is your friend as every eliminated
  contestant gives more or less the same speech about how much they respect
  their conquerors. To try to keep us entertained, the show employs every
  reality-contest trick it can think of, from splitting the gang into two groups
  with either luxury or basic accommodation, to allowing tearful video calls
  with proud loved ones back home. Eventually, it all leads us to what the show
  is really about, which is the quiet tragedy of the sportsperson whose career
  is over. Having had to stop doing the thing they loved due to age, injury or
  just not being good enough, none of these people have known what to do with
  their 30s and 40s, and have ended up running fledgling businesses that provide
  paltry incomes, or working low-level jobs with bosses who are younger than
  them. Over dinner, or in the panting aftermath of another painful stamina
  test, they bond over the sadness of dead dreams and regrets that their glory
  days weren’t greater. That prize money would fund a precious new start. So it
  does matter whether or not a guy with a sprained ankle can push a giant
  medicine ball up a slope, and the finale – a three-way tug of war, each
  labouring to drag themselves to victory, inch by agonising inch – is gripping
  despite being a much longer scene of grimacing sports personalities trying to
  pull each other over with ropes than you ever thought you could tolerate.
  Stick with Final Draft and your hard work is, eventually, rewarded. • Final
