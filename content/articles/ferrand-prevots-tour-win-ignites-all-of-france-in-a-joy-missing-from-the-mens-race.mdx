  It took a long time to find a copy of L’Équipe on Monday morning. France’s
  flagship daily sports newspaper, emblazoned with an image of a yellow-clad
  Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, arms outstretched and triumphant, with the banner
  headline Geante, had almost sold out. Ferrand-Prévot, the first French rider
  to win the Tour de France Femmes, has become a national icon almost overnight.
  After her Paris 2024 gold medal performance in mountain biking and the
  Paris‑Roubaix win this spring, Ferrand-Prévot fever has taken over. Cycling’s
  slumbering giant has finally awoken. As a little girl, Ferrand-Prévot asked
  her mother why it was that she couldn’t race in the Tour de France. “But it’s
  a men’s race,” came the response. “I wish I was a boy,” the nine-year-old
  Pauline said. The French have waited a long time to see one of their own in
  the yellow jersey – 36 years in women’s racing and 40 in men’s – and endured
  decades of humiliation plus an ingrained sense of inferiority, usually to
  multiple foreign champions, some of them doped. During that time, there have
  been other misfiring women’s tours of France, but none of them compare with
  the significance and scale of the modern Tour de France Femmes, which
  Christian Prudhomme, race director of the men’s Tour and initially sceptical
  of the women’s race, now sees as equal in stature. For archivists, the last
  French rider in yellow was Jeannie Longo, who won the Tour de France Féminin
  in 1989, although that race did not compare with the investment, difficulty
  and global importance of the modern Tour Femmes. Justifiably, Ferrand-Prévot
  has been depicted as the successor to Bernard Hinault, the last French winner
  of the men’s Tour. The celebratory televised phone call from President Macron,
  within minutes of her victory in Châtel, is evidence of that. Ferrand-Prévot’s
  Olympic gold came while she was sponsored by Ineos Grenadiers, but their
  reluctance to invest further in women’s racing led to her off‑season move to
  the Visma Lease-a-bike team, and a vow to win the Tour within three years. Jim
  Ratcliffe’s loss has become the Dutch sponsor’s gain. For the French, this was
  equivalent to England men’s long‑awaited home Ashes win in 2005, or Andy
  Murray’s breakthrough British Wimbledon victory in 2013. The 33-year-old may
  well have uncorked fresh ambition within the host nation, and not just in
  women’s racing. Compare Tadej Pogacar’s muted celebrations after winning his
  fourth Tour de France a week ago in Paris with the party vibe in Châtel late
  on Sunday evening and the differences between the men’s and women’s Tour are
  far greater than just of gender. In stark contrast, there is an openness, joy
  and freedom of expression to the Tour de France Femmes that puts the monastic
  and secretive world of its occasionally lumbering male counterpart to shame.
  Ferrand-Prévot came to the Tour Femmes parchment thin, compared to the rider
  who powered to victory over the cobbles of Paris-Roubaix in April. The
  dramatic weight loss enhanced her power-to-weight ratio, but it doesn’t look
  good and she has readily acknowledged it. “I don’t want to stay like this,
  because I know it’s not 100% healthy,” she said on Sunday evening, “but we
  also had a good plan with the nutritionist in the team and everything is in
  control. I didn’t do anything extreme, and I still had power left after nine
  days of racing. It’s a tricky subject, because you have to find the limit. I
  also know that I can’t stay like this forever. It’s the choice I made.” The
  already lean Demi Vollering, second overall in Châtel, an athlete who has
  openly talked about teenage mental health and menstrual cycles, also faced
  questions on whether she would now seek to lose weight to become more
  competitive. “I could lose weight too, but I don’t want to be extremely thin,”
  she said. “I’m proud of my weight and want to set a good example. I hope that
  in the future I can win again and show girls that you don’t have to be super
  skinny, but that you can also win with hard work and power. “I know that many
  others struggle with this, so I hope that young girls don’t think they have to
  be super skinny to ride in the mountains.” Kasia Niewiadoma, the outgoing
  champion, highlighted the fast-track development in ability within the women’s
  peloton and said that her own level was “definitely higher” than that of a
  year ago. “This is the growth of women’s cycling,” she said after finishing
  third. “I think that the teams are stronger. You can see that a lot of teams
  have grown in depth – they have really strong riders who can help their
  leaders.” Of course, the Tour Femmes is not perfect. As the pressure to
  perform grows along with the rewards, it will inevitably develop some of the
  same ethical issues that confront men’s racing. But, right now it is
  refreshing, joyous, dramatic and exciting, with a growing roster of
  accomplished athletes. “Watch The Femmes” say the caps tossed to the crowds
  from the publicity caravan. “We don’t need the men any more to exist,” the
  race director Marion Rousse said earlier this summer after announcing the move
  to stand‑alone dates for the Femmes in 2026. Rousse is right. Maybe we have
  been watching the wrong race all along.
