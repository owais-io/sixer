  This was a good week to bury bad news. But why bury good news? No banner
  headline announced that the Prince of Wales is to move house. He is to go from
  Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Home Park to the nearby Forest Lodge. That was not
  the real news. “Sources” said the switch was the outcome of Prince William’s
  “brutal” past year, in which both his wife and his father, King Charles,
  received treatment for cancer. This had led him to ponder the future of the
  monarchy, no less. He means to “reshape the institution he will lead … to be
  fit for purpose in the modern era”. The move to what William intends to be his
  family’s forever home is apparently symbolic of that reshaping. Above all, it
  is goodbye, Buckingham Palace. Charles’s current refusal to move his residence
  there from Clarence House is to be permanent. William’s eight-bedroom Forest
  Lodge is actually smaller than the couple’s country retreat of Anmer Hall on
  the Sandringham estate. It has a handsome interior but, valued at £16m, it is
  no grander than an average Kensington mansion. More to the point, the house is
  to be exceptionally private, within and without. The royal family will
  reportedly have no live-in staff. William apparently wants to be a normal
  father who, even as king, wants to be seen on the school run. This is the most
  drastic move out of town by a British monarch since the Hanoverians deserted
  St James’s for Kew. William could have moved to his grandmother’s palace in
  Windsor Castle. He chose not to. He will also have his dissolute uncle, Prince
  Andrew, occupying the much larger 31-room mansion at Royal Lodge just down the
  road. He is clearly determined to join the modest ranks of the “bicycling
  monarchs” of Scandinavia and the Low Countries. In years past, there were
  intimations that the present king wanted to slim down the paraphernalia of
  monarchy. We have seen few examples of it in practice. The coronation ceremony
  was still out of the dark ages. Nonsenses such as the king’s speech, the
  changing of the guard and Maundy money stumble on. William had to dress up and
  spend a day at Royal Ascot, which he is said to hate. But there is a sense
  that Charles and Camilla are happy to conclude the Elizabethan age rather than
  initiate a new Carolean one. All the more reason to welcome a significant move
  by William. He wants to strip Britain’s monarchy of what the peerless
  commentator Walter Bagehot called its “mystical and theatrical” dignities. A
  hereditary head of state has legitimacy only insofar as the state grants its
  consent. For that to be the case nowadays, he or she should seem as normal and
  uncontroversial as seems fitting. A majority of Britons still support their
  monarchy, though only about one-third of under-25s. A bicycling monarchy is
  what it says. It implies an ordinary person doing an extraordinary job as the
  personification of a nation, not one anointed “by God” after undressing in a
  church cubicle. Dutch monarchs have cycled since the 19th century. The Dutch
  king used to be a part-time airline pilot. These royal families are not turned
  into tortured celebrities as press officers seek headlines about their “making
  a difference”. The heir to Britain’s throne might have been perfectly cast for
  the job, given the possible alternatives. But the future lies ahead. One thing
  emphatically not yet sorted is the royal estate. This rambling arrangement of
  ancient buildings, storerooms and cobwebbed attics is a relic of the British
  empire left to gather dust. What does William intend to do with Buckingham
  Palace, St James’s Palace, Kensington Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham and
  Balmoral, not to mention his father’s Clarence House and Highgrove? If France,
  Austria and Spain can forget their empires and set their palaces free, Britain
  can surely do likewise. Versailles, Hofburg and El Escorial no longer shelter
  royal uncles, aunts and cousins. Indeed, if the monarch is to be content with
  a hideaway in Windsor Park, his family had better watch out. The most his son
  George might expect is a two-bedroom semi in Clapham. As for Charlotte and
  Louis, what chance of a cosy bedsit in Stoke Newington? They would probably be
  happier that way. The clear answer is to treat these palaces as some are
  treated now, opened to the public as museums of royalty in the care of the
  Historic Royal Palaces agency. The real excitement should be Buckingham Palace
  and its gardens. The house would be a fine museum and art gallery of monarchy.
  But what of its gardens? Every royal park in London was donated to the public
  at some point in history by a monarch. Charles I gave us Hyde Park and Charles
  II St James’s. Regent’s Park was opened under William IV and Kensington
  Gardens under Queen Victoria. The Windsors have as yet given nothing.
  Buckingham Palace has the largest private garden in London. Its 16 hectares
  (39 acres) lie unused and unappreciated in the heart of town. Tearing down its
  walls and merging it with Green Park has often been mooted, but for obvious
  reasons never dared. Such a gift to London would be unequalled in Europe. It
  would also be a symbol of monarchical descent to normality. The gardens would
  complete a vale of greenery stretching across west London from Westminster to
  Notting Hill. They could be filled with bicycling monarchs. Simon Jenkins is a
