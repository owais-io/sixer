  What we learned, 19 August 2025 With that, we’re wrapping up the blog. Before
  we go, here are today’s big stories: The Western Australia government “put a
  very rosy spin” on a summary report of a project checking if pollutants from
  Woodside were damaging 50,000-year-old rock art, according to a private email
  sent by the lead scientist. The organisation behind the age assurance
  technology trial that will inform how to keep under-16s off social media has
  frozen out key stakeholders amid media leaks and resignations of two members.
  The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has cited “harrowing stories”
  in the state’s royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence and
  flagged a full response before the end of the year. One Nation senator Warwick
  Stacey, elected at the May election, is resigning for health reasons. James
  Paterson, the shadow finance minister, said the Coalition would be open to a
  contribution to a peacekeeping effort to Ukraine, a shift from a stance from
  the former opposition leader Peter Dutton who described any involvement as a
  “thought bubble by the prime minister”. Liberal MP Garth Hamilton proposed
  this morning Australia start paying migrants to go back to their home
  countries if they’re struggling to find work or a place to live. Thanks for
  your company today. We’ll be back early tomorrow. Qld supreme court rules an
  abortion is in best interests of 11-year-old pregnant girl The Queensland
  supreme court has ruled that an 11-year-old girl should be allowed to have
  abortion, deeming it “necessary” given her “physical, psychological and social
  circumstances”. In a judgment made in April and published today, Justice
  Frances Williams determined that termination of the girl’s pregnancy was in
  her best interests. The girl, referred to as C in the judgment, had what the
  court deemed “transient” understanding of the meaning of her pregnancy, and
  was described as “emotionally and psychologically immature”. As a result, she
  was determined not to be “Gillick competent”, meaning she did not fully
  understand what it meant to terminate her pregnancy and could not give consent
  for the procedure. The judgment noted: If a child is not Gillick competent to
  give consent to the termination of a pregnancy, there is a risk that the
  medical procedure may be an assault or trespass to the person and unlawful in
  the absence of a court making appropriate orders. The supreme court determined
  that an abortion was in C’s best interest. It found: The overwhelming medical
  evidence is that the risks involved in continuing C’s pregnancy are higher
  than the risks involved in termination … The evidence before the Court is that
  C has repeatedly expressed the view that she does not want to continue with
  the pregnancy. C’s mother has also expressed a clear preference for C to
  undergo a termination of her pregnancy. A motion of no confidence in the
  Tasmanian Liberal government led by Jeremy Rockliff has been defeated by 24
  votes to 10. The motion was moved by the Labor leader, Dean Winter, on the
  first day of parliament after the 19 July state election. The Greens and
  crossbenchers elected at the last poll sided with the Liberal government,
  confirming its control of the state parliament. With all parties short of the
  18 seats needed for a majority, Rockliff and Winter have spent the past month
  jockeying for support. Australia examining possible security treaty breach by
  Nauru because of $1bn China deal Australia is trying to confirm if Nauru has
  breached a security treaty after a $1bn deal signed with a Chinese company
  earlier this month. Nauru must receive Australia’s signoff on any partnership,
  arrangement or engagement with a third nation when it comes to security,
  including critical infrastructure such as banking and telecommunications.
  Under a treaty signed in December 2024, Australia would prop up Nauru’s
  banking sector, provide $100m in budget support and $40m for policing in
  exchange for an effective veto right over other security agreements. Pacific
  minister Pat Conroy said the Australian government was working with Nauru to
  determine whether a development deal with the China rural revitalisation and
  development corporation, signed on 5 August, activated treaty obligations.
  That is a really important treaty for us that helps position us as a security
  partner of choice with Nauru. – AAP More fire ants have been detected in
  central Queensland mines as authorities scramble to contain an outbreak of one
  of the world’s worst invasive species. The National Fire Ant Eradication
  program dogs sniffed out fire ant nests at five mine sites in Central
  Highlands and Isaac Council regions between 12 and 14 August. The ants were
  detected about 800km from the closest known infestation zone in central
  Queensland for the first time in history in July, with a major outbreak at a
  BHP Broadmeadow coalmine. The eradication program has issued a statement
  saying its teams are working across central Queensland to contain the outbreak
  and to determine “whether equipment or materials that can carry fire ants have
  moved from the affected mines, potentially spreading the invasive species
  further”. Delays continue on Sydney train network as peak hour begins Buses
  have been requested to supplement trains on Sydney’s airport rail line, as
  delays on some of the city’s busiest routes have continued into peak hour. In
  a statement, Sydney Trains said passengers should continue to allow extra
  travel time on T2, T3 and T8 Airport and south services after delays following
  a track fault between Town Hall and Central stations this morning: As well as
  increased service gaps, stops and departure platforms may change at short
  notice, Buses have been requested to supplement the T8 line between Central
  station and Sydney Airport’s domestic and international terminals, as well as
  between Campbelltown and Macarthur. Adani to invest $50m in Queensland
  Charmichael coalmine Multinational mining firm Adani will invest $50m in its
  central Queensland Carmichael coalmine, the company said today. The capital
  investment will increase production at the thermal coalmine by a third over
  the next four years to 16m tonnes a year. Bravus Mining and Resources chief
  operating officer, Mick Crowe, said the company had already increased
  production to more than 10m tonnes per annum over the past three years.
  Engineering studies and assessments have been completed, and work to deliver
  increased production will begin by adding more capacity to the Carmichael mine
  accommodation village. The Australian company Bravus Mining and Resources is
  part of the global Adani Group, founded and chaired by Indian magnate Gautam
  Adani. Qld police service opposes pro-Palestine march across Brisbane Story
  Bridge The Queensland police say a planned pro-Palestine march across
  Brisbane’s Story Bridge this Sunday will create security risks and disrupt
  business. A spokesperson for the police said it had suggested alternative
  routes to organisers that would minimise the risk to public safety and
  disruption to the community. It said safety concerns include that the proposed
  bridge route is not designed for pedestrian gatherings, and that serious
  disruption would occur to traffic, emergency vehicle access and local
  businesses. There is also a need to maintain essential access routes for
  community safety, the spokesperson said. The QPS respects the right to
  peacefully assemble; however, this must be balanced with the need to ensure
  public safety and minimise disruption to the broader community. While the QPS
  has concerns if the march goes over the Story Bridge, the service will always
  respect the decision of the courts. Brisbane police will have a strong
  presence on the day to ensure public safety, manage traffic and respond to any
  incidents. Liberal’s Dave Sharma criticises government’s decision to cancel
  Simcha Rothman’s visa Liberal senator Dave Sharma, a former ambassador to
  Israel, has taken issue with comments made by Katy Gallagher, this afternoon,
  about “open dialogue and discussion”. Here’s what he told the ABC: They have
  gone and cancelled the visa of a member of parliament of Israel, who sits
  within the government and Coalition. So how can you say you’re committed to
  dialogue and diplomacy and open channels when you are preventing any
  interaction from occurring? I think those two statements are at odds with one
  another. Simcha Rothman has described Palestinian children in Gaza as
  “enemies” and called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank. On Monday,
  he was denied entry into Australia before he was scheduled to join a
  “solidarity tour”. Explaining his decision, the home affairs minister Tony
  Burke said: “our government takes a hard line on people who seek to come to
  our country and spread division”: If you are coming to Australia to spread a
  message of hate and division, we don’t want you here. Under our government,
  Australia will be a country where everyone can be safe, and feel safe. Katy
  Gallagher: Australia’s relationship with Israel not broken The finance
  minister, Katy Gallagher, says Australia’s diplomatic relationship with Israel
  is “not at all” broken. Israel’s foreign minister has revoked the visas of
  Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, citing Australia’s
  “unjustified refusal” to grant visas to Israeli figures and its intention to
  recognise Palestinian statehood. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar
  said the decision was made after the Albanese government cancelled Simcha
  Rothman’s visa on Monday before his speaking tour schedule for this month.
  Gallagher told the ABC the decision was “very unfortunate” and that the
  government would “always stand for dialogue and diplomacy, particularly in
  times of conflict”. Australia has to be able to have positions on matters
  about other countries, or in this case recognition of the Palestinian state,
  and still maintain relationships with other countries. We will not agree on
  everything … It’s about open dialogue and discussion, even if there are areas
  of disagreement. It’s the way we will continue to operate across the world.
  NSW $334m regional roads fund to be scrutinised by auditor-general’s office A
  large fund for road projects will be scrutinised as more money is tipped into
  road upgrades in a region approaching a crucial byelection, AAP reports. The
  NSW government’s $334m Regional Roads Fund – some of which has not yet been
  allocated – will be examined by the state’s auditor-general’s office. It is
  assessing whether Transport for NSW designed and implemented the grants
  program in compliance with guidelines for the administration of public
  expenditure and relevant legislative requirements, focusing on grants to 19
  local councils. The roads minister, Jenny Aitchison, says it is a standard
  investigation. She told a budget estimates hearing the audit office’s interest
  stemmed from the previous government’s method of funding, which included
  allegations of pork-barrelling. One project – the Thornton Bridge duplication
  project – is near the minister’s home in the Hunter region’s Maitland
  electorate. She denies any conflict of interest. There are 20,000 or 30,000
  other people who live in that area. That road is of no material benefit to me
  or my family. Research foundation calls for alcohol law overhaul to help
  protect women and children The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education
  has called for an urgent overhaul of alcohol laws after the South Australian
  royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence found it was a
  significant factor in violence. The South Australian premier, Peter
  Malinauskas, has accepted seven of the royal commission’s 136 recommendations.
  The state government will respond to the rest of them by the end of the year.
  Several of the royal commission’s recommendations related to the sale and
  supply of alcohol. The foundation’s chief executive, Ayla Chorley, welcomed
  the recommendations: Survivors have consistently told us you cannot address
  violence towards women and children without considering the impact of alcohol
  harm – now they’ve finally been heard. Barred far-right Israeli politician
  slated to speak virtually The right-leaning Australian Jewish Association says
  it will host an online event with far-right Israeli politician, Simcha
  Rothman, saying the “Jewish community won’t bow down to Tony Burke or Penny
  Wong”. Rothman, a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, was
  scheduled to appear in person as part of a “solidarity tour” later this week
  before his visa was cancelled on Monday because of fears his visit would
  ignite tensions in the community. Rothman, a member of Netanyahu’s governing
  coalition, is a vocal critic of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine,
  and has called for Israel’s total annexation of the occupied West Bank
  territories. The AJA today said the group intended to host an online event
  with Rothman in defiance of the visa cancellation. The show will go on. The
  Jew-haters will not win … The Jewish community won’t bow down to Tony Burke or
  Penny Wong. A date has not yet been set for the online event. Marles: Israel’s
  visa decision ‘disappointing and unjustified’ The deputy prime minister,
  Richard Marles, says Israel’s decision to revoke the visas of Australian
  representatives to the Palestinian Authority is “disappointing and
  unjustified”. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar said the decision
  was made after the Albanese government’s cancellation of Simcha Rothman’s visa
  on Monday before his speaking tour, this month. The Israeli foreign minister
  said he had also instructed the embassy in Canberra to “carefully examine any
  official Australian visa application for entry to Israel”. Marles addressed
  the issue during a press conference: This is a disappointing and unjustified
  reaction to Australia and our decision around the recognition of a Palestinian
  state. This is a moment where we need to be promoting dialogue between our
  countries, and this is a very disappointing and unjustified step, which has
  been taken by Israel. Australia leading international action to protect
  humanitarian aid workers Australia has pledged tangible action to protect
  humanitarian aid workers, at a time when people who dedicate themselves to
  helping others in war are killed in record numbers. More than 380 humanitarian
  workers were killed in conflict zones in 2024, marking the deadliest year on
  record and a 31%rise from the previous year, according to Aid Worker Security
  Database statistics released on today. The foreign affairs minister, Penny
  Wong, is spearheading a pledge to protect humanitarian personnel after
  convening a ministerial group with several other nations at a United Nations
  conference in September 2024. The international development minister, Anne
  Aly, has confirmed it will be launched on the margins of the United Nations
  meeting in New York during the final week of September: The declaration will
  be an important demonstration of our collective commitment to upholding
  international humanitarian law. It will also include practical steps that will
  increase aid worker safety. – AAP Sydney commuters are being advised to allow
  for extra time before this afternoon’s peak hour, as a train track fault this
  morning has continued to cause delays on some of the city’s busiest lines. In
  a statement, Sydney Trains said urgent track repairs were finished at 11.30am
  today after a fault between Town Hall and Central stations caused trains to
  stop running on the city circle via Museum station. Trains resumed running at
  12.00pm, but passengers on the T2, T3 and T8 lines are being warned of
  knock-on delays this afternoon. Train crew were displaced by this morning’s
  incident, which also led to a temporary speed restriction on other lines. “It
  is easing as we get closer to the peak, but obviously we’re getting very close
  to the peak now,” said a spokesperson for Sydney Trains, advising commuters to
  allow plenty of time and check service updates. That’s all from me. Henry
  Belot will take over from here to guide you through the afternoon’s news. Take
  care. EV popularity prompts consideration of broader road-user charges Anthony
  Albanese and Jim Chalmers have all but confirmed an EV road user charge is in
  the works. But Guardian Australia understands the government is considering
  phasing in the charge over a number of years, and that it could start with the
  country’s small fleet of electric trucks. While the vast majority of vehicles
  on the road remain petrol- and diesel-powered, that is expected to change in
  coming decades. As combustion engines disappear, so will the revenue from the
  fuel excise – which is worth about $17bn a year and is ostensibly paid to the
  states to help them pay for road maintenance. In fact, the money just pours
  into the federal government’s coffers like any other tax. You can read more
  about the plan here: NSW treasurer says its a ‘good time’ to figure out future
  of road user charges as EVs grow in popularity Daniel Mookhey, the NSW
  treasurer, says as more electric vehicles hit the roads, “it’s a good time for
  us to be figuring out what is the future of the road user charging system”. He
  told the ABC earlier today: I think it’s fair and reasonable that everybody
  who uses our roads should be making a contribution. NSW has legislated a road
  user charge for EVs from mid-2027, starting at 2.9c per kilometre for battery
  and hydrogen fuel cell EVs, or 2.4c for a plug-in hybrid EV. Mookhey, who is
  representing the states and territories at this week’s economic reform
  roundtable, says: We do think that shows one example of how the nation could
  make some quick progress here. The NSW charge would not start if a national
  scheme is adopted beforehand. A legal challenge against a planned
  pro-Palestine protest on the Brisbane Story Bridge will be heard on Thursday.
  The Queensland Police Service is seeking to halt a march by Justice for
  Palestine Magan-djin planned for 1pm this Sunday. Brisbane magistrates court
  will hear the application at 9am. Organisers say they expect about 7,000
  people to attend. Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner says the bridge will be closed
  to traffic for the protest if the march is approved, but he says he is
  concerned about people’s safety. He says some marchers might use closed
  footpaths attached to the main deck of the bridge, which are currently closed
  for safety reasons. Schrinner says: We’re also concerned about the safety of
  the wider community as well, and the harmony of the wider community. Peaceful
  protests, they’re great, you know, it’s a right of every Australian. But there
  have been some points where it’s gone too far. And terrorist chants, waving
  around photos of terrorist leaders, [it’s] not something that contributes to a
  harmonious community. Opposition has ‘serious concerns’ amid escalating
  diplomatic row between Israel and Australia The opposition has criticised the
  Albanese government for its handling of its relationship with Israel after the
  Netanyahu government revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the
  Palestinian Authority in an escalating diplomatic row. Simcha Rothman, a
  far-right politician in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, was barred entry into
  Australia before a speaking tour this month, on the basis of his previous
  commentary and concerns it would ignite domestic tensions. In response,
  Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced Australian diplomats in the
  West Bank would have their visas revoked and the Israeli embassy in Canberra
  would now “carefully examine any official Australian visa application for
  entry to Israel”. The shadow foreign affairs minister, Michaelia Cash, today
  said the Coalition held “serious concerns” about the escalation, accusing the
  government of “deepening diplomatic rifts and undermining Australia’s standing
  on the world stage”. Cash said: The Albanese government has badly mismanaged
  this relationship at a time when careful diplomacy is more important than
  ever. Instead of maintaining trust with Israel – one of our closest democratic
  allies – Labor has recklessly inflamed tensions and undermined Australia’s
  credibility. Rothman accused the Australian government of “blatant
  antisemitism” for cancelling his visa. Consumers are the most confident
  they’ve been in 3.5 years The “long period of pessimism” in Aussie households
  is “finally coming to an end”, according to a new Westpac survey showing
  consumer confidence has reached a three-and-a-half-year high. It’s been 42
  months since Australia last registered a consumer sentiment index score above
  100 – the threshold above which optimistic survey responses outnumber
  pessimistic ones. That’s the second longest period of consistent gloom since
  the survey began in 1974, beaten only by the period around the early 1990s
  recession. As inflation and interest rates have dropped, we are now “much less
  anxious” about our finances, and even “cautiously positive” about the state of
  the economy, according to the monthly sentiment survey. The Reserve Bank’s
  third rate cut of the year – announced last week – has certainly helped, but
  Westpac reported a lift in mood across households, not just those with
  mortgages. Indeed, the biggest jump in confidence was among renters. Experts
  hope a more upbeat consumer will spend a bit more and give the economy a bit
  of a boost this year after a sluggish start. Reversing Morrison-era fee hike
  to arts degrees will require ‘significant dollars’, Clare says Education
  minister Jason Clare also pointed to the Job-ready Graduates (JRG) package,
  introduced by the Morrison government, which drastically increased prices for
  humanities degrees. He agreed the policy had been an “abject failure” because
  more people were doing arts degrees than when it was introduced to encourage
  students into other courses, but said reversing it would be a “significant
  change” with “significant dollars attached to it”. We’re taking reform one
  step at a time. Whether it’s the structure of universities or whether it’s
  fixing JRG, reform is a bit like eating an elephant – one bite at a time. I’ve
  never ruled out reform here. It’s all about what you do first. University
  governance ‘not up to scratch’, education minister says The education minister
  says you’ve been “living under a rock” if you don’t think Australia has
  challenges with university governance, after announcing reforms to strengthen
  the powers of the regulator. Asked about tearful testimony by an academic at a
  Senate inquiry into higher education last week, Jason Clare told the AFR
  higher education summit today that university governance was “not up to
  scratch”. Whether it’s the evidence of sexual assault and harassment at
  universities or in student accommodation, whether it’s evidence of wage theft
  in our universities or whether it’s the really distressing evidence that we
  witnessed last week in the Senate inquiry, all of this tells us that
  university governance is not up to scratch and that we need to fix it. ACCC to
  investigate energy retailers about concerns they are misleading customers
  Australia’s consumer regulator will investigate whether energy retailers are
  misleading customers with the way they describe and promote their plans, after
  a “designated complaint” was lodged by consumer advocacy group Choice. The
  Albanese government gave Choice, the Consumer Action Law Centre, and the
  Council of Small Business Organisations Australia the ability to make a
  “designated complaint” to the ACCC. These are effectively super complaints
  about a systemic or significant problem affecting consumers or small
  businesses, which compel the regulator to respond within 90 days. The ACCC
  said today it was satisfied that Choice’s complaint met the relevant
  conditions, with the regulator’s deputy chair, Catriona Lowe, saying: We are
  concerned that consumers may be misled or deceived by plan names or
  descriptions of plans that offer ‘savings’ that are not genuine, or that
  consumers may be discouraged from switching to cheaper plans that are
  available to them. Choice said in May it had analysed nearly 400 energy bills
  between January and March 2025, which found many retailers were reusing
  identical names for energy plans, despite offering them at different prices.
  Sydney CBD’s busiest train lines face delays because of urgent track work
  Passengers on some of Sydney’s busiest train lines face delays this afternoon,
  after an incident requiring urgent track repairs, this morning. There are
  delays across the T2 Leppington, T3 Liverpool and the city circle lines after
  an incident affecting the section between Town Hall and Central stations,
  Transport for NSW says. Trains came to a standstill earlier, although a
  spokesperson for Sydney Trains says they have since resumed. Route planner
  TripView is showing services on both T2 and T3 lines from this morning running
  more than 90 minutes late, with delays in both directions of travel. Transport
  for NSW has advised passengers to allow plenty of extra time, warning that
  departure platforms may change at short notice. Former RBA governor says
  Albanese government made him take cost-of-living blame Former Reserve Bank
  governor Philip Lowe says the Albanese government pushed the blame for the
  rising cost of living on to the RBA and “fed into” his personal unpopularity.
  Lowe oversaw 12 of the 13 interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 as the RBA
  fought inflation by increasing borrowing costs, and pushing mortgage payments
  higher just as Labor came to power. He left the bank in September 2023 when
  the government declined to extend his term. The former governor said the
  government had pushed blame on to him and the bank to avoid being punished by
  voters. It’s much easier for the political class to say ‘things need to slow,
  we’ll get our central banks to do that, and they can take the blame’. I
  remember, there was a period that I was the most unpopular person in the
  country, at least according to the media, and the government kind of fed into
  that. The central bank governor doesn’t get elected … so they can play the
  baddie. It’s much harder for the political class to play the baddie. Lowe made
  the comments when he joined a talk with the UNSW Business School’s Richard
  Holden and the e61 thinktank’s chief executive, Michael Brennan, advocating
  for a new framework to limit federal government spending ahead of the Albanese
  government’s economic reform roundtable. Lowe said the RBA’s interest rate
  policy had pushed against profligate government spending much of his career
  because governments wanted to avoid public blame for living costs. He said: We
  were exercising restraint, and the government was busily compensating people
  for the fact that things are so tough, adding to spending in the economy.
  Canavan says Nationals still considering position on net zero Nationals
  senator Matt Canavan says his party is still considering its position on net
  zero, as he helps lead a party room discussion on the climate crisis measure
  reviled by many in the Coalition. Canavan, who is hosting his own productivity
  roundtable tomorrow in parliament house about energy issues, said his party
  had been “forced” into supporting net zero under former Liberal prime minister
  Scott Morrison: He never allowed a debate the joint party room. At least now,
  with the policy being up for review, hopefully that debate will occur, and I’m
  hoping that it will be informed by some very good work that we are planning to
  commission. Canavan said it would take “a few more months to have the debate”,
  indicating there might not be an imminent timeline for a final decision – but
  with loud voices like himself, Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack opposing
  net zero, there is a direction of travel very clearly emerging for the
  Nationals. Canavan was out front of parliament spruiking his own sideline
  event, which will run tomorrow in APH. He said former treasury officials,
  former representatives of major business groups, and economists would attend.
  We asked if we should call it the “rogue roundtable” or “shadow roundtable”,
  which Canavan laughed off. With all the action from today’s summit occurring
  behind closed doors in the cabinet room, people like Canavan are looking to
  grab some attention while things are quiet. Australia’s largest biotech
  company, CSL, says it expects to avoid Donald Trump’s pharmaceutical tariffs,
  but its share prices have plummeted anyway. The company today released its
  annual report and announced a restructure, splitting out its vaccine
  production arm and sacking about 3,000 staff. Revenue for 2024-25 came in
  lower than expected, although profits beat analyst expectations, rising 14% to
  US$3.2bn on an adjusted basis. The US president has threatened tariffs and
  crackdowns on pharmaceutical imports, potentially including those from
  Australia-based CSL, but the company expects its blood plasma and other
  products should manage to get an exemption. CSL’s chief executive, Paul
  McKenzie, told investors: The plasma is sourced all in the US … [and] for many
  other parts of our portfolio, the active pharmaceutical ingredient is actually
  sourced in the US, as well. So, that would mitigate it. And for other parts of
  the organisation, we will look at our supply chain [and] where the products
  come from. But investors didn’t like the revenue undershoot or the surprise
  restructure, selling the stock and driving the share price down $33, or 12%,
  which would be one of CSL’s biggest-ever one-day falls if sustained. Victorian
  opposition leader denies shift in position on Suburban Rail Loop Victoria’s
  opposition leader, Brad Battin, has denied the party’s position on the
  Suburban Rail Loop has changed. Asked about Matthew Guy’s comments this
  morning, Battin says his position was “identical”. He went on: The government
  have a responsibility right now, they could stop the project before December,
  before the holes have been dug. But should they not do that and they dig two
  holes in the ground, the project will continue but we want to make sure that
  it is in the best interest of Victorians. Battin also added that he doubted
  tunnelling would begin on time, citing delays on other projects including the
  West Gate tunnel: Let’s wait and see what happens when it comes to the boring
  machines, and if the government can get anything [done] on time. But we know
  the chances of that are quite unlikely. Woodside CEO says company looks
  forward to ‘positive outcome’ from government on North West Shelf extension We
  reported earlier on Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill’s frustrations the company hasn’t
  been granted final federal approval for its controversial plan to extend the
  life of a major gas plant in WA. Here’s more from her remarks: O’Neill said
  timelines behind such decisions need to be considered to boost productivity.
  She said earlier: It’s frustrating that we still don’t have the final federal
  improvement approval. Time frames are certainly something that needs to be
  considered when we’re thinking about how to lift productivity in Australia. We
  know that the federal government understands how important the North West
  Shelf extension is for our communities, customers and our workforce, and
  therefore the nation and we look forward to a positive final outcome in the
  very near future. As we have previously reported, the extension is expected to
  be responsible for about 87.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year
  in the decades ahead, after the gas has been exported and burned, according to
  Woodside’s own numbers. O’Neill said this morning that Woodside recorded no
  “significant environmental impacts” during the half-year period and remained
  on track to achieve its near-term greenhouse gas emissions goals. How did the
  royal commission in South Australia come about? After four women were killed
  in a single week in South Australia, the state government set up a royal
  commission into domestic, sexual and family violence in July last year.
  Natasha Stott Despoja, former senator and ambassador for women and girls and
  founding chair of Our Watch, wrote in the foreword of the 664-page report that
  the commission received more than 380 submissions, held 48 public hearing
  sessions, more than 170 listening sessions, and consulted with hundreds more
  people. She wrote that she had heard stories that would haunt her, and that
  the report was a “call to action” for SA, which has “lost its way” on domestic
  violence. The recommendations include a national standard for responsible
  media reporting, a dedicated state ministerial portfolio, more resources for
  police, more accommodation, free healthcare for victim survivors, screening
  for non-fatal strangulation, and strategies to minimise harm to young people
  on social media from pornography, the manosphere and “incels”. Victoria
  opposition won’t stop work on Suburban Rail Loop if tunnelling starts before
  next election The Victorian opposition spokesperson for transport, Matthew
  Guy, has confirmed the Coalition won’t stop work on the Suburban Rail Loop if
  tunnelling begins before the election. Guy was opposition leader during the
  2018 and 2022 elections. At the more recent poll, he pledged to pause the
  project and invest the funding into health instead. But at an ABC forum on
  Tuesday morning, he told host Raf Epstein his position had changed: If the
  project has commenced and the tunnels are half constructed, well, we can’t
  fill them in. It will cost us more to stop a project than complete it. So the
  project will then proceed. There’s no doubt about that. We’ll have to make
  sure that it’s managed appropriately. And unlike every other major project,
  it’s managed on time and on budget, which would be rare for this government to
  have. The minister responsible for the loop, Harriet Shing, says three
  contracts totalling about $7bn have been signed and another is due soon: We’ve
  got tunnel boring machines that are arriving later this year. They will be in
  the ground and doing their work next year. Commissioner behind SA report says
  findings present ‘once-in-a-generation’ chance to address domestic violence
  Natasha Stott Despoja, the commissioner of South Australia’s royal commission,
  called the report a “a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our state to
  address the issue of domestic, family and sexual violence in a way that we
  haven’t before”. She said that task would not be easy: It will require
  leadership and I’m so pleased to hear the premier talk about the steward role
  and the governance piece that you’ve already accepted. It will require
  significant investment, reinvestment, or uplift in some things that already
  exist, but also the creation of new systems. Stott Despoja said it was a
  significant day for the state, acknowledging that the recommendations would
  take time. She said: This is not a tick and flick exercise. It’s not about
  implementing for the sake of it, it’s about getting it right. … It’s time now
  for our state to act with courage and lead with courage. And I have every
  confidence we will. Malinauskas says judicial system needs trauma-informed
  cultural change to deal with domestic violence cases Peter Malinauskas has
  also flagged changes to how the judicial system handles domestic violence
  cases: I think there’s a need for some cultural change within our judicial
  system when they contemplate how domestic violence cases are handled. The idea
  that domestic violence victims would be physically in the same environment as
  the alleged perpetrator in the lead-up to a particular case or a hearing is
  not acceptable. There are some practical recommendations around getting
  judicial officers to undergo some trauma-informed training that speaks to a
  cultural change. Malinauskas said the South Australian government intends to
  respond to all royal commission recommendations by the end of the year. The
  South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, is holding a press conference to
  release the findings of the state’s royal commission into domestic, family and
  sexual violence. The royal commission has made 136 recommendations.
  Malinauskas said the state government would consider and examine the
  recommendations before formally responding to them. But the government has
  accepted seven of the recommendations immediately. These include the creation
  of a “stand-alone ministerial portfolio” and the creation of “a stewardship
  function within government”. The government has also accepted a recommendation
  to engage with people who have lived experience of domestic, family and sexual
  violence as it continues to develop a comprehensive response to the
  commission’s report. Malinauskas said the report contained “some pretty
  harrowing stories” and that change was desperately needed in response to their
  experiences. Tragically we know one-in-four women and up to one-in-eight men
  at some point during the course of their life will experience this type of
  violence. That is wholly unacceptable in a modern liberal democracy such as
  ours, where we often espouse the virtues of the collectively held values that
  we aspire to. Early view from the economics roundtable: optimism is in the air
  We have an early view from inside the cabinet room, where the good and the
  great are discussing how to make Australia’s economy more resilient. Shiro
  Armstrong, an economics professor at the ANU’s Crawford School of Public
  Policy, said he told attendees that we should not get sucked into the rising
  protectionist trade policies and that domestic policies should be aimed at
  providing the certainty and confidence that is increasingly at a premium
  globally. Armstrong told Sky News he was impressed with the vibe in the room,
  which he described as “extremely constructive” and “very optimistic”.
  “Everyone had time to talk. Nothing was rushed. And really collegial between
  all the different interests.” A good start, at least before the roundtable
  moves on to thornier issues such as tax and regulation in the coming days.
  Woodside CEO frustrated gas plant extension still waiting for final approval
  The Woodside CEO, Meg O’Neill, says it is “frustrating” the resources giant
  has not got “final federal government approval” for its controversial plan to
  extend the life of a major gas plant in Western Australia. O’Neill spoke to
  investors and journalists in a teleconference from Sydney after Woodside
  released its half-year financial results earlier this morning, posting a 24%
  drop in profits. The underlying net profit after tax of Australia’s largest
  oil and gas producer fell to $US1.25bn (about $1.92bn in Australian dollars)
  in the six months to 30 June from $US1.63bn in the same period last year.
  Woodside has been in the spotlight after the Albanese Labor government in May
  gave the green light for an extension for the company’s North West Shelf gas
  project on the Burrup peninsula to run for an additional 40 years, from 2030
  to 2070. Guardian Australia understands Woodside and the government are yet to
  reach a consensus on the conditions required for final approval of the
  project, which include limiting the impact of air emissions levels from the
  operation of an expanded on-shore Karratha gas plant. Government to strengthen
  TEQSA, the higher education regulator The federal government will strengthen
  the powers of the higher education regulator in a bid to respond to “systemic
  risks” facing the sector. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency
  (TEQSA) has not significantly changed since it was established 15 years ago to
  regulate the quality of higher education providers. The minister for
  education, Jason Clare, said there was a “good argument that TEQSA needs
  better tools to be able to step in and act when it’s justified in the public
  interest”. In the coming weeks, the government will release a consultation
  paper on how to modernise TEQSA “to better meet the standards students, staff
  and the community expect of our universities”. Dr Mary Russell, chief
  executive officer of TEQSA, said governance failures, risks to student safety,
  questions of financial viability and the impact of new technologies pointed to
  the need for a legislative framework that “better supports TEQSA’s ability to
  respond quickly and proportionately to emerging, systemic, and acute risks”.
  The resignation of a One Nation senator from NSW is a shock, but Warwick
  Stacey’s entry into parliament was a shock in and of itself. The minor
  rightwing party, led by Pauline Hanson, wasn’t expected to gain a seat in NSW,
  giving it its equal-best result in an election. But who is Stacey? According
  to several bios (more of which you can read about here) Stacey was in the
  British army and became a troop commander with the Special Air Service
  regiment, and in Australia was a member of the Army reserve. Stacey also
  worked in the Middle East as a military consultant. Quitting soon after
  entering parliament, Stacey hasn’t given his maiden speech, but in an address
  to the Senate (which parliamentarians can do before they give their first
  speech) he called Welcome to Country ceremonies and acknowledgment of Country
  addresses the “radical left’s progressive agenda to divide Australians”. All
  four One Nation senators turned their backs in the chamber during the
  acknowledgment of country on the first sitting day of the new parliament.
  Conservation group says roundtable must protect both economy and the
  environment The economic reform summit in Canberra is hearing from the Reserve
  Bank governor, Michele Bullock, this morning, before moving on to sessions
  about “international risks, opportunities and trade”. Ahead of participating
  in the event on Tuesday, the Australian Conservation Foundation says the talks
  must boost both the economy and protection of the natural environment. Chief
  executive Kelly O’Shanassy will be present for talks on better regulation and
  approvals and will call for changes to the national environmental laws to keep
  major approval powers with the federal government. She said: Better
  coordination across federal, state and territory governments is needed, but
  the simplistic idea of handing over commonwealth responsibilities to state and
  territory governments for ‘single touch approvals’ won’t work. Among other
  contributions, O’Shanassy will call for new national environment standards, to
  define the rules on nature protection and guide project proponents on where
  they can build and where nature needs to be protected. She said an independent
  national environment protection agency is needed to administer the standards,
  “through making assessment and approval decisions, ensure compliance and
  enforcement and oversee any accredited arrangements that allow for further
  efficiencies.” O’Shanassy said: Faster decisions are crucial, as is stronger
  nature protection. Australia’s failed national nature law facilitates neither.
  The national nature law contains a series of convoluted processes with no
  defined outcomes or transparent institutions – a recipe for slow,
  unpredictable decisions and ecological and economic decline. Internet provider
  iiNet has just reported a large cyber incident after an unknown third party
  accessed its systems. The company said: iiNet has been impacted by a cyber
  incident involving unauthorised access to its order management system by an
  unknown third party. The system contains limited personal information.
  Importantly, it does not contain copies or details of customer identity
  document details (such as passport or driver’s licences), credit card or
  banking information. The company said it confirmed the incident on Saturday 16
  August and enacted its incident response plan to determine the extent of the
  breach. It said a list of email addresses and phone numbers had been hacked
  from its system, including 280,000 active iiNet email addresses, 20,000 active
  landline phone numbers, as well as some inactive email addresses and numbers.
  About 10,000 iiNet usernames, street addresses and phone numbers, as well as
  1,700 modem set-up passwords, were also taken. The company said: iiNet urges
  our customers to remain vigilant, especially to any suspicious communications
  received via email, text or phone call. If in doubt, contact iiNet directly or
  seek independent advice from trusted sources, including the Australian Cyber
  Security Centre. More details are here. Analysis reveals Australia’s largest
  gas guzzlers Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry uses 13
  times more gas than local manufacturing, according to new analysis by climate
  activist group Market Forces. The vast majority of gas used in Australia is
  directed towards LNG exports, followed by gas power plants and manufacturing,
  according to the report. Only 10 facilities – mainly those producing alumina
  and ammonia – made up more than half of manufacturing gas use. According to
  Market Forces estimates, the five largest manufacturing gas users could
  require carbon offsets up to $1.3bn over the decade if they failed to reduce
  their reliance on gas. Kyle Robertson, Market Forces’ head of research, said
  Australia’s biggest manufacturers, particularly alumina and ammonia producers,
  need to immediately step up and invest much more in the transition to
  renewable energy. Manufacturers guzzle a lot of our gas but 13 times more is
  gobbled up, turned into liquified natural gas and sent overseas. Canavan to
  convene rebel roundtable on energy prices While the government’s anointed
  luminaries are huddled in the cabinet room without their mobile phones and
  natural light, Matt Canavan plans to convene a “real” productivity roundtable
  on the grass in front of parliament house. Senator Canavan has joined fellow
  National Barnaby Joyce in calling for getting rid of the net zero target and
  replacing renewable energy with new coal plants. So it’s no surprise that the
  rebel roundtable late tomorrow morning will address what they call “the
  elephant in the room”: rising power prices. Canavan and a staffer have been
  walking the halls of parliament house this morning wearing T-shirts emblazoned
  with “Energy prices are the real productivity issue”. The AFR has reported
  that a former Productivity Commission chair, Gary Banks, will give a keynote
  speech. Other invitees reportedly include an ex-Business Council of Australia
  boss Tony Shepherd and an executive of the Housing Industry Association, Simon
  Croft. Mining giant BHP paid $4bn less in Australian tax while hiking profits
  over the year to June after iron and coal prices slid, as the company hikes
  copper production to switch towards green industry. The price BHP received for
  its steel making coal prices fell nearly 40% in 2024-25 compared to the
  previous year and energy coal prices fell 10%. The company’s coal output fell
  after it sold two mines and wet weather slowed down truck productivity. BHP’s
  annual report, out today, said Australian coal supply would likely recover but
  said Queensland’s coal royalty scheme had discouraged it from long-term
  investments in local mining, joining other miners’ criticisms. Iron production
  increased but prices fell by a fifth, with BHP predicting resilient Chinese
  and Indian demand would keep commodity markets moving but noting tariffs were
  dragging global economic growth. Together, that saw global revenue fell by
  US$4.4bn to US$51.3bn. Tax payments in Australia fell even further, as the
  company reduced its effective tax rate from 33% to 32.1%. Once you add royalty
  payments, BHP paid A$10.5bn (US$6.8bn) in tax in 2024-25, an A$4bn (US$2.7bn)
  fall from A$14.5bn (US$9.5bn) the previous year. BHP’s tax payments in Chile
  doubled to US$3.2bn as it hiked production at the world’s largest copper mine,
  Escondida. The company produced 2 Mt of copper over the year for the first
  time – less than 1% of its iron output – but it hopes to double output from
  South Australia and has more projects in the pipeline. More efficient copper
  mining helped profits rise over US$1bn to US$9bn. Copper is playing an
  increasingly important role in the business, now responsible for almost half
  of underlying earnings. The metal’s importance to green technology has driven
  up global demand and prices. Hanson describes Stacey as a ‘man of principle’
  One Nation will get to name someone as his replacement “in coming weeks”,
  Hanson’s office said, which will keep the party’s Senate numbers at four. The
  party is not yet naming that replacement. Hanson said: It is with profound
  regret that we farewell him from the Senate so soon after he was elected. I
  was delighted when it was announced Senator Stacey had won a seat representing
  NSW. I knew he would bring a wealth of knowledge, experience and expertise to
  our team along with the strong conservative values that made Australia great.
  I wish Senator Stacey all the very best with his health and his future.
  Pauline Hanson said this morning One Nation senator Warwick Stacey, elected at
  the May election, is resigning for health reasons. Stacey was elected as a
  senator for NSW and helped double One Nation’s Senate numbers from two to
  four. He said in a statement he was dealing with “personal health issues”.
  Unfortunately, I will be unable to fully dedicate myself to the role as I deal
  with my personal health issues. I don’t think a person elected to parliament
  should be anything less than completely dedicated to a role entrusted to them
  by voters, so I’m resigning to make way for someone who can do that on behalf
  of the people of NSW. Stacey was only sworn in as a senator a few weeks ago in
  the opening fortnight of parliament. Stacey confirmed his resignation in a
  phone call with Guardian Australia. Sussan Ley says all Australians should be
  ‘very sad’ about state of relationship with Israel Opposition leader Sussan
  Ley was just asked about Israel’s decision to revoke some visas for
  Australians to the Palestinian Authority. Ley said she really regrets “the way
  that the relationship between the Albanese government and the government of
  Israel is deteriorating”. She told the press in Sydney: That is something all
  Australians should be very sad about today. Israel is a liberal democracy in
  the Middle East and we should be supporting them as that liberal democracy and
  the steps that the Albanese government has taken over recent days and weeks
  certainly have not demonstrated that. This is an elected member of the Israeli
  parliament and it’s a very unusual thing to refuse a visa and I haven’t seen
  explanations from Tony Burke that actually explain what is going on here. The
  politician in question, Simcha Rothman, is a far-right member of Israel’s
  parliament. He has described Palestinian children in Gaza as “enemies” and
  called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank. Oh, the table is oval The
  roundtable – which is actually occurring around the long oval table of the
  cabinet room – today features the likes of the NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey,
  the independent MP Allegra Spender, the secretaries of key government
  departments, unions bosses Sally McManus and Michele O’Neil, business leaders
  Innes Willox and Andrew McKellar and the RBA chief, Michelle Bullock. Sitting
  on the far rounded edge of the cabinet table – as far from Albanese as would
  be possible – is the Liberal deputy leader and shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien.
  Behind closed doors, roundtable begins in earnest The economic roundtable has
  gone behind closed doors in the cabinet room, so we’re left to wait and wonder
  what’s going on in there. As we leave the boffins to their discussions, one
  person joked to us this morning that it was like a papal conclave – doors
  sealed, onlookers anticipating outside waiting for smoke signals to emerge. We
  managed to nip inside the cabinet room earlier as Albanese and Chalmers made
  their opening addresses. The prime minister said he didn’t expect the
  assembled participants to agree on every issue (with the unions, business
  groups, environment leaders and politicians in one room, it’s probably hard to
  agree on the lunch order, let alone the future economic direction of the
  country), joking that he would be shocked if they reached a settled consensus
  position on thorny topics like artificial intelligence this week. But in the
  spirit of consensus (a word you’re hearing a lot this week) Albanese invited
  all the roundtable members to drinks at the Lodge tomorrow night. We’ve been
  ushered out of the room by the PM’s media team, and while we leave the
  economic titans to their own devices, even the participants have not been left
  to their own (electronic) devices – phones, watches and other tech gear have
  had to be surrendered at the door. A few desks full of electronics were seen
  by the door of the cabinet room, held in little plastic boxes with each
  leader’s name on a sticky note. We hope there’s no mix-up on the way out, and
  that they’ve all since been turned to silent after one phone and watch started
  prominently buzzing just moments into the three-day meeting, a deafening
  ringtone interrupting Chalmers’ opening address. Liberal MP Garth Hamilton
  proposed this morning Australia start paying migrants to go back to their home
  countries if they’re struggling to find work or a place to live. Hamilton
  spoke to 2GB to tout the idea, which has been implemented in a smattering of
  other countries. He said: The reality is, a lot of migrants who are coming
  over here, they aren’t finding work, they aren’t finding the housing, they
  aren’t finding that things were as rosy as they’d hoped because of the high
  immigration policies that we’ve employed. We have to address this, we have to
  address it now. We’re not going to build our way out of this problem All of
  this is trying to give people a pathway home. This is a cost that Australia is
  already bearing, either through welfare or the high rents that we’re paying
  because of the extra demand on housing in Australia. This is a cost that we’re
  just moving from one place to another. Greens add crossbenchers in Tasmania in
  ‘powerful position’ to work with Liberal premier Woodruff added that a strong
  crossbench in Tasmania had given the Greens and others the ability to deliver
  “great legislative reforms”, saying she had had good conversations with Jeremy
  Rockliff about ways parliament could operate in a more sustainable way moving
  forward. She told RN Breakfast: I have had a commitment from Jeremy Rockliff
  that he will work in good faith and also wants to have those same mechanisms
  put in place. So it’s not our intention to do anything except to work hard for
  four years and get change for the people of Tasmania. Tasmanian Greens say
  conversations with Labor went nowhere in attempt to form minority government
  The Tasmanian Greens leader, Rosalie Woodruff, said Labor leader Dean Winter
  “refused” to make any compromises, explaining her party’s decision not to back
  another vote of no-confidence in Liberal premier Jeremy Rockliff as parliament
  returns today. Woodruff spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying she had
  been talking seriously with Labor as Winter sought to form a minority
  government with the crossbench after the state’s snap election. But she said
  her conversations with Rockliff allowed the Greens to talk about “the problems
  we’d had with him and his government over the last 11 years and the deep
  concerns that we still have about what the Liberals have been doing to the
  budget and to the environment in Tasmania.” She went on: We have had some
  sit-down, long conversations multiple times with Dean Winter and really tried
  to get some policy changes from them, some compromises really. … We were
  looking for some way forward, some changes at all. But Dean Winter and Labor
  refused to make any compromises on their policy positions before going back to
  parliament. …That wasn’t good enough. We tried really hard in good faith, but
  Dean Winter hasn’t shown any capacity or ability or intention to make any
  changes for the people who voted for us. … James Paterson, the shadow finance
  minister, said the Coalition would be open to a contribution to a peacekeeping
  effort to Ukraine, a shift from a stance from the former opposition leader
  Peter Dutton who described any involvement as a “thought bubble by the prime
  minister”. Paterson spoke to ABC News as Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy was in Washington to meet with Donald Trump: It’s very clear if
  there’s to be a durable peace, that security guarantees for Ukraine are going
  to be necessary. Now, that would have to be led by the United States and
  European partners. But if Australia is invited to play a role in, that then we
  should consider whether we can make a constructive contribution to that.
  Paterson was asked about the potential for Australian peacekeepers to be sent
  to the region in a non-combat role. He said: We are clearly not a central
  player in this conflict but we do have a very strong interest in making sure
  this isn’t just a pause in Vladimir Putin’s war that’s resumed at a later
  date. We want it to be long-lasting. So we should consider any request from
  our allies and friends in Europe as to if we can make a symbolic contribution
  towards this. Very clearly the heavy lifting would be done by Nato in this
  instance. But we are a partner of Nato and if we’re asked to make a
  contribution, we should consider it. Lone opposition member at roundtable says
  he will be constructive and critical The opposition’s sole representative at
  the economic reform roundtable, the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, lashed
  Labor for being too slow to act on falling living standards in Australia.
  Speaking before the summit began on Tuesday, O’Brien said Chalmers needs to do
  more to help households: He has set himself the biggest test since he has
  entered parliament. He has made it very clear to the Australian people that he
  will turn the stats around on living standards. Australia has experienced the
  biggest decline in living standards of all developed nations as a direct
  consequence of this government’s actions. I see my role as representing the 27
  million Australians who have been struggling under this Albanese government. I
  will, of course, be constructive where I can, and critical where I must.
  Chalmers tells attendees we need to do ‘more’ ‘better’ in call for ‘good
  ideas’ Jim Chalmers addressed attendees on the first day of the three-day
  economic reform roundtable, riffing on how well the economy is going under
  Labor: a rate cut last week, inflation down, unemployment low and real wages
  growing. But, naturally, our hyperactive treasurer is not satisfied:
  Australia’s performance, in many ways, does set us apart, but we’re not
  satisfied with that. We need to do more, and we need to do better, and we will
  do better, and that’s what this is all about. He repeats his “three days to
  inform three budgets” line, which is his new favourite, alongside old faves
  like “churn and change”. Speaking to the people in the room he said: “Now to
  make the most of this opportunity, we need your concrete ideas”. We need you
  to be specific. We need you to suggest ways to pay for them so that good ideas
  are also affordable ideas. We need you to be willing to test your ideas with
  others in the room. We need you to be able to find common ground and recognise
  that sometimes that involves compromises, because this is all about building
  consensus, and it’s all about building momentum, which means going beyond our
  own narrower sectional or commercial interests and serving the national
  economic interest. Anthony Albanese has officially opened the government’s
  economic reform roundtable in Canberra in the past few minutes. There’s about
  30 people squashed into the cabinet room for the start of the three-day
  summit, set to be overseen by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. Albanese says some
  of the proposals coming out of the summit could be considered for this year’s
  mid-year budget update, due in December, and next May’s federal budget. The
  prime minister said some of the agenda items for the summit – including AI –
  won’t be solved immediately: Even though this won’t be broadcast live,
  [because of] the nature of the cabinet room, the ideas that have been
  generated already will be the subject of the discussions. One of the things
  I’ve said is that we are focused on delivery and getting things done, but how
  things are done are also important. Albanese said the national interest should
  override sectional interest during the discussions. “My government is focused
  on looking after people on the economic journey,” he said. Some scenes from
  Canberra with the productivity roundtable about to begin The economic reform
  summit is about to begin, and while parliament house isn’t exactly abuzz,
  there is a quiet hum going through the building. With all the formal
  activities happening in private in the cabinet room and therefore off-limits
  to your humble correspondent (aside from a few selected remarks from the prime
  minister and treasurer to be broadcast on TV), we’re reduced to loitering
  around outside the ministerial wing. Sadly there no bunting, flags or
  paraphernalia for the summit that we can see – a quick wander past the cabinet
  room area earlier showed a few privacy screens and some information signs, but
  little else in the way of journalistic colour. The Nationals senator Matt
  Canavan was drinking a coffee at Aussies cafe earlier, in a black T-shirt
  emblazoned with the phrase “energy prices are the real productivity issue”. He
  joked to us that he was holding his own roundtable later today. A delivery
  rider in inner Sydney was hospitalised last night after he was allegedly
  knocked off his bike and stabbed multiple times with a screwdriver, police
  say. NSW police said the man, 24, was riding through the Sydney suburb of
  Ultimo near the CBD around 9.15pm on Monday night. On arrival, police were
  told the rider was allegedly pushed to the ground by an unknown man, who later
  walked away after the alleged assault. The 24-year-old rider was treated at
  the scene by paramedics and taken to the hospital in a serious but stable
  condition. Officers have established a crime scene and begun an investigation.
  Opposition says visa tit-for-tat reflects worst Australia-Israel relations
  since the second world war The shadow finance minister, James Paterson, told
  the ABC this morning he believes the visa episode demonstrates “Australia’s
  bilateral relationship with Israel is the worst it has ever been since the
  creation of the state of Israel”. Paterson said he was not familiar with “all”
  of the views of far-right politician Simcha Rothman, who was denied a visa
  yesterday, but said barring any visiting lawmaker was a major decision. He
  questioned the move by the government in an interview on ABC News: It is a
  very big call to block the visa of a visiting member of parliament from other
  country. My question is did Tony Burke discuss the diplomatic implications of
  that visit with the foreign minister, Penny Wong? Did he discuss it with the
  prime minister? … This is not a decision to be taken lightly and the all the
  implications should have been considered and its not clear that occurred.
  Finance minister says government disappointed, but ‘not surprised’ after
  Israel revokes visas Finance minister Katy Gallagher said the government is
  disappointed after Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to
  the Palestinian Authority overnight. Gallagher said the Labor government was
  not surprised by the move, which came after Anthony Albanese said Australia
  would recognise a Palestinian state and after the country refused a visa
  yesterday for a far-right member of Israeli parliament. But Gallagher told RN
  Breakfast the episode reflected the need for more diplomacy between Australia
  and Israel: At a time when we need more diplomacy and more dialogue between
  countries, it is a disappointing decision. We’re not surprised necessarily by
  it. We saw similar steps taken against other countries … But certainly our
  view is this is unjustified and we need more talk, more diplomacy, more
  channels in for discussion than we’ve needed before. Grim statistics on
  suicide attempts amongst younger people Young people have attempted suicide
  without any previous suicidal ideation or planning, the Australian Institute
  of Family Sudies (AIFS) has found. “[That] can understandably be a shock for
  their families and friends,” AIFS’ senior survey manager, Agatha Faulkner,
  said. Data from the institute’s Longitudinal Study of Australian Children,
  which has tracked 10,000 children since 2004, was released on Tuesday. It
  shows 38% of females studied have suicidal thoughts and behaviours, compared
  to 31% of males. About one in eight males attempt suicide without ideation or
  planning when they are 14 or 15 years old, and about one in 10 females at 16
  or 17 years old. Parental separation, financial stress, disability, depression
  and anxiety symptoms, and both being bullied and bullying others all had an
  effect. Suicide Prevention Australia’s chief executive officer, Nieves Murray,
  said: This research is a stark reminder that suicidal distress among young
  people can emerge suddenly and without warning. We must move beyond
  crisis-only responses and ensure support starts early, is consistent, and
  involves the whole community. • In Australia, the crisis support service
  Lifeline is 13 11 14. Children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact
  the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800. A no-confidence motion from Labor against
  the Tasmanian Liberal premier, Jeremy Rockliff, is set to fail when parliament
  returns one month since the state election today. Rockliff was recommissioned
  as premier but the Labor leader, Dean Winter, planned to test his numbers in
  the parliament on Tuesday with a no-confidence motion. Neither the Liberals
  (14) or Labor (10) hold the required 18 seats for a majority, and there have
  been weeks of negotiations with the Greens and independent members to gain
  their support. Winter’s motion is set to fail with the Greens (holding 5
  seats) announcing on Monday they were unable to back Winter after he refused
  to make policy concessions to the crossbench and repeatedly ruled out “doing a
  deal” with the Greens. The Greens stated their decision not to back Winter’s
  motion was not an endorsement of the Liberal government. The Liberals made
  policy concessions including a review of salmon farming and a ban on greyhound
  racing by 2029. Independent Kristie Johnston on Monday also said she was
  unable to support an “uncompromising” Labor. Fellow independent and former
  Labor leader David O’Byrne on Sunday threw his support behind Rockliff as
  premier. – with AAP Good morning, and happy Tuesday. Nick Visser here to take
  over for Martin Farrer. Let’s get into it. The shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien,
  said the Coalition would enter this week’s economic reform roundtable seeking
  ideas to “stop the spending spree” and “growing the economic pie”. O’Brien
  will be one of the over two dozen to attend the roundtable this week and told
  ABC’s 7.30 program he saw his role as listening to the ideas put forward, as
  Treasurer Jim Chalmers intended to do, rather than put any forward, but said
  those two points were what the Coalition would go in for. Repeatedly pressed
  on whether a future Coalition government would raise the GST, O’Brien did not
  answer directly. On how the Coalition would pay for the proposed $21bn
  increase in defence spending over the next five years, O’Brien said he wasn’t
  announcing policy. He said the Coalition will approach the roundtable
  constructively where it can, and critical where it must. But the prism he
  views the proposals would be very different to that of the treasurer, he said.
  When it comes to tax reform, if the government is genuinely interested in
  dealing with the Coalition on tax reform to drive more efficiency into the
  system, then we’re up for that conversation. And so, happy to have that
  conversation. O’Brien would not say where any potential savings would come
  from, but pointed to the electric vehicle fringe benefit tax exemption, which
  the Coalition promised to axe at the last election amid Treasury forecasts it
  could cost half a billion dollars per year. Jim Chalmers has declared his
  “ambitious government” is ready to meet the great economic challenges of our
  time as he urged attendees at the opening of the three-day reform round table
  to set aside factional interests and work in the national interest. In draft
  speaking notes provided to Guardian Australia, the treasurer said it was
  incumbent on politicians, interest groups, unions, and experts to help build
  “a new generation of prosperity”. After 900 submissions and dozens of
  ministerial mini-roundtables over the past six weeks, Chalmers said “broadly,
  we’re looking to build consensus around three types of outcomes”. “Clear
  reform directions – areas where there’s momentum and broad agreement on the
  direction of travel even if unanimity isn’t there yet. “Specific reforms – the
  handful of changes we could all agree on now. “And ongoing priorities – where
  there’s appetite in the room for further work.” The first day will focus on
  “resilience” and will be opened by Anthony Albanese, who will deliver a brief
  address, followed by Chalmers and then the Reserve Bank’s governor, Michele
  Bullock. Today’s three sessions will take place behind closed doors in the
  cabinet room in parliament house and will cover issues such as international
  trade opportunities and how to develop and attract skilled workers and
  investment. Days two and three will be about productivity and budget
  resilience, respectively. Penny Wong has responded to Israel’s decision to
  revoke the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority,
  calling it “unjustified”. In a statement released early this morning, Wong
  said: At a time when dialogue and diplomacy are needed more than ever, the
  Netanyahu government is isolating Israel and undermining international efforts
  towards peace and a two-state solution. This is an unjustified reaction,
  following Australia’s decision to recognise Palestine. We will continue to
  work with partners as we contribute international momentum to a two-state
  solution, a ceasefire in Gaza and release of the hostages. Australia welcomes
  different races, religions and views, united by respect for each other’s
  humanity and for each other’s right to live in peace. We safeguard our
  communities and protect all Australians from hate and harm. The Australian
  government will always take decisive action against antisemitism. Palestinian
  Authority condemns Israel visa revocations The Palestinian Authority has
  condemned Israel’s move. In a post to social media, it said: The foreign
  ministry condemns the arbitrary decision of the occupation against Australian
  diplomats… considering it illegal and in contradiction with the Geneva
  conventions, international law, and international legitimacy resolutions that
  do not grant the occupying authority such powers. The ministry affirms that
  the state of Palestine does not recognise this decision and deals with
  Australian diplomats as representatives accredited to the state of Palestine,
  and stresses that such measures reflect Israeli arrogance and a state of
  political imbalance, and that they will only increase Australia’s and other
  countries’ determination to adhere to international law, the two-state
  solution, and the recognition of the state of Palestine to achieve peace.
  Relations between Australia and Israel have taken another turn for the worse
  amid a tit-for-tat diplomatic spat over visas. A week after Australia said it
  would recognise Palestinian statehood, the Albanese government yesterday
  refused a visa for a far-right member of Israel’s ruling coalition. Israel
  responded last night when the foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced that
  he revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian
  Authority, citing Australia’s “unjustified refusal” to grant visas to Israeli
  figures and its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood. Having announced
  his decision via X, Sa’ar then followed that up with a Hebrew-language video
  message released by his office, according to the Times of Israel. In it, the
  minister said that “Australia is acting against Israel, Australia is
  persecuting Israel,” and that its move to bar individuals “must be understood
  in this context”. “And we will take additional measures,” Sa’ar adds. “To be
  continued.” More here: Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m
  Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it’ll be Nick Visser
  with the main action. The Albanese government risks becoming embroiled in a
  worsening war of words with Israel after the government in Tel Aviv revoked
  the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority in
  response to Canberra refusing a visa for a far-right Israeli MP. The Israeli
  foreign minister called Australia’s decision shameful and said more action
  would follow. We have more coming up, including the reaction of the
  Palestinian Authority which condemned the move as “arbitrary” and arrogant.
  Plus: it’s the first day of the government’s much-sizzled economic reform
  summit in Canberra, and we’ll bring you all the action as it happens. Stay
  tuned!

What we learned, 19 August 2025 With that, we’re wrapping up the blog. Before we go, here are today’s big stories: The Western Australia government “put a very rosy spin” on a summary report of a project checking if pollutants from Woodside were damaging 50,000-year-old rock art, according to a private email sent by the lead scientist. The organisation behind the age assurance technology trial that will inform how to keep under-16s off social media has frozen out key stakeholders amid media leaks and resignations of two members. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has cited “harrowing stories” in the state’s royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence and flagged a full response before the end of the year. One Nation senator Warwick Stacey, elected at the May election, is resigning for health reasons. James Paterson, the shadow finance minister, said the Coalition would be open to a contribution to a peacekeeping effort to Ukraine, a shift from a stance from the former opposition leader Peter Dutton who described any involvement as a “thought bubble by the prime minister”. Liberal MP Garth Hamilton proposed this morning Australia start paying migrants to go back to their home countries if they’re struggling to find work or a place to live. Thanks for your company today. We’ll be back early tomorrow. Qld supreme court rules an abortion is in best interests of 11-year-old pregnant girl The Queensland supreme court has ruled that an 11-year-old girl should be allowed to have abortion, deeming it “necessary” given her “physical, psychological and social circumstances”. In a judgment made in April and published today, Justice Frances Williams determined that termination of the girl’s pregnancy was in her best interests. The girl, referred to as C in the judgment, had what the court deemed “transient” understanding of the meaning of her pregnancy, and was described as “emotionally and psychologically immature”. As a result, she was determined not to be “Gillick competent”, meaning she did not fully understand what it meant to terminate her pregnancy and could not give consent for the procedure. The judgment noted: If a child is not Gillick competent to give consent to the termination of a pregnancy, there is a risk that the medical procedure may be an assault or trespass to the person and unlawful in the absence of a court making appropriate orders. The supreme court determined that an abortion was in C’s best interest. It found: The overwhelming medical evidence is that the risks involved in continuing C’s pregnancy are higher than the risks involved in termination … The evidence before the Court is that C has repeatedly expressed the view that she does not want to continue with the pregnancy. C’s mother has also expressed a clear preference for C to undergo a termination of her pregnancy. A motion of no confidence in the Tasmanian Liberal government led by Jeremy Rockliff has been defeated by 24 votes to 10. The motion was moved by the Labor leader, Dean Winter, on the first day of parliament after the 19 July state election. The Greens and crossbenchers elected at the last poll sided with the Liberal government, confirming its control of the state parliament. With all parties short of the 18 seats needed for a majority, Rockliff and Winter have spent the past month jockeying for support. Australia examining possible security treaty breach by Nauru because of $1bn China deal Australia is trying to confirm if Nauru has breached a security treaty after a $1bn deal signed with a Chinese company earlier this month. Nauru must receive Australia’s signoff on any partnership, arrangement or engagement with a third nation when it comes to security, including critical infrastructure such as banking and telecommunications. Under a treaty signed in December 2024, Australia would prop up Nauru’s banking sector, provide $100m in budget support and $40m for policing in exchange for an effective veto right over other security agreements. Pacific minister Pat Conroy said the Australian government was working with Nauru to determine whether a development deal with the China rural revitalisation and development corporation, signed on 5 August, activated treaty obligations. That is a really important treaty for us that helps position us as a security partner of choice with Nauru. – AAP More fire ants have been detected in central Queensland mines as authorities scramble to contain an outbreak of one of the world’s worst invasive species. The National Fire Ant Eradication program dogs sniffed out fire ant nests at five mine sites in Central Highlands and Isaac Council regions between 12 and 14 August. The ants were detected about 800km from the closest known infestation zone in central Queensland for the first time in history in July, with a major outbreak at a BHP Broadmeadow coalmine. The eradication program has issued a statement saying its teams are working across central Queensland to contain the outbreak and to determine “whether equipment or materials that can carry fire ants have moved from the affected mines, potentially spreading the invasive species further”. Delays continue on Sydney train network as peak hour begins Buses have been requested to supplement trains on Sydney’s airport rail line, as delays on some of the city’s busiest routes have continued into peak hour. In a statement, Sydney Trains said passengers should continue to allow extra travel time on T2, T3 and T8 Airport and south services after delays following a track fault between Town Hall and Central stations this morning: As well as increased service gaps, stops and departure platforms may change at short notice, Buses have been requested to supplement the T8 line between Central station and Sydney Airport’s domestic and international terminals, as well as between Campbelltown and Macarthur. Adani to invest $50m in Queensland Charmichael coalmine Multinational mining firm Adani will invest $50m in its central Queensland Carmichael coalmine, the company said today. The capital investment will increase production at the thermal coalmine by a third over the next four years to 16m tonnes a year. Bravus Mining and Resources chief operating officer, Mick Crowe, said the company had already increased production to more than 10m tonnes per annum over the past three years. Engineering studies and assessments have been completed, and work to deliver increased production will begin by adding more capacity to the Carmichael mine accommodation village. The Australian company Bravus Mining and Resources is part of the global Adani Group, founded and chaired by Indian magnate Gautam Adani. Qld police service opposes pro-Palestine march across Brisbane Story Bridge The Queensland police say a planned pro-Palestine march across Brisbane’s Story Bridge this Sunday will create security risks and disrupt business. A spokesperson for the police said it had suggested alternative routes to organisers that would minimise the risk to public safety and disruption to the community. It said safety concerns include that the proposed bridge route is not designed for pedestrian gatherings, and that serious disruption would occur to traffic, emergency vehicle access and local businesses. There is also a need to maintain essential access routes for community safety, the spokesperson said. The QPS respects the right to peacefully assemble; however, this must be balanced with the need to ensure public safety and minimise disruption to the broader community. While the QPS has concerns if the march goes over the Story Bridge, the service will always respect the decision of the courts. Brisbane police will have a strong presence on the day to ensure public safety, manage traffic and respond to any incidents. Liberal’s Dave Sharma criticises government’s decision to cancel Simcha Rothman’s visa Liberal senator Dave Sharma, a former ambassador to Israel, has taken issue with comments made by Katy Gallagher, this afternoon, about “open dialogue and discussion”. Here’s what he told the ABC: They have gone and cancelled the visa of a member of parliament of Israel, who sits within the government and Coalition. So how can you say you’re committed to dialogue and diplomacy and open channels when you are preventing any interaction from occurring? I think those two statements are at odds with one another. Simcha Rothman has described Palestinian children in Gaza as “enemies” and called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank. On Monday, he was denied entry into Australia before he was scheduled to join a “solidarity tour”. Explaining his decision, the home affairs minister Tony Burke said: “our government takes a hard line on people who seek to come to our country and spread division”: If you are coming to Australia to spread a message of hate and division, we don’t want you here. Under our government, Australia will be a country where everyone can be safe, and feel safe. Katy Gallagher: Australia’s relationship with Israel not broken The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, says Australia’s diplomatic relationship with Israel is “not at all” broken. Israel’s foreign minister has revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, citing Australia’s “unjustified refusal” to grant visas to Israeli figures and its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar said the decision was made after the Albanese government cancelled Simcha Rothman’s visa on Monday before his speaking tour schedule for this month. Gallagher told the ABC the decision was “very unfortunate” and that the government would “always stand for dialogue and diplomacy, particularly in times of conflict”. Australia has to be able to have positions on matters about other countries, or in this case recognition of the Palestinian state, and still maintain relationships with other countries. We will not agree on everything … It’s about open dialogue and discussion, even if there are areas of disagreement. It’s the way we will continue to operate across the world. NSW $334m regional roads fund to be scrutinised by auditor-general’s office A large fund for road projects will be scrutinised as more money is tipped into road upgrades in a region approaching a crucial byelection, AAP reports. The NSW government’s $334m Regional Roads Fund – some of which has not yet been allocated – will be examined by the state’s auditor-general’s office. It is assessing whether Transport for NSW designed and implemented the grants program in compliance with guidelines for the administration of public expenditure and relevant legislative requirements, focusing on grants to 19 local councils. The roads minister, Jenny Aitchison, says it is a standard investigation. She told a budget estimates hearing the audit office’s interest stemmed from the previous government’s method of funding, which included allegations of pork-barrelling. One project – the Thornton Bridge duplication project – is near the minister’s home in the Hunter region’s Maitland electorate. She denies any conflict of interest. There are 20,000 or 30,000 other people who live in that area. That road is of no material benefit to me or my family. Research foundation calls for alcohol law overhaul to help protect women and children The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education has called for an urgent overhaul of alcohol laws after the South Australian royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence found it was a significant factor in violence. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, has accepted seven of the royal commission’s 136 recommendations. The state government will respond to the rest of them by the end of the year. Several of the royal commission’s recommendations related to the sale and supply of alcohol. The foundation’s chief executive, Ayla Chorley, welcomed the recommendations: Survivors have consistently told us you cannot address violence towards women and children without considering the impact of alcohol harm – now they’ve finally been heard. Barred far-right Israeli politician slated to speak virtually The right-leaning Australian Jewish Association says it will host an online event with far-right Israeli politician, Simcha Rothman, saying the “Jewish community won’t bow down to Tony Burke or Penny Wong”. Rothman, a member of the far-right Religious Zionism party, was scheduled to appear in person as part of a “solidarity tour” later this week before his visa was cancelled on Monday because of fears his visit would ignite tensions in the community. Rothman, a member of Netanyahu’s governing coalition, is a vocal critic of a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and has called for Israel’s total annexation of the occupied West Bank territories. The AJA today said the group intended to host an online event with Rothman in defiance of the visa cancellation. The show will go on. The Jew-haters will not win … The Jewish community won’t bow down to Tony Burke or Penny Wong. A date has not yet been set for the online event. Marles: Israel’s visa decision ‘disappointing and unjustified’ The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, says Israel’s decision to revoke the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority is “disappointing and unjustified”. In a post to X on Monday night, Gideon Sa’ar said the decision was made after the Albanese government’s cancellation of Simcha Rothman’s visa on Monday before his speaking tour, this month. The Israeli foreign minister said he had also instructed the embassy in Canberra to “carefully examine any official Australian visa application for entry to Israel”. Marles addressed the issue during a press conference: This is a disappointing and unjustified reaction to Australia and our decision around the recognition of a Palestinian state. This is a moment where we need to be promoting dialogue between our countries, and this is a very disappointing and unjustified step, which has been taken by Israel. Australia leading international action to protect humanitarian aid workers Australia has pledged tangible action to protect humanitarian aid workers, at a time when people who dedicate themselves to helping others in war are killed in record numbers. More than 380 humanitarian workers were killed in conflict zones in 2024, marking the deadliest year on record and a 31%rise from the previous year, according to Aid Worker Security Database statistics released on today. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, is spearheading a pledge to protect humanitarian personnel after convening a ministerial group with several other nations at a United Nations conference in September 2024. The international development minister, Anne Aly, has confirmed it will be launched on the margins of the United Nations meeting in New York during the final week of September: The declaration will be an important demonstration of our collective commitment to upholding international humanitarian law. It will also include practical steps that will increase aid worker safety. – AAP Sydney commuters are being advised to allow for extra time before this afternoon’s peak hour, as a train track fault this morning has continued to cause delays on some of the city’s busiest lines. In a statement, Sydney Trains said urgent track repairs were finished at 11.30am today after a fault between Town Hall and Central stations caused trains to stop running on the city circle via Museum station. Trains resumed running at 12.00pm, but passengers on the T2, T3 and T8 lines are being warned of knock-on delays this afternoon. Train crew were displaced by this morning’s incident, which also led to a temporary speed restriction on other lines. “It is easing as we get closer to the peak, but obviously we’re getting very close to the peak now,” said a spokesperson for Sydney Trains, advising commuters to allow plenty of time and check service updates. That’s all from me. Henry Belot will take over from here to guide you through the afternoon’s news. Take care. EV popularity prompts consideration of broader road-user charges Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers have all but confirmed an EV road user charge is in the works. But Guardian Australia understands the government is considering phasing in the charge over a number of years, and that it could start with the country’s small fleet of electric trucks. While the vast majority of vehicles on the road remain petrol- and diesel-powered, that is expected to change in coming decades. As combustion engines disappear, so will the revenue from the fuel excise – which is worth about $17bn a year and is ostensibly paid to the states to help them pay for road maintenance. In fact, the money just pours into the federal government’s coffers like any other tax. You can read more about the plan here: NSW treasurer says its a ‘good time’ to figure out future of road user charges as EVs grow in popularity Daniel Mookhey, the NSW treasurer, says as more electric vehicles hit the roads, “it’s a good time for us to be figuring out what is the future of the road user charging system”. He told the ABC earlier today: I think it’s fair and reasonable that everybody who uses our roads should be making a contribution. NSW has legislated a road user charge for EVs from mid-2027, starting at 2.9c per kilometre for battery and hydrogen fuel cell EVs, or 2.4c for a plug-in hybrid EV. Mookhey, who is representing the states and territories at this week’s economic reform roundtable, says: We do think that shows one example of how the nation could make some quick progress here. The NSW charge would not start if a national scheme is adopted beforehand. A legal challenge against a planned pro-Palestine protest on the Brisbane Story Bridge will be heard on Thursday. The Queensland Police Service is seeking to halt a march by Justice for Palestine Magan-djin planned for 1pm this Sunday. Brisbane magistrates court will hear the application at 9am. Organisers say they expect about 7,000 people to attend. Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner says the bridge will be closed to traffic for the protest if the march is approved, but he says he is concerned about people’s safety. He says some marchers might use closed footpaths attached to the main deck of the bridge, which are currently closed for safety reasons. Schrinner says: We’re also concerned about the safety of the wider community as well, and the harmony of the wider community. Peaceful protests, they’re great, you know, it’s a right of every Australian. But there have been some points where it’s gone too far. And terrorist chants, waving around photos of terrorist leaders, [it’s] not something that contributes to a harmonious community. Opposition has ‘serious concerns’ amid escalating diplomatic row between Israel and Australia The opposition has criticised the Albanese government for its handling of its relationship with Israel after the Netanyahu government revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority in an escalating diplomatic row. Simcha Rothman, a far-right politician in Netanyahu’s governing coalition, was barred entry into Australia before a speaking tour this month, on the basis of his previous commentary and concerns it would ignite domestic tensions. In response, Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced Australian diplomats in the West Bank would have their visas revoked and the Israeli embassy in Canberra would now “carefully examine any official Australian visa application for entry to Israel”. The shadow foreign affairs minister, Michaelia Cash, today said the Coalition held “serious concerns” about the escalation, accusing the government of “deepening diplomatic rifts and undermining Australia’s standing on the world stage”. Cash said: The Albanese government has badly mismanaged this relationship at a time when careful diplomacy is more important than ever. Instead of maintaining trust with Israel – one of our closest democratic allies – Labor has recklessly inflamed tensions and undermined Australia’s credibility. Rothman accused the Australian government of “blatant antisemitism” for cancelling his visa. Consumers are the most confident they’ve been in 3.5 years The “long period of pessimism” in Aussie households is “finally coming to an end”, according to a new Westpac survey showing consumer confidence has reached a three-and-a-half-year high. It’s been 42 months since Australia last registered a consumer sentiment index score above 100 – the threshold above which optimistic survey responses outnumber pessimistic ones. That’s the second longest period of consistent gloom since the survey began in 1974, beaten only by the period around the early 1990s recession. As inflation and interest rates have dropped, we are now “much less anxious” about our finances, and even “cautiously positive” about the state of the economy, according to the monthly sentiment survey. The Reserve Bank’s third rate cut of the year – announced last week – has certainly helped, but Westpac reported a lift in mood across households, not just those with mortgages. Indeed, the biggest jump in confidence was among renters. Experts hope a more upbeat consumer will spend a bit more and give the economy a bit of a boost this year after a sluggish start. Reversing Morrison-era fee hike to arts degrees will require ‘significant dollars’, Clare says Education minister Jason Clare also pointed to the Job-ready Graduates (JRG) package, introduced by the Morrison government, which drastically increased prices for humanities degrees. He agreed the policy had been an “abject failure” because more people were doing arts degrees than when it was introduced to encourage students into other courses, but said reversing it would be a “significant change” with “significant dollars attached to it”. We’re taking reform one step at a time. Whether it’s the structure of universities or whether it’s fixing JRG, reform is a bit like eating an elephant – one bite at a time. I’ve never ruled out reform here. It’s all about what you do first. University governance ‘not up to scratch’, education minister says The education minister says you’ve been “living under a rock” if you don’t think Australia has challenges with university governance, after announcing reforms to strengthen the powers of the regulator. Asked about tearful testimony by an academic at a Senate inquiry into higher education last week, Jason Clare told the AFR higher education summit today that university governance was “not up to scratch”. Whether it’s the evidence of sexual assault and harassment at universities or in student accommodation, whether it’s evidence of wage theft in our universities or whether it’s the really distressing evidence that we witnessed last week in the Senate inquiry, all of this tells us that university governance is not up to scratch and that we need to fix it. ACCC to investigate energy retailers about concerns they are misleading customers Australia’s consumer regulator will investigate whether energy retailers are misleading customers with the way they describe and promote their plans, after a “designated complaint” was lodged by consumer advocacy group Choice. The Albanese government gave Choice, the Consumer Action Law Centre, and the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia the ability to make a “designated complaint” to the ACCC. These are effectively super complaints about a systemic or significant problem affecting consumers or small businesses, which compel the regulator to respond within 90 days. The ACCC said today it was satisfied that Choice’s complaint met the relevant conditions, with the regulator’s deputy chair, Catriona Lowe, saying: We are concerned that consumers may be misled or deceived by plan names or descriptions of plans that offer ‘savings’ that are not genuine, or that consumers may be discouraged from switching to cheaper plans that are available to them. Choice said in May it had analysed nearly 400 energy bills between January and March 2025, which found many retailers were reusing identical names for energy plans, despite offering them at different prices. Sydney CBD’s busiest train lines face delays because of urgent track work Passengers on some of Sydney’s busiest train lines face delays this afternoon, after an incident requiring urgent track repairs, this morning. There are delays across the T2 Leppington, T3 Liverpool and the city circle lines after an incident affecting the section between Town Hall and Central stations, Transport for NSW says. Trains came to a standstill earlier, although a spokesperson for Sydney Trains says they have since resumed. Route planner TripView is showing services on both T2 and T3 lines from this morning running more than 90 minutes late, with delays in both directions of travel. Transport for NSW has advised passengers to allow plenty of extra time, warning that departure platforms may change at short notice. Former RBA governor says Albanese government made him take cost-of-living blame Former Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe says the Albanese government pushed the blame for the rising cost of living on to the RBA and “fed into” his personal unpopularity. Lowe oversaw 12 of the 13 interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 as the RBA fought inflation by increasing borrowing costs, and pushing mortgage payments higher just as Labor came to power. He left the bank in September 2023 when the government declined to extend his term. The former governor said the government had pushed blame on to him and the bank to avoid being punished by voters. It’s much easier for the political class to say ‘things need to slow, we’ll get our central banks to do that, and they can take the blame’. I remember, there was a period that I was the most unpopular person in the country, at least according to the media, and the government kind of fed into that. The central bank governor doesn’t get elected … so they can play the baddie. It’s much harder for the political class to play the baddie. Lowe made the comments when he joined a talk with the UNSW Business School’s Richard Holden and the e61 thinktank’s chief executive, Michael Brennan, advocating for a new framework to limit federal government spending ahead of the Albanese government’s economic reform roundtable. Lowe said the RBA’s interest rate policy had pushed against profligate government spending much of his career because governments wanted to avoid public blame for living costs. He said: We were exercising restraint, and the government was busily compensating people for the fact that things are so tough, adding to spending in the economy. Canavan says Nationals still considering position on net zero Nationals senator Matt Canavan says his party is still considering its position on net zero, as he helps lead a party room discussion on the climate crisis measure reviled by many in the Coalition. Canavan, who is hosting his own productivity roundtable tomorrow in parliament house about energy issues, said his party had been “forced” into supporting net zero under former Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison: He never allowed a debate the joint party room. At least now, with the policy being up for review, hopefully that debate will occur, and I’m hoping that it will be informed by some very good work that we are planning to commission. Canavan said it would take “a few more months to have the debate”, indicating there might not be an imminent timeline for a final decision – but with loud voices like himself, Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack opposing net zero, there is a direction of travel very clearly emerging for the Nationals. Canavan was out front of parliament spruiking his own sideline event, which will run tomorrow in APH. He said former treasury officials, former representatives of major business groups, and economists would attend. We asked if we should call it the “rogue roundtable” or “shadow roundtable”, which Canavan laughed off. With all the action from today’s summit occurring behind closed doors in the cabinet room, people like Canavan are looking to grab some attention while things are quiet. Australia’s largest biotech company, CSL, says it expects to avoid Donald Trump’s pharmaceutical tariffs, but its share prices have plummeted anyway. The company today released its annual report and announced a restructure, splitting out its vaccine production arm and sacking about 3,000 staff. Revenue for 2024-25 came in lower than expected, although profits beat analyst expectations, rising 14% to US$3.2bn on an adjusted basis. The US president has threatened tariffs and crackdowns on pharmaceutical imports, potentially including those from Australia-based CSL, but the company expects its blood plasma and other products should manage to get an exemption. CSL’s chief executive, Paul McKenzie, told investors: The plasma is sourced all in the US … [and] for many other parts of our portfolio, the active pharmaceutical ingredient is actually sourced in the US, as well. So, that would mitigate it. And for other parts of the organisation, we will look at our supply chain [and] where the products come from. But investors didn’t like the revenue undershoot or the surprise restructure, selling the stock and driving the share price down $33, or 12%, which would be one of CSL’s biggest-ever one-day falls if sustained. Victorian opposition leader denies shift in position on Suburban Rail Loop Victoria’s opposition leader, Brad Battin, has denied the party’s position on the Suburban Rail Loop has changed. Asked about Matthew Guy’s comments this morning, Battin says his position was “identical”. He went on: The government have a responsibility right now, they could stop the project before December, before the holes have been dug. But should they not do that and they dig two holes in the ground, the project will continue but we want to make sure that it is in the best interest of Victorians. Battin also added that he doubted tunnelling would begin on time, citing delays on other projects including the West Gate tunnel: Let’s wait and see what happens when it comes to the boring machines, and if the government can get anything [done] on time. But we know the chances of that are quite unlikely. Woodside CEO says company looks forward to ‘positive outcome’ from government on North West Shelf extension We reported earlier on Woodside CEO Meg O’Neill’s frustrations the company hasn’t been granted final federal approval for its controversial plan to extend the life of a major gas plant in WA. Here’s more from her remarks: O’Neill said timelines behind such decisions need to be considered to boost productivity. She said earlier: It’s frustrating that we still don’t have the final federal improvement approval. Time frames are certainly something that needs to be considered when we’re thinking about how to lift productivity in Australia. We know that the federal government understands how important the North West Shelf extension is for our communities, customers and our workforce, and therefore the nation and we look forward to a positive final outcome in the very near future. As we have previously reported, the extension is expected to be responsible for about 87.9m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent every year in the decades ahead, after the gas has been exported and burned, according to Woodside’s own numbers. O’Neill said this morning that Woodside recorded no “significant environmental impacts” during the half-year period and remained on track to achieve its near-term greenhouse gas emissions goals. How did the royal commission in South Australia come about? After four women were killed in a single week in South Australia, the state government set up a royal commission into domestic, sexual and family violence in July last year. Natasha Stott Despoja, former senator and ambassador for women and girls and founding chair of Our Watch, wrote in the foreword of the 664-page report that the commission received more than 380 submissions, held 48 public hearing sessions, more than 170 listening sessions, and consulted with hundreds more people. She wrote that she had heard stories that would haunt her, and that the report was a “call to action” for SA, which has “lost its way” on domestic violence. The recommendations include a national standard for responsible media reporting, a dedicated state ministerial portfolio, more resources for police, more accommodation, free healthcare for victim survivors, screening for non-fatal strangulation, and strategies to minimise harm to young people on social media from pornography, the manosphere and “incels”. Victoria opposition won’t stop work on Suburban Rail Loop if tunnelling starts before next election The Victorian opposition spokesperson for transport, Matthew Guy, has confirmed the Coalition won’t stop work on the Suburban Rail Loop if tunnelling begins before the election. Guy was opposition leader during the 2018 and 2022 elections. At the more recent poll, he pledged to pause the project and invest the funding into health instead. But at an ABC forum on Tuesday morning, he told host Raf Epstein his position had changed: If the project has commenced and the tunnels are half constructed, well, we can’t fill them in. It will cost us more to stop a project than complete it. So the project will then proceed. There’s no doubt about that. We’ll have to make sure that it’s managed appropriately. And unlike every other major project, it’s managed on time and on budget, which would be rare for this government to have. The minister responsible for the loop, Harriet Shing, says three contracts totalling about $7bn have been signed and another is due soon: We’ve got tunnel boring machines that are arriving later this year. They will be in the ground and doing their work next year. Commissioner behind SA report says findings present ‘once-in-a-generation’ chance to address domestic violence Natasha Stott Despoja, the commissioner of South Australia’s royal commission, called the report a “a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our state to address the issue of domestic, family and sexual violence in a way that we haven’t before”. She said that task would not be easy: It will require leadership and I’m so pleased to hear the premier talk about the steward role and the governance piece that you’ve already accepted. It will require significant investment, reinvestment, or uplift in some things that already exist, but also the creation of new systems. Stott Despoja said it was a significant day for the state, acknowledging that the recommendations would take time. She said: This is not a tick and flick exercise. It’s not about implementing for the sake of it, it’s about getting it right. … It’s time now for our state to act with courage and lead with courage. And I have every confidence we will. Malinauskas says judicial system needs trauma-informed cultural change to deal with domestic violence cases Peter Malinauskas has also flagged changes to how the judicial system handles domestic violence cases: I think there’s a need for some cultural change within our judicial system when they contemplate how domestic violence cases are handled. The idea that domestic violence victims would be physically in the same environment as the alleged perpetrator in the lead-up to a particular case or a hearing is not acceptable. There are some practical recommendations around getting judicial officers to undergo some trauma-informed training that speaks to a cultural change. Malinauskas said the South Australian government intends to respond to all royal commission recommendations by the end of the year. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, is holding a press conference to release the findings of the state’s royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence. The royal commission has made 136 recommendations. Malinauskas said the state government would consider and examine the recommendations before formally responding to them. But the government has accepted seven of the recommendations immediately. These include the creation of a “stand-alone ministerial portfolio” and the creation of “a stewardship function within government”. The government has also accepted a recommendation to engage with people who have lived experience of domestic, family and sexual violence as it continues to develop a comprehensive response to the commission’s report. Malinauskas said the report contained “some pretty harrowing stories” and that change was desperately needed in response to their experiences. Tragically we know one-in-four women and up to one-in-eight men at some point during the course of their life will experience this type of violence. That is wholly unacceptable in a modern liberal democracy such as ours, where we often espouse the virtues of the collectively held values that we aspire to. Early view from the economics roundtable: optimism is in the air We have an early view from inside the cabinet room, where the good and the great are discussing how to make Australia’s economy more resilient. Shiro Armstrong, an economics professor at the ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said he told attendees that we should not get sucked into the rising protectionist trade policies and that domestic policies should be aimed at providing the certainty and confidence that is increasingly at a premium globally. Armstrong told Sky News he was impressed with the vibe in the room, which he described as “extremely constructive” and “very optimistic”. “Everyone had time to talk. Nothing was rushed. And really collegial between all the different interests.” A good start, at least before the roundtable moves on to thornier issues such as tax and regulation in the coming days. Woodside CEO frustrated gas plant extension still waiting for final approval The Woodside CEO, Meg O’Neill, says it is “frustrating” the resources giant has not got “final federal government approval” for its controversial plan to extend the life of a major gas plant in Western Australia. O’Neill spoke to investors and journalists in a teleconference from Sydney after Woodside released its half-year financial results earlier this morning, posting a 24% drop in profits. The underlying net profit after tax of Australia’s largest oil and gas producer fell to $US1.25bn (about $1.92bn in Australian dollars) in the six months to 30 June from $US1.63bn in the same period last year. Woodside has been in the spotlight after the Albanese Labor government in May gave the green light for an extension for the company’s North West Shelf gas project on the Burrup peninsula to run for an additional 40 years, from 2030 to 2070. Guardian Australia understands Woodside and the government are yet to reach a consensus on the conditions required for final approval of the project, which include limiting the impact of air emissions levels from the operation of an expanded on-shore Karratha gas plant. Government to strengthen TEQSA, the higher education regulator The federal government will strengthen the powers of the higher education regulator in a bid to respond to “systemic risks” facing the sector. The Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) has not significantly changed since it was established 15 years ago to regulate the quality of higher education providers. The minister for education, Jason Clare, said there was a “good argument that TEQSA needs better tools to be able to step in and act when it’s justified in the public interest”. In the coming weeks, the government will release a consultation paper on how to modernise TEQSA “to better meet the standards students, staff and the community expect of our universities”. Dr Mary Russell, chief executive officer of TEQSA, said governance failures, risks to student safety, questions of financial viability and the impact of new technologies pointed to the need for a legislative framework that “better supports TEQSA’s ability to respond quickly and proportionately to emerging, systemic, and acute risks”. The resignation of a One Nation senator from NSW is a shock, but Warwick Stacey’s entry into parliament was a shock in and of itself. The minor rightwing party, led by Pauline Hanson, wasn’t expected to gain a seat in NSW, giving it its equal-best result in an election. But who is Stacey? According to several bios (more of which you can read about here) Stacey was in the British army and became a troop commander with the Special Air Service regiment, and in Australia was a member of the Army reserve. Stacey also worked in the Middle East as a military consultant. Quitting soon after entering parliament, Stacey hasn’t given his maiden speech, but in an address to the Senate (which parliamentarians can do before they give their first speech) he called Welcome to Country ceremonies and acknowledgment of Country addresses the “radical left’s progressive agenda to divide Australians”. All four One Nation senators turned their backs in the chamber during the acknowledgment of country on the first sitting day of the new parliament. Conservation group says roundtable must protect both economy and the environment The economic reform summit in Canberra is hearing from the Reserve Bank governor, Michele Bullock, this morning, before moving on to sessions about “international risks, opportunities and trade”. Ahead of participating in the event on Tuesday, the Australian Conservation Foundation says the talks must boost both the economy and protection of the natural environment. Chief executive Kelly O’Shanassy will be present for talks on better regulation and approvals and will call for changes to the national environmental laws to keep major approval powers with the federal government. She said: Better coordination across federal, state and territory governments is needed, but the simplistic idea of handing over commonwealth responsibilities to state and territory governments for ‘single touch approvals’ won’t work. Among other contributions, O’Shanassy will call for new national environment standards, to define the rules on nature protection and guide project proponents on where they can build and where nature needs to be protected. She said an independent national environment protection agency is needed to administer the standards, “through making assessment and approval decisions, ensure compliance and enforcement and oversee any accredited arrangements that allow for further efficiencies.” O’Shanassy said: Faster decisions are crucial, as is stronger nature protection. Australia’s failed national nature law facilitates neither. The national nature law contains a series of convoluted processes with no defined outcomes or transparent institutions – a recipe for slow, unpredictable decisions and ecological and economic decline. Internet provider iiNet has just reported a large cyber incident after an unknown third party accessed its systems. The company said: iiNet has been impacted by a cyber incident involving unauthorised access to its order management system by an unknown third party. The system contains limited personal information. Importantly, it does not contain copies or details of customer identity document details (such as passport or driver’s licences), credit card or banking information. The company said it confirmed the incident on Saturday 16 August and enacted its incident response plan to determine the extent of the breach. It said a list of email addresses and phone numbers had been hacked from its system, including 280,000 active iiNet email addresses, 20,000 active landline phone numbers, as well as some inactive email addresses and numbers. About 10,000 iiNet usernames, street addresses and phone numbers, as well as 1,700 modem set-up passwords, were also taken. The company said: iiNet urges our customers to remain vigilant, especially to any suspicious communications received via email, text or phone call. If in doubt, contact iiNet directly or seek independent advice from trusted sources, including the Australian Cyber Security Centre. More details are here. Analysis reveals Australia’s largest gas guzzlers Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry uses 13 times more gas than local manufacturing, according to new analysis by climate activist group Market Forces. The vast majority of gas used in Australia is directed towards LNG exports, followed by gas power plants and manufacturing, according to the report. Only 10 facilities – mainly those producing alumina and ammonia – made up more than half of manufacturing gas use. According to Market Forces estimates, the five largest manufacturing gas users could require carbon offsets up to $1.3bn over the decade if they failed to reduce their reliance on gas. Kyle Robertson, Market Forces’ head of research, said Australia’s biggest manufacturers, particularly alumina and ammonia producers, need to immediately step up and invest much more in the transition to renewable energy. Manufacturers guzzle a lot of our gas but 13 times more is gobbled up, turned into liquified natural gas and sent overseas. Canavan to convene rebel roundtable on energy prices While the government’s anointed luminaries are huddled in the cabinet room without their mobile phones and natural light, Matt Canavan plans to convene a “real” productivity roundtable on the grass in front of parliament house. Senator Canavan has joined fellow National Barnaby Joyce in calling for getting rid of the net zero target and replacing renewable energy with new coal plants. So it’s no surprise that the rebel roundtable late tomorrow morning will address what they call “the elephant in the room”: rising power prices. Canavan and a staffer have been walking the halls of parliament house this morning wearing T-shirts emblazoned with “Energy prices are the real productivity issue”. The AFR has reported that a former Productivity Commission chair, Gary Banks, will give a keynote speech. Other invitees reportedly include an ex-Business Council of Australia boss Tony Shepherd and an executive of the Housing Industry Association, Simon Croft. Mining giant BHP paid $4bn less in Australian tax while hiking profits over the year to June after iron and coal prices slid, as the company hikes copper production to switch towards green industry. The price BHP received for its steel making coal prices fell nearly 40% in 2024-25 compared to the previous year and energy coal prices fell 10%. The company’s coal output fell after it sold two mines and wet weather slowed down truck productivity. BHP’s annual report, out today, said Australian coal supply would likely recover but said Queensland’s coal royalty scheme had discouraged it from long-term investments in local mining, joining other miners’ criticisms. Iron production increased but prices fell by a fifth, with BHP predicting resilient Chinese and Indian demand would keep commodity markets moving but noting tariffs were dragging global economic growth. Together, that saw global revenue fell by US$4.4bn to US$51.3bn. Tax payments in Australia fell even further, as the company reduced its effective tax rate from 33% to 32.1%. Once you add royalty payments, BHP paid A$10.5bn (US$6.8bn) in tax in 2024-25, an A$4bn (US$2.7bn) fall from A$14.5bn (US$9.5bn) the previous year. BHP’s tax payments in Chile doubled to US$3.2bn as it hiked production at the world’s largest copper mine, Escondida. The company produced 2 Mt of copper over the year for the first time – less than 1% of its iron output – but it hopes to double output from South Australia and has more projects in the pipeline. More efficient copper mining helped profits rise over US$1bn to US$9bn. Copper is playing an increasingly important role in the business, now responsible for almost half of underlying earnings. The metal’s importance to green technology has driven up global demand and prices. Hanson describes Stacey as a ‘man of principle’ One Nation will get to name someone as his replacement “in coming weeks”, Hanson’s office said, which will keep the party’s Senate numbers at four. The party is not yet naming that replacement. Hanson said: It is with profound regret that we farewell him from the Senate so soon after he was elected. I was delighted when it was announced Senator Stacey had won a seat representing NSW. I knew he would bring a wealth of knowledge, experience and expertise to our team along with the strong conservative values that made Australia great. I wish Senator Stacey all the very best with his health and his future. Pauline Hanson said this morning One Nation senator Warwick Stacey, elected at the May election, is resigning for health reasons. Stacey was elected as a senator for NSW and helped double One Nation’s Senate numbers from two to four. He said in a statement he was dealing with “personal health issues”. Unfortunately, I will be unable to fully dedicate myself to the role as I deal with my personal health issues. I don’t think a person elected to parliament should be anything less than completely dedicated to a role entrusted to them by voters, so I’m resigning to make way for someone who can do that on behalf of the people of NSW. Stacey was only sworn in as a senator a few weeks ago in the opening fortnight of parliament. Stacey confirmed his resignation in a phone call with Guardian Australia. Sussan Ley says all Australians should be ‘very sad’ about state of relationship with Israel Opposition leader Sussan Ley was just asked about Israel’s decision to revoke some visas for Australians to the Palestinian Authority. Ley said she really regrets “the way that the relationship between the Albanese government and the government of Israel is deteriorating”. She told the press in Sydney: That is something all Australians should be very sad about today. Israel is a liberal democracy in the Middle East and we should be supporting them as that liberal democracy and the steps that the Albanese government has taken over recent days and weeks certainly have not demonstrated that. This is an elected member of the Israeli parliament and it’s a very unusual thing to refuse a visa and I haven’t seen explanations from Tony Burke that actually explain what is going on here. The politician in question, Simcha Rothman, is a far-right member of Israel’s parliament. He has described Palestinian children in Gaza as “enemies” and called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank. Oh, the table is oval The roundtable – which is actually occurring around the long oval table of the cabinet room – today features the likes of the NSW treasurer, Daniel Mookhey, the independent MP Allegra Spender, the secretaries of key government departments, unions bosses Sally McManus and Michele O’Neil, business leaders Innes Willox and Andrew McKellar and the RBA chief, Michelle Bullock. Sitting on the far rounded edge of the cabinet table – as far from Albanese as would be possible – is the Liberal deputy leader and shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien. Behind closed doors, roundtable begins in earnest The economic roundtable has gone behind closed doors in the cabinet room, so we’re left to wait and wonder what’s going on in there. As we leave the boffins to their discussions, one person joked to us this morning that it was like a papal conclave – doors sealed, onlookers anticipating outside waiting for smoke signals to emerge. We managed to nip inside the cabinet room earlier as Albanese and Chalmers made their opening addresses. The prime minister said he didn’t expect the assembled participants to agree on every issue (with the unions, business groups, environment leaders and politicians in one room, it’s probably hard to agree on the lunch order, let alone the future economic direction of the country), joking that he would be shocked if they reached a settled consensus position on thorny topics like artificial intelligence this week. But in the spirit of consensus (a word you’re hearing a lot this week) Albanese invited all the roundtable members to drinks at the Lodge tomorrow night. We’ve been ushered out of the room by the PM’s media team, and while we leave the economic titans to their own devices, even the participants have not been left to their own (electronic) devices – phones, watches and other tech gear have had to be surrendered at the door. A few desks full of electronics were seen by the door of the cabinet room, held in little plastic boxes with each leader’s name on a sticky note. We hope there’s no mix-up on the way out, and that they’ve all since been turned to silent after one phone and watch started prominently buzzing just moments into the three-day meeting, a deafening ringtone interrupting Chalmers’ opening address. Liberal MP Garth Hamilton proposed this morning Australia start paying migrants to go back to their home countries if they’re struggling to find work or a place to live. Hamilton spoke to 2GB to tout the idea, which has been implemented in a smattering of other countries. He said: The reality is, a lot of migrants who are coming over here, they aren’t finding work, they aren’t finding the housing, they aren’t finding that things were as rosy as they’d hoped because of the high immigration policies that we’ve employed. We have to address this, we have to address it now. We’re not going to build our way out of this problem All of this is trying to give people a pathway home. This is a cost that Australia is already bearing, either through welfare or the high rents that we’re paying because of the extra demand on housing in Australia. This is a cost that we’re just moving from one place to another. Greens add crossbenchers in Tasmania in ‘powerful position’ to work with Liberal premier Woodruff added that a strong crossbench in Tasmania had given the Greens and others the ability to deliver “great legislative reforms”, saying she had had good conversations with Jeremy Rockliff about ways parliament could operate in a more sustainable way moving forward. She told RN Breakfast: I have had a commitment from Jeremy Rockliff that he will work in good faith and also wants to have those same mechanisms put in place. So it’s not our intention to do anything except to work hard for four years and get change for the people of Tasmania. Tasmanian Greens say conversations with Labor went nowhere in attempt to form minority government The Tasmanian Greens leader, Rosalie Woodruff, said Labor leader Dean Winter “refused” to make any compromises, explaining her party’s decision not to back another vote of no-confidence in Liberal premier Jeremy Rockliff as parliament returns today. Woodruff spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, saying she had been talking seriously with Labor as Winter sought to form a minority government with the crossbench after the state’s snap election. But she said her conversations with Rockliff allowed the Greens to talk about “the problems we’d had with him and his government over the last 11 years and the deep concerns that we still have about what the Liberals have been doing to the budget and to the environment in Tasmania.” She went on: We have had some sit-down, long conversations multiple times with Dean Winter and really tried to get some policy changes from them, some compromises really. … We were looking for some way forward, some changes at all. But Dean Winter and Labor refused to make any compromises on their policy positions before going back to parliament. …That wasn’t good enough. We tried really hard in good faith, but Dean Winter hasn’t shown any capacity or ability or intention to make any changes for the people who voted for us. … James Paterson, the shadow finance minister, said the Coalition would be open to a contribution to a peacekeeping effort to Ukraine, a shift from a stance from the former opposition leader Peter Dutton who described any involvement as a “thought bubble by the prime minister”. Paterson spoke to ABC News as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in Washington to meet with Donald Trump: It’s very clear if there’s to be a durable peace, that security guarantees for Ukraine are going to be necessary. Now, that would have to be led by the United States and European partners. But if Australia is invited to play a role in, that then we should consider whether we can make a constructive contribution to that. Paterson was asked about the potential for Australian peacekeepers to be sent to the region in a non-combat role. He said: We are clearly not a central player in this conflict but we do have a very strong interest in making sure this isn’t just a pause in Vladimir Putin’s war that’s resumed at a later date. We want it to be long-lasting. So we should consider any request from our allies and friends in Europe as to if we can make a symbolic contribution towards this. Very clearly the heavy lifting would be done by Nato in this instance. But we are a partner of Nato and if we’re asked to make a contribution, we should consider it. Lone opposition member at roundtable says he will be constructive and critical The opposition’s sole representative at the economic reform roundtable, the shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, lashed Labor for being too slow to act on falling living standards in Australia. Speaking before the summit began on Tuesday, O’Brien said Chalmers needs to do more to help households: He has set himself the biggest test since he has entered parliament. He has made it very clear to the Australian people that he will turn the stats around on living standards. Australia has experienced the biggest decline in living standards of all developed nations as a direct consequence of this government’s actions. I see my role as representing the 27 million Australians who have been struggling under this Albanese government. I will, of course, be constructive where I can, and critical where I must. Chalmers tells attendees we need to do ‘more’ ‘better’ in call for ‘good ideas’ Jim Chalmers addressed attendees on the first day of the three-day economic reform roundtable, riffing on how well the economy is going under Labor: a rate cut last week, inflation down, unemployment low and real wages growing. But, naturally, our hyperactive treasurer is not satisfied: Australia’s performance, in many ways, does set us apart, but we’re not satisfied with that. We need to do more, and we need to do better, and we will do better, and that’s what this is all about. He repeats his “three days to inform three budgets” line, which is his new favourite, alongside old faves like “churn and change”. Speaking to the people in the room he said: “Now to make the most of this opportunity, we need your concrete ideas”. We need you to be specific. We need you to suggest ways to pay for them so that good ideas are also affordable ideas. We need you to be willing to test your ideas with others in the room. We need you to be able to find common ground and recognise that sometimes that involves compromises, because this is all about building consensus, and it’s all about building momentum, which means going beyond our own narrower sectional or commercial interests and serving the national economic interest. Anthony Albanese has officially opened the government’s economic reform roundtable in Canberra in the past few minutes. There’s about 30 people squashed into the cabinet room for the start of the three-day summit, set to be overseen by the treasurer, Jim Chalmers. Albanese says some of the proposals coming out of the summit could be considered for this year’s mid-year budget update, due in December, and next May’s federal budget. The prime minister said some of the agenda items for the summit – including AI – won’t be solved immediately: Even though this won’t be broadcast live, [because of] the nature of the cabinet room, the ideas that have been generated already will be the subject of the discussions. One of the things I’ve said is that we are focused on delivery and getting things done, but how things are done are also important. Albanese said the national interest should override sectional interest during the discussions. “My government is focused on looking after people on the economic journey,” he said. Some scenes from Canberra with the productivity roundtable about to begin The economic reform summit is about to begin, and while parliament house isn’t exactly abuzz, there is a quiet hum going through the building. With all the formal activities happening in private in the cabinet room and therefore off-limits to your humble correspondent (aside from a few selected remarks from the prime minister and treasurer to be broadcast on TV), we’re reduced to loitering around outside the ministerial wing. Sadly there no bunting, flags or paraphernalia for the summit that we can see – a quick wander past the cabinet room area earlier showed a few privacy screens and some information signs, but little else in the way of journalistic colour. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan was drinking a coffee at Aussies cafe earlier, in a black T-shirt emblazoned with the phrase “energy prices are the real productivity issue”. He joked to us that he was holding his own roundtable later today. A delivery rider in inner Sydney was hospitalised last night after he was allegedly knocked off his bike and stabbed multiple times with a screwdriver, police say. NSW police said the man, 24, was riding through the Sydney suburb of Ultimo near the CBD around 9.15pm on Monday night. On arrival, police were told the rider was allegedly pushed to the ground by an unknown man, who later walked away after the alleged assault. The 24-year-old rider was treated at the scene by paramedics and taken to the hospital in a serious but stable condition. Officers have established a crime scene and begun an investigation. Opposition says visa tit-for-tat reflects worst Australia-Israel relations since the second world war The shadow finance minister, James Paterson, told the ABC this morning he believes the visa episode demonstrates “Australia’s bilateral relationship with Israel is the worst it has ever been since the creation of the state of Israel”. Paterson said he was not familiar with “all” of the views of far-right politician Simcha Rothman, who was denied a visa yesterday, but said barring any visiting lawmaker was a major decision. He questioned the move by the government in an interview on ABC News: It is a very big call to block the visa of a visiting member of parliament from other country. My question is did Tony Burke discuss the diplomatic implications of that visit with the foreign minister, Penny Wong? Did he discuss it with the prime minister? … This is not a decision to be taken lightly and the all the implications should have been considered and its not clear that occurred. Finance minister says government disappointed, but ‘not surprised’ after Israel revokes visas Finance minister Katy Gallagher said the government is disappointed after Israel revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority overnight. Gallagher said the Labor government was not surprised by the move, which came after Anthony Albanese said Australia would recognise a Palestinian state and after the country refused a visa yesterday for a far-right member of Israeli parliament. But Gallagher told RN Breakfast the episode reflected the need for more diplomacy between Australia and Israel: At a time when we need more diplomacy and more dialogue between countries, it is a disappointing decision. We’re not surprised necessarily by it. We saw similar steps taken against other countries … But certainly our view is this is unjustified and we need more talk, more diplomacy, more channels in for discussion than we’ve needed before. Grim statistics on suicide attempts amongst younger people Young people have attempted suicide without any previous suicidal ideation or planning, the Australian Institute of Family Sudies (AIFS) has found. “[That] can understandably be a shock for their families and friends,” AIFS’ senior survey manager, Agatha Faulkner, said. Data from the institute’s Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, which has tracked 10,000 children since 2004, was released on Tuesday. It shows 38% of females studied have suicidal thoughts and behaviours, compared to 31% of males. About one in eight males attempt suicide without ideation or planning when they are 14 or 15 years old, and about one in 10 females at 16 or 17 years old. Parental separation, financial stress, disability, depression and anxiety symptoms, and both being bullied and bullying others all had an effect. Suicide Prevention Australia’s chief executive officer, Nieves Murray, said: This research is a stark reminder that suicidal distress among young people can emerge suddenly and without warning. We must move beyond crisis-only responses and ensure support starts early, is consistent, and involves the whole community. • In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Children, young adults, parents and teachers can contact the Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800. A no-confidence motion from Labor against the Tasmanian Liberal premier, Jeremy Rockliff, is set to fail when parliament returns one month since the state election today. Rockliff was recommissioned as premier but the Labor leader, Dean Winter, planned to test his numbers in the parliament on Tuesday with a no-confidence motion. Neither the Liberals (14) or Labor (10) hold the required 18 seats for a majority, and there have been weeks of negotiations with the Greens and independent members to gain their support. Winter’s motion is set to fail with the Greens (holding 5 seats) announcing on Monday they were unable to back Winter after he refused to make policy concessions to the crossbench and repeatedly ruled out “doing a deal” with the Greens. The Greens stated their decision not to back Winter’s motion was not an endorsement of the Liberal government. The Liberals made policy concessions including a review of salmon farming and a ban on greyhound racing by 2029. Independent Kristie Johnston on Monday also said she was unable to support an “uncompromising” Labor. Fellow independent and former Labor leader David O’Byrne on Sunday threw his support behind Rockliff as premier. – with AAP Good morning, and happy Tuesday. Nick Visser here to take over for Martin Farrer. Let’s get into it. The shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, said the Coalition would enter this week’s economic reform roundtable seeking ideas to “stop the spending spree” and “growing the economic pie”. O’Brien will be one of the over two dozen to attend the roundtable this week and told ABC’s 7.30 program he saw his role as listening to the ideas put forward, as Treasurer Jim Chalmers intended to do, rather than put any forward, but said those two points were what the Coalition would go in for. Repeatedly pressed on whether a future Coalition government would raise the GST, O’Brien did not answer directly. On how the Coalition would pay for the proposed $21bn increase in defence spending over the next five years, O’Brien said he wasn’t announcing policy. He said the Coalition will approach the roundtable constructively where it can, and critical where it must. But the prism he views the proposals would be very different to that of the treasurer, he said. When it comes to tax reform, if the government is genuinely interested in dealing with the Coalition on tax reform to drive more efficiency into the system, then we’re up for that conversation. And so, happy to have that conversation. O’Brien would not say where any potential savings would come from, but pointed to the electric vehicle fringe benefit tax exemption, which the Coalition promised to axe at the last election amid Treasury forecasts it could cost half a billion dollars per year. Jim Chalmers has declared his “ambitious government” is ready to meet the great economic challenges of our time as he urged attendees at the opening of the three-day reform round table to set aside factional interests and work in the national interest. In draft speaking notes provided to Guardian Australia, the treasurer said it was incumbent on politicians, interest groups, unions, and experts to help build “a new generation of prosperity”. After 900 submissions and dozens of ministerial mini-roundtables over the past six weeks, Chalmers said “broadly, we’re looking to build consensus around three types of outcomes”. “Clear reform directions – areas where there’s momentum and broad agreement on the direction of travel even if unanimity isn’t there yet. “Specific reforms – the handful of changes we could all agree on now. “And ongoing priorities – where there’s appetite in the room for further work.” The first day will focus on “resilience” and will be opened by Anthony Albanese, who will deliver a brief address, followed by Chalmers and then the Reserve Bank’s governor, Michele Bullock. Today’s three sessions will take place behind closed doors in the cabinet room in parliament house and will cover issues such as international trade opportunities and how to develop and attract skilled workers and investment. Days two and three will be about productivity and budget resilience, respectively. Penny Wong has responded to Israel’s decision to revoke the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, calling it “unjustified”. In a statement released early this morning, Wong said: At a time when dialogue and diplomacy are needed more than ever, the Netanyahu government is isolating Israel and undermining international efforts towards peace and a two-state solution. This is an unjustified reaction, following Australia’s decision to recognise Palestine. We will continue to work with partners as we contribute international momentum to a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza and release of the hostages. Australia welcomes different races, religions and views, united by respect for each other’s humanity and for each other’s right to live in peace. We safeguard our communities and protect all Australians from hate and harm. The Australian government will always take decisive action against antisemitism. Palestinian Authority condemns Israel visa revocations The Palestinian Authority has condemned Israel’s move. In a post to social media, it said: The foreign ministry condemns the arbitrary decision of the occupation against Australian diplomats… considering it illegal and in contradiction with the Geneva conventions, international law, and international legitimacy resolutions that do not grant the occupying authority such powers. The ministry affirms that the state of Palestine does not recognise this decision and deals with Australian diplomats as representatives accredited to the state of Palestine, and stresses that such measures reflect Israeli arrogance and a state of political imbalance, and that they will only increase Australia’s and other countries’ determination to adhere to international law, the two-state solution, and the recognition of the state of Palestine to achieve peace. Relations between Australia and Israel have taken another turn for the worse amid a tit-for-tat diplomatic spat over visas. A week after Australia said it would recognise Palestinian statehood, the Albanese government yesterday refused a visa for a far-right member of Israel’s ruling coalition. Israel responded last night when the foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, announced that he revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority, citing Australia’s “unjustified refusal” to grant visas to Israeli figures and its intention to recognise Palestinian statehood. Having announced his decision via X, Sa’ar then followed that up with a Hebrew-language video message released by his office, according to the Times of Israel. In it, the minister said that “Australia is acting against Israel, Australia is persecuting Israel,” and that its move to bar individuals “must be understood in this context”. “And we will take additional measures,” Sa’ar adds. “To be continued.” More here: Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it’ll be Nick Visser with the main action. The Albanese government risks becoming embroiled in a worsening war of words with Israel after the government in Tel Aviv revoked the visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority in response to Canberra refusing a visa for a far-right Israeli MP. The Israeli foreign minister called Australia’s decision shameful and said more action would follow. We have more coming up, including the reaction of the Palestinian Authority which condemned the move as “arbitrary” and arrogant. Plus: it’s the first day of the government’s much-sizzled economic reform summit in Canberra, and we’ll bring you all the action as it happens. Stay tuned!
