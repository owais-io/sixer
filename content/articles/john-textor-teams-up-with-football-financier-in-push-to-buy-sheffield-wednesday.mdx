  John Textor teams up with football financier in push to buy Sheffield
  Wednesday

  John Textor has teamed up with the football financier Keith Harris in an
  attempt to buy Sheffield Wednesday. Harris, a former investment banker, has
  brokered takeovers at West Ham, Manchester City and Aston Villa and put
  together a consortium to buy Everton last year, although that bid was
  unsuccessful. Textor was granted exclusivity in his attempt to buy Everton
  through his investment vehicle, Eagle Football, but also failed to complete.
  The American was not working with Harris, but they got to know each other
  through the Englishman’s work for Sportsbank, which this year offered Textor
  £230m to buy 45% of Eagle. The multiclub operation owns Lyon, Botafogo, the
  Belgian club RWD Molenbeek and was the biggest shareholder at Crystal Palace
  until selling to Woody Johnson last month. Sportsbank, a group of investors
  from the United Arab Emirates and the US led by Zechariah Janjua and Navshir
  Jaffer, did not complete that deal, with Textor opting to float Eagle on the
  New York Stock Exchange. Sportsbank is not involved in the bid for Wednesday;
  Harris is working with Textor to source funding elsewhere. Wednesday are in a
  perilous situation. The owner, Dejphon Chansiri, has held talks with several
  potential buyers this summer and said in June that he had rejected an offer of
  £40m from an unknown American consortium, which is not connected to Textor.
  Chansiri’s asking price is thought to be closer to £100m. The players have
  been paid late in four of the past five months, but their salaries are up to
  date after Wednesday last week received a £2.7m solidarity payment from the
  Premier League. The second instalment is due in January. This week Wednesday
  will receive their monthly central distribution of £460,000 from the EFL, but
  short‑term problems remain. The North Stand at Hillsborough has not been
  granted a safety certificate so fans will have to be moved for their first
  home game of the season against Stoke on Saturday unless work is carried out
  in time. Money is so tight that some players paid for their own hotel room
  before the 2-1 defeat at Leicester on Sunday. As things stand, overnight stays
  will be rationed for the rest of the season, with day trips from Sheffield
  likely the norm when practical. Textor confirmed last week he was interested
  in Wednesday. Harris has been chair of the Football League, a board member of
  Wembley Stadium and a director at Everton.
