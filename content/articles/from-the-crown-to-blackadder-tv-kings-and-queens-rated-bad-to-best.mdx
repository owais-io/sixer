  Rejoice! For the historical fiction stork has descended from on high with
  another bundle of monarchical joy. King and Conqueror (BBC) – a hugely
  entertaining depiction of the events that led to the Battle of Hastings – is
  the latest addition to that most stately of small-screen genres: the royal
  drama. Heavy is the head that wears the crown, though! For the portrayal of
  any British royal – and here we have Harold II (James Norton) and Edward the
  Confessor (Eddie Marsan) – is subject to a set of unspoken rules, most of
  which apply to the circumference of the royal nostrils and vowels, all of
  which must expand to fill the space available and, where necessary, beyond.
  But which small-screen portrayals of British sovereigns deserve veneration?
  And which deserve banishment to the Tower? God save this lot (or not, as the
  case may be): The best Claire Foy as Elizabeth II in The Crown (2016-2019)
  Foy’s multi-award winning performance offered an exquisitely nuanced take on
  the rise of HRH, from tremulous young newlywed, gasping as centuries of
  tradition prepare to clamp her in a constitutional headlock, to unflappable
  monarch, her tiny, gloved hand steady on the nation’s rudder. Even as the
  queenly baton was passed on – first to Olivia Colman, then Imelda Staunton –
  it was Foy’s quiet, beautifully controlled study that remained The Crown’s
  crowning glory: the definitive portrayal of, if you will, The Ascent of Ma’am.
  Damian Lewis as Henry VIII in Wolf Hall (2015 &amp; 2024) Oh look, it’s
  brilliant Damian Lewis being brilliant again, whether barrelling around
  Hampton Court Palace like a bearded love-tank or smirking inscrutably at poor,
  doomed Thomas Cromwell (Mark Rylance) as his principles, perspicacity and
  waistline gradually melt into a gouty moral abyss. A complex portrait of the
  isolation and boredom of autocracy, this was a performance as muscular and
  layered as a Tudor turducken. Eddie Marsan as Edward the Confessor in King and
  Conqueror (2025) “Do you hear it?” he whispers, palms upturned and huge face
  raised beatifically to the rafters. And we do: it is the sound of heaven’s own
  brass section, heralding a performance of such exquisite, mesmerising
  strangeness, “one” is compelled to speak in terms of career bests while
  pointing solemnly at a vast neon sign that reads, simply, “Bafta”. Thus, we
  are blessed with scenes in which Marsan’s squat, oleaginous Edward chatters to
  “the saints”, wangs on about God, muffs kingly addresses, looks to mummy (a
  magnificently vicious Juliet Stevenson) for reassurance and generally poddles
  around like a pious 11th-century mole. Send him victorious! Miranda Richardson
  as Elizabeth I in Blackadder II (1986) “But surely the televisual depiction of
  royalty is no place for merriment,” you (a fool) cry. “It is a palace of
  solemnity, of august vowels and clenched patrician buttocks, by jove!” You are
  wrong. For here is one of TV’s greatest royal monsters; wrinkling her tiny
  nosy-wose at the faintest hint of dissent and greeting everything from
  practical jokes to executions with the same squealing, dazed wonderment; like
  a cartoon toddler that has been whacked over the head with a 16th-century
  frying pan and, inexplicably, quite liked it. Jared Harris as George VI in The
  Crown (2016-2017) It’s a testament to Harris’ extraordinary charisma that the
  actor was able to turn a role consisting almost solely of the direction “Int:
  Coughing” into one of the most touching and memorable of all small-screen
  monarchic portrayals. So here he is, peering rheumily out of a series of royal
  windows, porridge-y jowls wobbling with the combined burden of … [clears
  throat] … duty to his country … and [cough] … bloody Churchill. Not to mention
  his deep concern for his beloved, callow Elizabeth as he faces up to his own,
  tumour-hastened [Bafta-nominated splutter] mortality. The worst Jonathan Rhys
  Meyers as Henry VIII in The Tudors (2007-2010) He’s Henry the Eighth, he is.
  Alas, he is also Jonathan Rhys Meyers, a situation that would ultimately prove
  as devastating to the Tudor “brand” as dysentery. The means? Flagrant
  Irishness. Plus? Distressingly intense buttock work. See also: eyebrows,
  extended bouts of pouting, shouting “gnyaaaarr” in order to indicate
  vexation/gout and repeatedly smushing his chin into his chest while flaring
  his nostrils, like a horse that’s just been refused a divorce by Pope Clement
  VII. Carolyn Sadowska as Elizabeth II in The Women of Windsor (1992) A
  Canadian (heavy sigh) TV movie, here, that nudges its snout into the private
  lives of Lady Diana Spencer (depicted as a sobbing bouffant) and Sarah
  Ferguson (a horse shouting at a helicopter through a fence). Shonkiest of its
  uniformly risible performances/impersonations, however, is Sadowska’s The
  Queen, who glides through her bits like a concussed wig on castors.
  Highlights: staring expressionlessly at cutlery, mechanically stirring a
  visibly empty teacup and not moving her lips while speaking, thus ensuring her
  vowels remain locked in terminal combat (“So you’re fond of horses,
  Diaaannaaaeuuugh?”). David Threlfall as Prince Charles in Diana: Her True
  Story (1993) It was a dark day for drama and, indeed, logic, when the great
  David “Shameless” Threlfall agreed to participate in this rush-released
  adaptation of Andrew Morton’s bestselling biography. Nevertheless, here, for
  reasons best known to himself, he is; wincing in tweed, biting his lip and
  saying “ngggnn” in a window-rattling potboiler that recasts the House of
  Windsor as [needle scratch, crash zoom on startled corgi] the House of Gits.
  Cue much cufflink-twiddling and a persistent, pained grimace that is less
  “future King of England” and more “Aardman character with gingivitis”. Max
  Irons as Edward IV in The White Queen (2013) Forsooth, sirrah, with thy idle
  pouting and thy smouldering toplessness thou dost surely turn the Wars of the
  Roses into the “Wars of the Poses!” And lo, much vexation does ensue as Max
  “Son of Jeremy” Irons plays the 15th-century ruler in the manner of an
  ambulant sex-piñata, with protracted brooding sessions punctuated by the sort
  of explosive heritage boffing scenes in which there is clearly at least half a
  metre separating boffer and boffee’s woohoos. Highlights? No. Although there
  is a bit where he narrows his eyes and purrs, “I’m brave”. Which is something.
  Jane Alexander as Elizabeth II in William &amp; Catherine: A Royal Romance
  (2011) Bow ties spin in horror as the House of Windsor is reimagined as
  Chessington World of Sovereigns™ in a Hallmark TV movie of such thoroughgoing
  stupidity it seems unfair to point the sceptre of shame at a single, poorly
  wigged element. Still, needs must. So here is the otherwise excellent (and,
  indeed, Emmy-nominated for her recent guest role in Severance) Jane Alexander
  slumming it as QEII; a maddeningly peppy action-ma’am whose determination to
  “embrace this new world!” is conveyed via scenes in which she plays Wii
  Sports, nods along to hip-hop and says “Kanye West” in an accent that could
  skin a corgi. King &amp; Conqueror is on BBC One from 24 August in the UK and
  on SBS in Australia later in 2025 • This article was amended on 22 August
  2025. An earlier version said Harriet Walter appeared in King &amp; Conqueror
  as Edward the Confessor’s mother; in fact, this role was played by Juliet
  Stevenson.
