  Thank you to Gaby Hinsliff for the article on Bonnie Blue and the Channel 4
  documentary about her (Moral outrage over Bonnie Blue’s porn empire misses the
  point: this is hardcore economics, 5 August). I was only vaguely aware of her
  until this week when, recovering from surgery, I decided to binge-watch Bake
  Off: The Professionals – something light and fluffy. Yet each time I open the
  Channel 4 app, I am confronted by Bonnie Blue’s picture and the promotion of
  her extreme sexual behaviour. There is no attempt from the broadcaster to be
  subtle with the adult content. I complained, and received the following reply:
  “Many thanks for your feedback. The image and programme title are suitable for
  all audiences and have been complied in accordance with the Ofcom broadcasting
  code.” It is very concerning if the Ofcom code approves the promotion of this
  story of a woman selling her body for sex orgies to barely legal young men as
  “suitable for all audiences”, with no concern for the ability of the audience
  to process this highly complex and disturbing subject matter. I am also very
  concerned for the younger generations and their expectations of relationships.
  Louise Riches London • The uproar over the documentary 1000 Men and Me: The
  Bonnie Blue Story reveals a deeper cultural paradox. Bonnie Blue is not what
  feminism wants, but is she what a certain strand of feminism has produced? A
  kind of Frankenstein’s monster born not of misogyny, but of a
  hyper-individualistic, sex-positive ethos untethered from collective ethical
  critique. We are witnessing the culmination of a pseudo-feminist narrative
  that valorises personal sexual agency above almost all else, while bracketing
  the social meanings and consequences of that expression. In this logic, any
  questioning of “empowerment” becomes suspect, even as the spectacle becomes
  indistinguishable from the patriarchal pornographies it once sought to
  subvert. If we are to protect future generations from degrading and
  dehumanising content, we must reckon honestly with the ideologies and cultural
  mores that have allowed such extremes to flourish. Rev Simon Jones
  Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria • Gaby Hinsliff discusses the battle to control
  “barely legal” porn. Surely the bigger picture should be to win the war to get
  porn off the internet altogether. Have we as a society become so deadened that
  we accept online porn as a normalised thing? Alan Gent Cheadle, Greater
  Manchester • Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
  Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our
  letters section.
