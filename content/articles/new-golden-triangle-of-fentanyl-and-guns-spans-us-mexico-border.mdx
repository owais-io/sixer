  A new “golden triangle” of fentanyl and gun trafficking between Mexico and the
  US ties together the homicide and overdose crises of the two countries,
  according to a a new study. The triangle spans Baja California, Sinaloa and
  Sonora – the three states where almost all fentanyl seizures in Mexico take
  place – and connects to Arizona through a quieter part of the US-Mexico border
  that has become a hotspot for trafficking in both directions. The rise of
  fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, has swept away the old golden triangle of
  Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua, which for decades was the epicentre of heroin
  production in Mexico. Data from Mexico’s defence ministry spanning 1990 to
  2024 show that 92% of seized fentanyl powder was in Baja California, Sinaloa
  and Sonora, while the figure for fentanyl tablets was 96%. This overwhelming
  concentration of seizures could reflect the Sinaloa cartel’s dominance of
  fentanyl production and trafficking, thanks to access to chemical precursors
  through Pacific ports, economic integration across the border and “decades of
  experience”, said the new report by the Global Initiative against
  Transnational Organised Crime thinktank. But it could also reflect the focus
  of law enforcement efforts, with the Sinaloa cartel in the crosshairs of both
  US and Mexican authorities. There is a similar skew in seizures on the border
  itself, where according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, roughly
  half of the fentanyl seized entering the US is caught coming through ports of
  entry in Arizona, and much of the rest comes through California. In the other
  direction, Arizona’s role in gun trafficking has also soared in recent years,
  as was highlighted by the Mexican government’s lawsuit against five gun shops
  there. Between 1 January and 24 July last year, Arizona was the source of 57%
  of guns that were recovered in Mexico and traced to a purchase in the US less
  than a year earlier, which is a key indicator of whether a firearm was bought
  with the intent of trafficking. The prominence of the Arizona-Sonora border in
  both fentanyl and gun trafficking “underscores the linkages between the two
  markets”, said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, lead author of the report. It also links
  the epidemics of homicide and overdose deaths in two countries, through a
  vicious cycle in which revenues from drug sales in the US allow criminal
  groups to boost their firepower in Mexico. Mexico’s annual homicide rate is
  among the highest in the world, at 24 per 100,000. Roughly 70% of homicides in
  Mexico are perpetrated with a firearm – and more than two-thirds of firearms
  recovered from crime scenes and submitted to tracing were sourced from the US.
  But in the US, the annual overdose death rate is similarly high, at 21.5 per
  100,000 people. And the majority of overdose deaths are caused by fentanyl.
  Some states, like West Virginia, have overdose deaths rates on a level with
  the homicide rates of the most violent states in Mexico. “Narratives that
  [place] casualties and costs of the war on drugs predominantly in the Global
  South are inaccurate in the context of synthetic opioids and, in particular,
  fentanyl,” wrote the authors. “The result is a region, not just one country,
  with high levels of excess mortality.” Mexico has been under intense pressure
  to show that it is tackling fentanyl trafficking, with the Trump
  administration designating six Mexican organised crime groups – including the
  Sinaloa cartel – as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs). One thing the FTO
  designation could be used for is to prosecute individuals involved in firearms
  trafficking who demonstrably provide “material support” to such groups in
  Mexico. But for now, despite a recent fall in seizures of fentanyl on the
  border that both governments have celebrated as a sign their interventions are
  working, the situation in the US remains unchanged. “There’s no shortage or
  price changes reported [in the US],” said Farfán-Méndez. “And that suggests we
  don’t have any less fentanyl.”
