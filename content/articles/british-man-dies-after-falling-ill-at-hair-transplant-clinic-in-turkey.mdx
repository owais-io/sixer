  A British man has died after starting a hair transplant procedure in Istanbul.
  Martyn Latchman, 38, from Milton Keynes, who left a 16-year career in teaching
  last year to become a defence contractor, died last week after becoming unwell
  during the preparatory phase of the £1,500 procedure. The clinic involved, Dr
  Cinik in the Besikitas area of the city, whose former clients include the
  ex-England and Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand, said it was not
  known why Latchman fell ill. He was transferred to an intensive care ward in a
  nearby hospital but died later that day, the clinic confirmed. Turkish media
  said police had launched an investigation. Latchman’s body has since been
  flown to the UK. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said: “We are
  supporting the family of a British man who died in Turkey and are in contact
  with the local authorities.” Until last December, Latchman, originally from
  Bridgend in south Wales, had been the assistant headteacher at Goldington
  academy in Bedford, where he was also head of computer science, according to
  his LinkedIn profile. His online posts suggest he regularly ran and worked out
  at gyms. Latchman’s family and friends paid tribute to him on social media.
  Yashley Latchman posted a photograph of him working out with Martyn with the
  caption “Rest in Peace my brother”. He wrote: “You will forever be my source
  of inspiration and motivation. Thanks for everything. Will miss u loads.”
  Alain Latchman commented: “Yes Yashley very sad. Too young.” Dr Cinik’s
  website claims it has conducted more than 50,000 successful transplants. Its
  best known clients are international footballers. As well as Ferdinand, other
  former patients include the Croatian World Cup finalist Ivan Rakitić, the
  former France and Liverpool striker Djibril Cissé and the Brazilian World Cup
  winner Rivaldo. In a statement, the clinic said it was “deeply saddened” by
  Latchman’s death. It said he had a successful hair transplant last summer and
  had returned this year for a second procedure. The statement said: “Prior to
  the second operation, all necessary medical evaluations and tests (including
  blood work, chest X-ray, ECG, etc) were carried out thoroughly and without
  omission, just as they were during the first procedure. “These assessments
  were conducted under the supervision of an anaesthesiologist, and the patient
  was cleared for surgery. “However, before the hair transplant procedure began
  and during the preparatory phase, the patient unexpectedly became unwell for
  reasons that are still unknown. “Immediate medical intervention was provided,
  and he was urgently transferred to a fully equipped university hospital.
  Despite ongoing intensive care treatment throughout the day, the patient sadly
  passed away later that evening.” The statement added: “Our clinic is an
  experienced medical institution that has performed over 70,000 hair transplant
  procedures to date. “All relevant medical documentation related to this
  incident has been submitted to the appropriate authorities, and the matter is
  currently being investigated by judicial bodies.” It also denied reports in
  the Turkish media last week that Latchman died during the procedure or that
  the operation was interrupted. It added: “The incident occurred before the
  hair transplant procedure had begun. Due to the ongoing legal process and out
  of respect for the family’s privacy, no further details will be disclosed at
  this time.”
