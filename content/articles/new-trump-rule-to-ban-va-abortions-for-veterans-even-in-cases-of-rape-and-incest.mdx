  incest

  Doctors at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) would be barred from
  performing abortions, even in cases of rape and incest, under new rules
  proposed by the Trump administration. The draft regulations, which also forbid
  providers from counseling female veterans about terminating a pregnancy, have
  generated nearly 20,000 comments in the federal register from conservative
  activists, abortion rights supporters and female veterans, many of them
  survivors of sexual assault. “I am a veteran, a mother, and my abortion saved
  my life,” wrote Mary Dodson-Otten, a 41-year-old nurse and air force veteran
  who lives outside Atlanta, Georgia. Dodson-Otten told the Guardian she ended a
  pregnancy in her 20s after she got pregnant by an abusive boyfriend who was a
  fellow service member. Without the abortion, she said, “I don’t think I would
  have survived, whether it would have been him hurting me or me hurting me.”
  The rule proposed by the Trump administration has an exception that allows
  abortions to take place “when a physician certifies that the life of the
  mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term”. But abortion
  rights advocates said the exception was too limited. “Women are going to die,”
  predicted Caitlin Russell, a former US army captain who served two tours in
  Afghanistan and studies female veterans’ health at the University of
  Pennsylvania. She said the exception would force “a woman to lie in the
  hospital bed until that woman is on death’s door” and cited high-profile cases
  of women dying after being denied miscarriage care in states that have strict
  abortion bans. Sexual assault remains endemic in the military. About one in
  three women and one in 50 men respond “yes” when asked by their VA provider if
  they had been forced to endure sexual activity against their will while in
  uniform. Separate anonymous surveys have put the figure as high as two in
  three female veterans. VA researchers have also found one in three female
  veterans experience intimate partner violence, a rate far higher than women
  who never served in the military. Rita Graham, a former US army artillery
  officer and research director of the Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN),
  said the rules were “unsafe and cruel and strip our military community of
  their right to make their own healthcare decisions. “We fought for our
  freedoms and deserve the healthcare that comes with that,” she said. The
  availability of abortions is relatively new at VA. The agency has only
  provided them under limited circumstances since 2022, following a policy
  change implemented by the Biden administration after the supreme court ended
  the federal right to abortion in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health. In an emailed
  response to questions, the VA press secretary, Peter Kasperowicz, described
  the Biden administration’s policy as “politically motivated” and said it
  violated a 1992 law that forbade the agency from providing abortions “except
  for such care relating to a pregnancy that is complicated or in which the
  risks of complication are increased by a service-connected condition”. Legal
  experts say that law has been superseded. They note it also bans the VA from
  providing infertility and pregnancy care, which the agency continues to offer.
  The VA also characterized the change as a matter of patient safety, claiming
  the “infrequency” with which the VA has performed the procedure since the 2022
  policy was enacted had “raised safety concerns”. According to the agency,
  veterans and their beneficiaries have received only 140 abortions per year
  under the policy through the VA. Trump’s VA secretary, Doug Collins, is a
  staunch abortion opponent. As a congressman, he received an A+ rating from
  Susan B Anthony Pro-Life America and referred to the 1973 supreme court
  decision that established the right to abortion as “barely coherent”. Women
  are the fastest-growing group of military veterans, with a significant
  proportion of female veterans of reproductive age living in Florida, Georgia
  and Texas – states with near total abortion bans. The comment period for the
  proposed rules runs through 3 September. Democrats on Capitol Hill have
  proposed legislation that would overrule the regulations should they go into
  effect and establish the legal right for veterans and eligible dependents to
  receive abortion care, medication and counseling through the VA as a matter of
  law. The bill has little chance of passage given Republican control of
  Congress, however. When the VA introduced the proposed rule on 4 August,
  Republicans on the House veterans affairs committee, led by its chairman, Mike
  Bost of Illinois, released a joint statement praising the decision. “It’s
  simple,” they said. “Taxpayers do not want their hard-earned money spent on
  paying for abortions – and VA’s sole focus should always be providing
  service-connected health care and benefits to the veterans they serve.”
