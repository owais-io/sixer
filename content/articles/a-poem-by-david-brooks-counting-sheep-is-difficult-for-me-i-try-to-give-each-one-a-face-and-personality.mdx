  Counting Sheep by David Brooks I count to try to get myself to sleep the
  numbers backward from one hundred as someone told me was the way with sheep
  ninety-eight, ninety-seven, ninety-six… then if I reach zero, still backwardly
  begin to count forward again minus one, minus two, minus three … each
  exhalation a ewe or wether stepping from the exit planks, each one a whisper
  of breath across my tongue In a month, as I calculate, I’ll unload three
  thousand or so, in a year at least thirty, and in two my ghost shipment could
  at last be free but something always happens the numbers oscillate exits turn
  into boarding ramps the ships always depart for the sweltering days at the
  Equatorial, dry heat over the Gulf the acrid water washing the baking deck the
  sea-mad crew, the dying lambs the bodies sinking in the fleece-white wake On a
  good night I’ll count almost none or lose track after forty or so, my thoughts
  straying, or one or another of them wandering off to watch the kelp in the
  tide-flow On a bad night I’ll count four or five hundred and get no sleep at
  all I’m a longtime insomniac. Almost nightly I “count sheep”, though it’s more
  a case of counting breaths, as the poem suggests. Counting sheep is difficult
  for me. I live with rescued sheep and to me each sheep’s a face, a
  personality. I’ve tried to give each sheep I count a face and personality, but
  that’s exhausting. I can’t get beyond a dozen or so. The repetition of faces I
  know becomes too distracting. Then there’s the matter of point-of-view. To
  count sheep effectively they must pass a set point individually – follow a
  path single-file, say, or go one-by-one up or down a ramp. In the poem I’ve
  chosen the latter. I abhor live export; I want to save sheep from it. The ramp
  my sheep come down is an exit-ramp, before their ship departs. In effect I’m
  stealing sheep, each one an escapee. But it isn’t so easy. The sheep are
  trapped. Save one from export and you condemn him/her to slaughter anyway. At
  least with live export there’s a cruise first, though of course – again – it’s
  hardly like that. The voyage is a horror worse than any the Ancient Mariner
  experienced. And live export’s just an example. Count sheep any which way and
  you realise you’re both in an awful bind, trapped in the messy guts of the
  human mind. The ships depart regardless. Exits become boarding-ramps. Numbers
  seem to progress but in fact move backward. All these things are in the poem
  one way or another. The exhaustion and frustration (insomnia) of animal
  advocacy, the hopes dashed repeatedly. The way you must keep going, day after
  day, night after night. But also (“kelp in the wave-wash”) the glimmers of
  hope, of how things might be. Australian Poetry Month runs throughout August
  and includes festivals, events, workshops and a commissioned poem of the day
  brought to you by Red Room Poetry. Find out more here
