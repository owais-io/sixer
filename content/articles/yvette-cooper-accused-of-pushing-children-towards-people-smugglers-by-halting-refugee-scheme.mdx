  Yvette Cooper accused of pushing children towards people smugglers by halting
  refugee scheme

  Yvette Cooper has been accused of pushing children “into the arms of people
  smugglers” after halting a scheme allowing refugees to bring their families to
  the UK. The home secretary said the refugee family reunion route was at risk
  of being exploited and she would temporarily suspend new applications until
  tougher rules were introduced next year. People who have had their asylum
  claims accepted will instead have to apply through the standard family scheme,
  which applies to UK citizens who have to show they have a joint income of at
  least £29,000 a year before they are allowed to bring a partner to the UK.
  Keir Starmer’s government is under pressure over immigration after a summer of
  protests outside hotels used to house asylum seekers while their claims are
  being assessed. There has been a fivefold increase in the number of refugees’
  family members granted visas to come to the UK, from 4,300 in 2023 to 20,600
  in the year to this March. In a statement to the Commons, Cooper said people
  smugglers were exploiting the family scheme to promote dangerous Channel boat
  crossings to potential asylum seekers. “We need to address the immediate
  pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family
  reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to boats,” she told MPs.
  “Therefore we are bringing forward new immigration rules this week to
  temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee
  family reunion route. Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be
  covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.”
  Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Until now,
  family reunion has been one of the only safe and legal routes available that
  allows refugees fleeing war and persecution to be reunited with their partner
  and children. “Far from stopping people taking dangerous journeys to cross the
  Channel, these changes will only push more desperate people into the arms of
  smugglers.” Critics have accused Cooper of hypocrisy, pointing out that in
  2021 she told the Commons: “If there are not safe legal routes for family
  reunion, we end up with more people driven into the hands of dangerous
  criminal gangs.” Gunes Kalkan, the head of campaigns at the children’s charity
  Safe Passage, said the change would have “disastrous consequences” for
  unaccompanied children trying to join their families in the UK. He added:
  “We’re talking about children from conflict and high human rights abuse areas,
  such as Afghanistan, Sudan and Iran, who have been torn apart from family in
  the chaos.” Mubeen Bhutta, the director of policy at British Red Cross, said:
  “Today’s announcement will separate families and cut off one of the only safe
  and managed routes for children to seek protection. The vast majority of
  people who use family reunion visas are children and women, often trapped in
  very dangerous situations.” Cooper told MPs that six years ago refugees who
  applied to bring family to the UK did so on average close to 18 months after
  they were granted protection, allowing applicants to find work. Applications
  now came in on average within a month, with some councils finding that more
  than a quarter of their family homelessness applications were linked to
  refugee family reunion, she said. Home Office figures show there were 20,817
  refugee family reunion visas issued in the year to June 2025, 93% of which
  were granted to children or women. More than half of the visas, 11,641, were
  issued to children. Two-thirds of visas were issued to nationals of five
  countries – Syria with 3,808, Iran 3,619, Afghanistan 2,569, Eritrea 1,963 and
  Sudan 1,804. Cooper suggested the new scheme could be modelled on those in
  Europe such as Denmark and Switzerland, where migrants have to wait two years
  before being allowed to reunite their families after being granted refugee
  status. The International Rescue Committee (IRC), the chief executive of which
  is the former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband, called the move “deeply
  alarming”. Flora Alexander, the IRC’s UK executive director, said: “Narrowing
  access for people seeking to reunite with loved ones is not a solution to
  system pressures; it risks pushing more people toward dangerous journeys and
  represents a step away from compassion and common sense.” Cooper also told
  MPs: Reforms to family reunion routes would be introduced to the Commons next
  month and become law in the spring. The first returns of rejected asylum
  seekers to France under a “one in, one out” deal would take place this month.
  She would set up a new independent body to process a backlog of immigration
  and asylum appeals. Earlier on Monday, Starmer said he wanted to speed up
  efforts to empty hotels housing people awaiting asylum decisions before the
  next election. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: “We’ve said we’ll get rid of them
  [asylum hotels] by the end of the parliament. I would like to bring that
  forward, I think it is a good challenge. I want to bring that forward.” The
  SNP MP Pete Wishart told MPs he thought the government was encouraging Reform
  UK by refusing to speak up for asylum seekers. “Doesn’t [Yvette Cooper]
  realise that every time she moves on to the ground of Reform, all she is doing
  is further encouraging and emboldening them?” he said. Cooper said she had
  spoken positively about asylum seekers. But she said the public wanted the
  asylum system to be “properly controlled and managed”. The government has
  committed to stop using hotels to house asylum seekers by the end of the
  parliament, which could be as late as 2029, but the prime minister suggested
  on Monday he wanted to “bring that forward”. Speaking to 5 Live, Starmer said
  he understood concerns about migration, describing it as a “really serious
  issue”. Asked to commit to a date to empty asylum hotels, he said: “Well,
  we’ve said we’ll get rid of them by the end of the parliament. I would like to
  bring that forward, I think it is a good challenge. I want to bring that
  forward.”
