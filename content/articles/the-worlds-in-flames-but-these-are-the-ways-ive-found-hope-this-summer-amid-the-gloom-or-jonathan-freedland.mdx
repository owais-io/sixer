  If you’ve locked your phone in a drawer, hidden the newspaper down the sofa or
  unplugged the radio, I wouldn’t blame you. Just glimpsing or half-hearing the
  headlines can be enough to plunge you into a sinkhole of gloom. If it’s not
  the Trump administration ending $500m worth of funding for the very vaccine
  programmes that helped rescue billions from the menace of Covid – as part of
  Robert F Kennedy Jr’s determined effort to rollback mass immunisation, one of
  the greatest gifts science has given humankind – it’s the ongoing agony of
  Gaza, only set to increase after Benjamin Netanyahu responded to a global
  outcry over his use of starvation as a weapon not by moving to increase the
  flow of humanitarian aid into the strip, as so desperately needed, but rather
  to escalate the war yet further, his security cabinet agreeing early Friday
  morning to take over Gaza City. If it’s not a climate crisis that sees heat
  records broken summer after summer, it’s the massacre in Sudan of more than
  1,500 civilians sheltering in a camp for displaced people, the attack
  conducted over 72 bloody hours by paramilitaries backed by the United Arab
  Emirates, a western ally. Or it’s the steady breakdown of tolerance that had
  held, imperfectly, for decades – witness those with loud megaphones who have
  been all but urging their followers to stage a repeat of last August’s
  violence in England and Northern Ireland directed at asylum seekers or the
  Spanish town that has banned the celebration of Muslim religious festivals in
  public spaces. The supply of bad news is voluminous and apparently without
  end. You lament what is happening now, with the proliferation of social media
  pumping out falsehood, whether AI-generated or human-made, and hate – and then
  you are reminded of our recent past. Wednesday marked 80 years to the day
  since an atomic bomb, surely one of the darkest bequests science has given
  humankind, took the lives of as many as 140,000 people in Hiroshima. All this
  could lead even a sane person to despair of their fellow human beings and what
  they are capable of. The urge is strong to run away, to turn off the news and
  escape. And yet that presents a new problem: guilt. When wars rage and
  innocents are slaughtered, it can feel selfish, even frivolous, to think about
  or pay attention to anything else. “Don’t look away,” urge those posting
  graphic horror on social media. Yet the need to look away, and to get away, is
  compelling, precisely because of the turmoil all around. Tentatively, I want
  to make a moral case for escapism, for allowing oneself a break from world
  events. Not on the therapeutic grounds of personal wellbeing and mental health
  – though those are surely obvious – but as an essential means of retaining our
  ability to see the world, and the people, around us. My own somewhat guilty
  pleasure this summer has been to follow the contest between the England and
  India cricket teams, which came to a thrilling climax on Monday. I appreciate
  that there will be some Guardian readers – and not only in the US – who will
  be poised to swipe, or turn, the page at the mere mention of the word cricket.
  But stay with me, because this is not a point about sport, but about life.
  Across five separate matches, each one played from morning till dusk for five
  straight days, these two sides of 11 men did battle with everything they had.
  It was a physically gruelling competition. The England captain, Ben Stokes,
  who looks as if he could have commanded a platoon of men in the trenches at
  the Somme, has a body that has been battered through years of relentless
  exertion. He is an all-rounder, both batter and bowler, which , combined with
  his leadership duties, means he scarcely rests. After one of the five matches,
  he was confined to bed for four days. The third Test match was won at the
  death thanks to a ball delivered by England’s Shoaib Bashir. He managed to
  spin it in such a way that it confounded the opponent who faced it, and he did
  that despite nursing a broken finger. In the closing moments of the final
  match on Monday, England’s Chris Woakes walked out to the middle, apparently
  ready to face a hard, heavy cricket ball hurtling at him at a terrifying
  90mph, with one arm in a sling, his shoulder dislocated. When he ran, his face
  was a rictus of pain. In the end, England fell just short. It was an
  enthralling 25 days, sometimes played out in searing summer sun, sometimes
  interrupted by July rain. What we witnessed from both teams was a display of
  determination so extreme, it is rarely glimpsed outside the realms of violent
  fanaticism. There were moments of folly and failure, dropped catches and bad
  decisions, but these were athletes aiming for, and often reaching, the heights
  of true excellence. You didn’t have to be a fan of cricket to find the sight
  exhilarating. In the end the series was drawn, and perhaps that was oddly
  fitting. The teams had matched each other in their resolve not to be beaten.
  You could say the same of the Lionesses, the England women who got so close to
  defeat at the European football championships they all but found a seat for it
  on the team bus, but who never succumbed. Their commitment to succeeding, to
  being better, was riveting to see. But it’s not confined to sport. Watch the
  performances of Florence Hunt and Rory Walton-Smith, the two young leads in
  the BBC drama Mix Tape, and you see a perfect evocation of first love. Or you
  could read this week a touching account of what is surely a valedictory tour
  by the great Paul Simon. The author noted how Simon’s voice is no longer what
  it was, how “It’s lost its highs &amp; lows, stuck in a breathy mid-range.”
  The band on stage adjust accordingly, but “Simon is such an artist, so
  instinctively musical, he makes the most of the voice he’s got, wringing every
  little bit of feeling &amp; nuance out of it. You can see him working at it,
  just as obsessively committed to quality as ever.” That obsessive pursuit of
  excellence is the thread that runs through John &amp; Paul, Ian Leslie’s quite
  brilliant study of Lennon and McCartney and the enduring music each spurred
  the other to produce. It’s a reminder of what humans can do, the heights they
  can reach, the joy they can bring. None of it makes any of the other stuff go
  away. Trump is still there when the Test match ends; death still stalks Gaza
  when you close Leslie’s book. But it is a useful antidote all the same. No,
  not useful – essential. For it’s when we feel ourselves plunged into the
  abyss, when our despair at our fellow human beings pulls strongest, that we
  most need to look upward – and glimpse the stars. Jonathan Freedland is a
