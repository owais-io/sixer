  Our friend Helen (the person who encouraged me to write a first speculative
  Guardian diary 39 years ago) suddenly announced: “I see a stoat.” It would be
  the year’s first. I was anxious not to miss a glimpse, which is as much as you
  usually enjoy, because stoats move like eels and evaporate like smoke. Not
  this one. A limestone wall through ancient sheep pasture seemed to have a
  magnetic hold over its movements. He rippled across the capstones like water,
  until he transferred attention to a feeding flock of tits that gathered,
  chattering with alarm at a possible predator. The stoat then did something
  I’ve never seen before. He fired himself into an old elder and clambered
  midway up the tree. Next he scampered through the lower branches, converting
  the linear maths of so many outstretched limbs to a series of ellipses and
  spheres. Round and round he corkscrewed, at times apparently upside down and
  so quickly you could not possibly trace the manoeuvres, but gravity barely
  seemed to be involved and the liquid flow of his body more resembled flight
  than fleetness of foot. There was one extraordinary moment when he appeared to
  need an intermission from all the ecstasy. He dropped to the wall, found a
  mossy niche in which to slot himself and rolled over with lemony breast
  uppermost, head and neck draped downwards so that he could see the human
  observers, but upside down. In this extravagant posture, like any lounge
  lizard on his divan, he wriggled his back, perhaps to mark scent or satisfy an
  itch. Those eternal 10 seconds of inaction were quite enough. Off he skipped,
  back into the tree, through the branches, down to earth, along the length of
  the wall, far over the field until we could see him on a bent-back ash trunk:
  a distant dancing silhouette. Surely that was it? But back he rushed, peeping
  from elevated points along the wall, like a chatelain on his ramparts, where
  he came face to face with Helen (now trying to record the moment). A second to
  assess whether she was prey or predator and off he tricked, as light as seed
  floss, black-tipped tail upright, flickering as he departed. • Under the
