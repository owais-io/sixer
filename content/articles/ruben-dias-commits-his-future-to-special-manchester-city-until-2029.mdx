  Rúben Dias has signed a two-year contract extension with Manchester City that
  keeps him at the club until 2029, with the central defender saying he
  “couldn’t imagine playing anywhere else”. Since signing for City from Benfica
  in September 2020 for £62m, Dias has claimed 10 trophies under Pep Guardiola
  and was a key member of the team that won the treble in 2023. In all he has
  played 223 times for the club, has 68 Portugal caps and was the Football
  Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year in his debut season in England.
  “My job now is to be the best I can be for the duration of this contract, so
  that I can play my part in helping us challenge for more silverware,” said the
  28-year-old. “I want to thank my teammates, Pep, Hugo [Viana, City’s sporting
  director], the coaching staff and everyone at the club. This is such a special
  place, and I am grateful every single day for the support I receive. Now the
  hard work begins, and I want to promise the fans that I will give everything
  to win more trophies and bring more success to City. “I love Manchester – it
  is my home now – and I love the Manchester City fans,” added Dias. “Their
  support from day one has been absolutely unbelievable, and I appreciate them a
  lot. When I think about the trophies we have won and the way we have played
  our football during my time, I couldn’t imagine playing anywhere else.”
