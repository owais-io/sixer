  For the first time in the US, an identical twin has been convicted of a crime
  based on DNA analysis. On 21 August, a jury found Russell Marubbio, 54, guilty
  of a sexual assault that occurred in Woodbridge, Virginia, in 1987.
  Virginia-based Parabon NanoLabs ran an analysis on the DNA sample found at the
  scene nearly four decades ago. Genealogist CeCe Moore then traced the
  perpetrator’s family tree and seemed to hit a wall when the sample led to
  identical twins. Usually, that would be the end of using DNA to solve the
  case. Identical twins have the same DNA – almost. There are sometimes a few
  cells that split and evolve differently. “On average, twins will have eight of
  those types of differences across the whole 3 billion bases” of the genome,
  said Ellen Greytak, the director of bioinformatics at Parabon. The scientists
  were able to detect some of these mutations in the sample, compared to cheek
  swabs from the Marubbio brothers, leading to the conviction on Friday. “This
  landmark case marks the first successful admission and application of this
  specific technique in a US court to overcome challenges in DNA identification
  of identical twins,” Amy Ashworth, the commonwealth’s attorney for Prince
  William county, Virginia, wrote in a statement. On 19 December 1987, a
  50-year-old cashier at a Chevron gas station in Woodbridge, took a bathroom
  break and was followed by a young man. He restrained her and sexually
  assaulted her at knifepoint. The assailant left semen at the crime scene, but
  his DNA never matched with any offenders listed in the law enforcement
  database known as the Combined DNA Index System (Codis). In 2019, Giannina
  Pinedo, a master detective with 22 years of experience, transferred to the
  cold case unit in Prince William county. She began looking through unsolved
  cases where DNA samples were present at the crime scene, alongside Colleen
  Grantham, another master detective with 23 years of experience. Scientific and
  technological advances in DNA sequencing and genealogical databases are now
  yielding breakthroughs in cases that long ago went cold. The Golden State
  Killer, for example, was arrested in 2018 after genetic genealogy led to a
  suspect, Joseph James DeAngelo, who pleaded guilty in 2020. The two Virginia
  detectives worked with several labs in different states. They submitted the
  DNA evidence to Parabon in August 2022. The company put together a sketch,
  based on genetics, of what the perpetrator might look like – and Moore, their
  chief genetic genealogist, tracked down possible suspects. The detectives
  worked with special agents in Florida, where the Marubbio twins lived, to
  obtain cheek swabs from the brothers for genetic sequencing. Parabon
  scientists then did whole-genome sequencing to uncover the smallest genetic
  differences between the men. “These are somatic mutations,” said Claire Glynn,
  a professor and the executive director of the Henry C Lee college of criminal
  justice and forensic sciences at the University of New Haven. “A better word,
  I think, for the public is acquired mutations, where you can differentiate
  between identical twins.” She thinks of it as similar to punctuation in a
  sentence. The “words” don’t change – the arrangements of A, T, G and C are the
  same in both twins – but sometimes there are commas in one sample where
  another has periods. “We would see the mutations from very early on in life,”
  Glynn said. They develop in utero, after the embryo splits in two. “In terms
  of the science, that’s well studied and well understood,” she said. “The
  science behind it is absolutely robust. It’s simply that it’s not that common
  that we would encounter this in cases.” There was a case in Massachusetts in
  2017 where a similar analysis was performed, but the judge on that case said
  the evidence was not admissible. In 2022, an identical twin was convicted of
  sexual assault in the Netherlands using similar genetic analysis. The rare
  genetic differences between identical twins may not show up at every place in
  the genome, Parabon’s Greytak said. “Only certain cells in the twin will have
  that mutation and other cells won’t. So they’re like a mosaic.” The scientists
  employed “ultra-deep sequencing”, looking for any differences in the twins’
  samples, Greytak said. “It’s really a small amount, but it’s a very
  distinctive, clear difference.” Those differences matched with the semen
  sample left at the crime scene, and Marubbio was convicted of violent
  abduction and rape. “Occasionally, you get these identical twin defense cases.
  And it used to be, they would give up,” said David Kaye, a professor emeritus
  of law at Arizona State University. “They would say: ‘Well, all right, the DNA
  is not going to help us.’ Now, it is possible, and it will.” Commercial
  genealogy has also expanded rapidly in recent years with the advent of
  inexpensive home testing and online databases. Law enforcement are permitted
  to search two databases, GEDMatch and FamilyTreeDNA, only among users who have
  opted into law enforcement use. In this case, Moore traced two second cousins
  back to a common ancestor in the 1860s, and then built a family tree forward.
  “Two of our matches were second cousins once removed to each other, and that’s
  really optimal for us. If someone is related, but not too related, it points
  to just one branch of their family tree that we need to look at,” she said.
  Moore hit an early snag when none of the people in one branch seemed to match;
  eventually, she realized that one of the matches had accidentally switched
  their DNA kit with their spouse. “When we looked at the spouse’s tree, that’s
  where we found the connection right away. It jumped out at us,” Moore said.
  She also looked at geographic location – someone who was reasonably close to
  the scene of the crime. Investigative genealogists will search for a host of
  records: birth, death, and marriage certificates; census entries; information
  from graveyards; newspaper clippings. In this case, Moore said: “We were able
  to find some very compelling information in high school yearbooks.” Once
  possible suspects are identified, genealogists like Moore can inform
  detectives of the lead. “It’s what I call a highly scientific tip,” Moore
  said. “They still have to do their full investigation, their due diligence,
  just like they would if I called the tip into Crime Stoppers.” Forensic
  investigative genetic genealogy, or Figg, “gets us to a potential person of
  interest”, Glynn said. Sometimes law enforcement will then collect DNA from
  the suspect surreptitiously – looking through trash, if local laws allow it;
  collecting dishes or utensils from restaurants; locating discarded coffee cups
  or cigarettes. If those samples match the crime scene DNA, then detectives
  move forward with the case. That often involves an arrest and a cheek swab to
  see if that sample also matches. The number of identical twins is “higher than
  people usually think”, Kaye said. “It’s not a common situation in the criminal
  investigative area, but it certainly occurs. So I would expect there would be
  more cases,” where analyses like these are performed to differentiate
  identical twins. And identical twins are “increasingly common because of
  fertility treatments”, Moore said. Understanding the genetic differences
  between identical twins has long been a goal of researchers, Glynn said. With
  the Marubbio analysis, “to actually have it used in court and have it accepted
  by the judge is a huge step forward”, Moore said. These kinds of analyses are
  becoming more common in cold cases as well as active cases, and more law
  enforcement are being trained on conducting genealogical research, Glynn said.
  The process can be expensive – especially when the crime-scene samples were
  heavily degraded by time or the environment. “But it can also be moderately
  cost effective,” Glynn said, especially compared to the resources spent on
  cold cases that stretch over decades. “If we invest and spend the money on
  these advanced methods that then identify and allow us to apprehend
  perpetrators of violent crimes, the impact on society – you can’t put a value
  on that, because if a violent serial offender is apprehended, no further
  people can be harmed,” she said.
