  Donald Trump’s imperial tendencies see the US president wield tariffs and
  sanctions in the expectation that America will receive tributes. Yet his
  latest move – punishing India with 50% tariffs for Russian oil purchases once
  encouraged by the US – has produced not submission but spectacle. It has sent
  India’s Narendra Modi to China for the first time in seven years as Xi Jinping
  hosted more than 20 leaders for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
  summit in Tianjin. And it is in Tianjin, not Washington, where it looks as if
  the hinge of history is moving. The SCO is easy to dismiss: the bloc is a
  bundle of contradictions. India and Pakistan remain adversaries. China and
  India still stare across a garrisoned Himalayan frontier, though relations
  have thawed since last October’s border breakthrough. Russia and China vie for
  influence in Central Asia. Unlike Nato, the SCO has no binding defence
  commitments. For much of its life, it has looked like a paper tiger, sending
  out communiques that were all roar and no bite. But in geopolitics,
  appearances are important. To see Mr Modi, Mr Xi and Vladimir Putin smiling
  and joking is to watch Washington’s influence fade. Mr Trump’s tariff
  broadside against India makes Tianjin significant. Here was the prime minister
  of India – supposedly the US’s Asian counterweight to China – affirming that
  New Delhi and Beijing are “partners, not rivals”. India’s calculation is
  straightforward. It has red lines: agriculture will not be opened up to US
  demands; oil purchases cannot be determined by Washington; the ceasefire with
  Pakistan was conceded by Islamabad, not brokered by Mr Trump. Backing down
  would look like weakness. Far better, from Mr Modi’s perspective, to
  demonstrate that the US cannot take India’s partnership for granted, and to
  seek friends elsewhere. For China, the rewards are immediate. Mr Trump has
  given Mr Xi a stage on which to pose as the host of an important multipolar
  gathering. Cai Qi, Mr Xi’s chief of staff and a member of China’s top ruling
  body – the first to hold both roles since Mao’s era – was dispatched to meet
  Mr Modi, an unmistakable gesture of intimacy from China’s rulers. Beijing sees
  the SCO as emphasising the US’s absence and letting others seize the stage.
  The implications stretch well beyond South Asia. For Moscow, every handshake
  in Tianjin underlines that sanctions have not made it a pariah. For Turkey,
  attendance preserves its ambiguity as a Nato member. For Iran, the SCO
  condemned the US-Israeli attacks it suffered this summer. The more this
  theatre normalises China and Russia as leaders of a non-western bloc, the
  harder it becomes for Washington to muster global consensus – notably over
  Ukraine – in future crises. Nor was Tianjin just about Eurasia. A spat with
  the Philippines over Taiwan on the eve of the summit reminded delegates of
  China’s reddest lines. The SCO claims it is inclusive. But Beijing runs the
  show. Mr Trump sought a kowtow from Delhi. Instead, he has handed Beijing the
  platform for its long game – building a system beyond the reach of the US.
  Whether that would allow more room for other states to manoeuvre is moot. The
  SCO may never fight China’s wars, but it ensures Beijing will never stand
  alone. That is the high price the west may end up paying for Mr Trump’s
  narcissistic delusions.
