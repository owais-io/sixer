  A support worker with a false identity who left a vulnerable 14-year-old girl
  unwatched in a secure psychiatric ward during his first shift had never worked
  in a hospital before, the teenager’s inquest has heard. Following the death of
  Ruth Szymankiewicz, police found the support worker had “stolen” the false
  identity, had a fake passport and was able to get the shift at the hospital
  through an agency after brief training. CCTV footage played to the inquest
  jury on Tuesday appeared to show Ruth going into her room at Huntercombe
  hospital in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and closing the door, though she was
  supposed to be under 1:1 observation. The footage suggested Ruth was left
  alone and unobserved in her room for 15 minutes. There was no sign of the
  support worker. While in her room, Ruth is believed to have carried out an act
  of self-harm that led to her death. After 15 minutes another staff member went
  into her room and raised the alarm. Sgt Francesca Keen of Thames Valley police
  told the inquest that the support worker tasked with watching Ruth at that
  time arrived in the UK about three months before and stole the name Ebo
  Acheampong from a “completely innocent man”. He signed up with a healthcare
  recruitment agency called Platinum. Keen said: “They felt they had checked his
  ID and were dealing with a legitimate person.” The inquest heard his training
  consisted of a day or day-and-a-half course, much of which was e-learning. The
  day after completing his training, he was given what Keen said was his “first
  and only shift” at Huntercombe and in the evening was put in charge of
  watching Ruth, who had a serious eating disorder. Keen was asked if there was
  anything to suggest he had worked at any other hospital before. She replied:
  “No.” The officer said the worker had claimed he left Ruth alone to help with
  another emergency nearby. But the CCTV footage played in court showed no
  evidence of this. Five days later, the man flew from the UK to Ghana via
  Heathrow. The officer said police now knew his true identity but did not have
  evidence to charge him and he could not be extradited. Ruth’s parents, Kate
  and Mark Szymankiewicz, a GP and a consultant surgeon, have strongly
  criticised the standard of care at Huntercombe, which was run by the company
  Active Care Group and has now closed. They are also critical that Ruth was
  being detained more than 70 miles from their home in Wiltshire. In a statement
  read out in court, Mark Szymankiewicz said he felt Ruth was “in limbo” –
  Huntercombe was not an appropriate place for her but there was nowhere else
  for her to go. The jury heard an extract from Ruth’s notebook in which she
  claimed there was “non-existent” therapy at the hospital and said staff slept
  on their shift. She described it as the “shittest mental institution”. Ruth’s
  parents are concerned she had unchecked access to her mobile phone. The
  inquest was told that in the weeks before her death she did research on
  methods of suicide and how many calories were in food including eggs, slices
  of toast and cereal. The hearing at Buckinghamshire coroner’s court continues.
