  Ministers have lined up special managers to run Liberty Steel’s South
  Yorkshire operations if they are put into administration, according to a
  revelation at the high court in London. The development shows that the
  government is ready to step in immediately to secure the continued operations
  of the Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), which employs 1,450 people at the group’s
  operations in Rotherham and in Stocksbridge. The fate of the steelworks could
  be decided as soon as this week. SSUK’s creditors are seeking a compulsory
  winding-up order, the high court heard on Wednesday. The company asked to
  adjourn the hearing to buy time to try to agree a “pre-pack” administration
  that would allow its owner, the metals tycoon Sanjeev Gupta, to keep control
  of the insolvent company. The Guardian last month revealed that the UK
  government was considering options to step in should SSUK fall into
  liquidation. It would be the second government intervention in the steel
  industry this year, after it took control of British Steel’s Scunthorpe plant,
  fearing that its Chinese owners would let the blast furnaces cool beyond
  repair. At the hearing in London, counsel representing the creditors showed
  the judge a letter from the Department for Business and Trade which said the
  government’s official receiver was ready to carry out a sales process if the
  company entered administration. The insolvency and companies court judge,
  Sally Barber, initially said she was minded to give two weeks of extra time to
  decide what the consequences of each course would be. However, after a short
  break, the creditors’ counsel, Ryan Perkins, of South Square chambers,
  disclosed that lawyers for the government were present in the court. The
  barrister said he had just been informed that an application for the
  appointment of a special manager to carry out the administration had already
  been filed. The judge referred the case to another court to decide in parallel
  whether to grant the application for a special manager and whether the company
  should be wound up immediately. That decision means that the steelworks will
  probably either enter a government-handled administration, or remain in
  Gupta’s control through the pre-pack deal, as soon as this week. Judge Barber
  said: “In the absence of some certainty, there is too much at stake for the
  court to shoot blind.” Gupta has been scrambling to find new financing for his
  businesses since the collapse in 2021 of Greensill Capital, which had lent the
  Gupta Family Group (GFG) Alliance about $4.5bn (£3.3bn). Administrators for
  Greensill are trying to recover that money on behalf of creditors, represented
  by the investment bank Citibank, which are owed £233m. The winding-up petition
  was originally brought by an equipment supplier in October but SSUK had been
  granted several adjournments to look for new investment. Fundraising efforts
  have been complicated by an investigation into GFG Alliance by the UK’s
  Serious Fraud Office for suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money
  laundering. At the same time, the steel industry has been hit by the turmoil
  caused by the coronavirus pandemic, followed by a glut of metal produced by
  Chinese companies. SSUK usually supplies aerospace and defence companies such
  as Rolls-Royce and Airbus. However, workers in South Yorkshire have dealt with
  years of uncertainty, as work at the plants has wound down. SSUK lost £340m in
  four years, and only has £650,000 in its bank account, according to figures
  revealed during the court process. The Rotherham plant and a similar operation
  in Motherwell, Scotland, have not produced any steel for about a year because
  of a lack of working capital to buy materials. However, workers’ salaries have
  continued to be paid. The court heard that Gupta wanted to buy the company
  back out of insolvency with money borrowed from BlackRock, the world’s biggest
  investment manager, with the consultancy Begbies Traynor preparing a pre-pack
  administration that would cut the company’s debts. Counsel for the creditors
  argued that standard liquidation would be “value-destructive” for the
  business. The creditors opposed the plan, arguing that they would prefer a
  sale via a government-controlled liquidation. “All the creditors here in court
  have had enough,” said Perkins, for the creditors. A Liberty Steel
  spokesperson said: “Liberty’s shareholder [Gupta] has invested nearly £200m,
  recognising the vital role steel plays in supplying the UK’s strategic
  defence, aerospace and energy industries. “We continue to believe our
  commercial solution backed by major private capital provides the best outcome
  for the business, its employees and all stakeholders concerned without cost to
  UK taxpayers or unnecessary uncertainty.” A government spokesperson said: “We
  continue to closely monitor developments around Liberty Steel, including any
  public hearings, which are a matter for the company. “We are supporting the
  official receiver so that they are prepared to take the necessary steps should
  the company enter into compulsory liquidation.” • This article was amended on
  22 August 2025. An earlier version said Citibank was owed £233m after the
  collapse of Greensill Capital; however, Citibank are representing creditors
  owed that money.
