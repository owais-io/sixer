  The song that changed my life My mom was Kate McGarrigle, who formed folk duo
  Kate and Anna McGarrigle with my aunt. My dad is the folk singer Loudon
  Wainwright III. They were only married for five years, but wrote songs about
  each other and about my older brother Rufus and I. My dad wrote Five Years Old
  about missing my fifth birthday. That changed my life. Sometimes it’s easier
  to apologise in music than in person. The song I can no longer listen to
  Recently, I’m upset that I can’t listen to Fast Car by Tracy Chapman, because
  the Luke Combs country version has ruined it for me. The first song I fell in
  love with When I was eight, I had my mom write out the lyrics to Walking on
  Sunshine by Katrina and the Waves so I could listen to it on repeat on this
  little boombox in our house and learn all the words. The song I’d like played
  at my funeral I’ve been learning The Kiss by Judee Sill. She was a remarkable
  artist, and it is considered her masterpiece. It is absolutely gorgeous, but
  also tragic, because she died at such an early age. The song I do at karaoke
  I’m really bad at karaoke. I guess I would do Dreams by Fleetwood Mac. The
  singer in me wants to sound like Stevie Nicks, but unfortunately Martha shows
  up pretty fast in my karaoke interpretations. The best song to have sex to
  I’ll tell you the worst: when you can hear your parents playing their own
  music – such as (Talk to Me of) Mendocino by Kate and Anna McGarrigle – while
  they are having sex. Don’t ever do that. The song I inexplicably know every
  lyric to I’m really bad with lyrics. I’ll sing songs thousands of times but
  still have to have them written down. When I was young, I learned all the
  background parts to I’m Your Man by Leonard Cohen, because I wanted to be his
  backing singer. There’s a really weird song on there called Jazz Police that I
  know all the lyrics to. The song I secretly like Memory from Cats is the sort
  of song I’d have made fun of in the past. But now it gets me, because I
  learned it with my son. The song that makes me cry Le Blues du Businessman –
  The Businessman’s Blues – from 70s Canadian-French rock opera Starmania.
  Martha Wainwright is touring to 30 August; tour starts Shrewsbury folk
  festival, 24 August.
