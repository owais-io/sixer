  Public health experts have expressed concern for the future of a “vital”
  health survey, after the government said it would no longer be run by NHS
  England. The Health Survey for England, launched in 1991, is an annual study
  that collects data from about 8,000 adults and 2,000 children across the
  country, through face-to-face interviews and questionnaires. It gathers data
  on a range of important health metrics such as height and weight, smoking and
  alcohol use, with public experts describing it as an “arterial” source of data
  due it being nationally representative and high quality. At a briefing in July
  by the UK Data Service, the government said the 2025 edition would be the last
  one because “NHS England will not be prioritising population health surveys in
  its long-term strategic work plan”. The news comes amid unprecedented cost
  cutting within the NHS, as the health service faces a predicted shortfall of
  nearly £7.7bn this financial year. The government has said that the survey is
  not being stood down, but will no longer be run by NHS England. However,
  details regarding how the survey will be run have not yet been revealed as the
  government says it is exploring alternative ways of collecting the same
  information as the health survey. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all
  have their own individual health surveys. Veena Raleigh, a senior fellow at
  the King’s Fund, said the survey was an “arterial source of information on the
  health of our population” that has been instrumental in shaping and monitoring
  health services and policy decisions across England, including blood pressure,
  smoking and obesity. She said: “Without the Health Survey for England, we
  would not have invaluable data on current trends in population health and
  whether the NHS is reaching and treating people and communities who are most
  at risk of poor health. “At The King’s Fund the survey data has enabled us to
  assess trends and inequalities in the proportion of people who have multiple
  risk factors such as smoking, poor diet and excess alcohol use. The research
  would not have been possible without the Health Survey for England data.” Prof
  Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the survey would
  need to be “replaced with something similar, generating the vital information
  that organisations across healthcare need to monitor changes in public
  health”. She said: “Effective public health policy, which has an impact on our
  patients, relies on up-to-date and good quality data, so it is concerning that
  NHS England is considering scrapping the Health Survey for England.” Prof
  Oyinlola Oyebode, who leads the Centre for Public Health and Policy at Queen
  Mary, University of London, said the survey had provided vital data that had
  “revealed under-diagnosed conditions, such as diabetes and chronic kidney
  disease, and tracked health trends like obesity and secondhand smoke
  exposure”. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “The
  Health Survey for England is not being stood down. We are working closely with
  NHS England and the Office for National Statistics to explore alternative
  improved approaches to ensure there is essential health monitoring beyond
  2025. “We will ensure that decision-makers continue to have access to
  high-quality population health data that improves health outcomes across
  England.”
