  As Donald Trump’s Department of Justice expands investigations of his foes and
  ousts dozens of lawyers and staff who worked on cases targeting himself and
  his allies, scholars and ex-prosecutors say the rule of law is under siege in
  the US as the department morphs into Trump’s “personal weapon”. The justice
  department’s politicization to please Trump was underscored by an announcement
  on 23 July of a new “ strike force” to investigate unsubstantiated charges
  that ex-president Barack Obama and top officials conspired to hurt Trump’s
  2016 campaign and his presidency with inquiries into Russian influence
  operations to help Trump win, say critics. The announcement came the day after
  Trump dodged queries from reporters about the justice department’s failure to
  produce long-promised files about the notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey
  Epstein, and pivoted to blast Obama without evidence for “treason”. Trump’s
  conspiratorial charge echoed dubious claims by his national intelligence
  director, Tulsi Gabbard, who days before called for a justice department
  inquiry into a purported “treasonous conspiracy”. Likewise, the FBI earlier in
  July announced investigations into the ex-FBI director James Comey and ex-CIA
  director John Brennan, which critics see as political efforts to placate Trump
  who has often voiced anger at them for their roles in the Russia
  investigations before and during his first term. Legal scholars and
  ex-prosecutors say Trump and his loyal attorney general, Pam Bondi, have
  turned the justice department into his personal law firm to pursue his
  political and legal agendas. “It’s not unprecedented for presidents to deploy
  their powers for personal ends, but no one including Nixon has done this with
  the intensity of Trump,” Peter Shane, who teaches constitutional law at New
  York University, told the Guardian. Shane added: “DoJ is now being used as a
  personal weapon on behalf of Trump to a degree that is without precedent.
  Trump has a team of sycophants and enablers at DoJ. They’re not behaving the
  way office holders sworn to uphold the constitution are expected to behave.
  “The idea that the Obama administration fabricated the story of Russian
  interference has been refuted multiple times, including by the Senate
  intelligence committee when, under the chairmanship of then senator Marco
  Rubio, the committee determined that Russia had indeed launched an aggressive
  covert effort to interfere in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf.” Other
  scholars raise similar alarms. “Trump is using the justice department to
  target his perceived enemies and pursue his political goals,” said Randall
  Eliason, a former federal prosecutor who now lectures on law at George
  Washington University. “The guiding principle for any DoJ prosecutor has
  always been loyalty to the constitution and the rule of law. Under this
  administration, it appears that the primary job requirement for any DoJ
  prosecutor, up to and including the attorney general, is loyalty to Donald
  Trump.” The premium that Trump has placed on loyalty at the justice department
  was revealed early by his choices of Bondi as attorney general, Todd Blanche
  as deputy attorney general and other senior officials. Bondi, an ex-Florida
  attorney general, helped defend Trump in the Senate during his first
  impeachment, and Blanche was his lead counsel in New York where Trump was
  convicted in 2024 of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records to hide
  payments during his 2016 campaign to a porn star who alleged an affair with
  him. The justice department’s drive to please Trump was evident in July when
  Bondi fired about 20 departmental employees. They included support staff and
  several prosecutors who worked on January 6 cases for special counsel Jack
  Smith, who charged Trump with improperly retaining hundreds of classified
  documents after he left office in early 2021, and for engaging in an
  “unprecedented criminal effort” to stay in power after his 2020 election loss.
  Notably, Bondi this month abruptly fired without explanation the department’s
  top ethics official, Joseph Tirrell, and Maureen Comey, a key prosecutor in
  New York who had worked on charges against Epstein and is James Comey’s
  daughter. Several senior justice department and FBI officials were ousted in
  the first months of Trump’s second presidency. For their part, Trump and Bondi
  have been blunt about axing lawyers and staff they deem political foes for
  allegedly politicizing the justice department against Trump. In February, for
  instance, Trump ordered the department to oust all remaining “Biden-era” US
  attorneys, claiming the department “has been politicized like never before”
  under Biden. In a similar vein, before taking office Bondi pledged during a
  confirmation hearing to eliminate what she blasted as “the partisanship, the
  weaponization” of the Department of Justice under Biden. Some ex-prosecutors
  say Trump’s charges that he was the victim of justice department weaponization
  stem from his penchant for conspiratorial thinking. “The inane claims of
  weaponization we hear from Trump and his associates are particularly
  extraordinary because Trump regularly calls for the criminal investigation and
  prosecution of his political enemies,” said Daniel Richman, a former federal
  prosecutor who is now a law professor at Columbia University. “Baseless claims
  of crimes by his political opponents have always been a staple of Trump’s
  rants. But now that he is president and has picked justice department leaders
  for their loyalty and not their competence or integrity, the risk of abusive
  investigations grows.” The justice department’s intense focus on targeting
  Trump critics was evident after Bondi became attorney general when she quickly
  issued a memo establishing a “weaponization” working group, say critics.
  Barbara McQuade, who teaches law at the University of Michigan and used to be
  a federal prosecutor, said Bondi’s memo actually “weaponizes law enforcement
  and undermines public confidence in government” because it pushes a “false
  narrative” about the two special counsel investigations of Trump. McQuade
  stressed that “federal grand juries returned indictments in both cases,
  meaning that they found probable cause that the crimes were committed.” Other
  justice department veterans have been appalled at its transformation including
  the wave of firings. Stacey Young, who spent 18 years as a federal litigator
  at the Department of Justice before leaving voluntarily in January, launched
  the group Justice Connection to help remaining justice department employees
  deal with ethical and legal headaches and find jobs for those who want to
  leave. “These unprecedented firings at the justice department are growing
  exponentially,” Young told the Guardian. “ They happen with no notice and no
  opportunity to be heard, in violation of the Civil Service Reform Act and due
  process. Many people, and even their supervisors, have no idea why the firings
  targeted them or why now. Employees now wake up each day wondering if they’re
  going to be next. “It’s screwing with people’s lives, and it’s also creating a
  culture of fear among the entire workforce. DoJ leadership is making clear the
  ability to keep your job is not tied to your performance, your expertise, or
  your commitment to uphold and defend the constitution.” On 24 July, three
  justice department officials including Tirrell who were abruptly fired this
  summer, filed a lawsuit against Bondi seeking reinstatement and back pay
  arguing that they were axed improperly and without cause. Other ex-federal
  prosecutors say the department is now being weaponized to please Trump. “There
  is literally no reason to fire these people, other than to continue molding
  the department into Trump’s personal law firm,” Mike Romano, an ex-justice
  department prosecutor who left voluntarily in March after almost four years
  working on prosecutions of Trump allies who stormed the Capitol on 6 January
  2021. “Trump and Bondi are bringing us back to the spoils system, where the
  government is not staffed by merit but based on favors, and is not staffed
  with experts, but with hacks and cronies. As a country, we decided almost 150
  years ago that the spoils system is terrible and corrupt.” Further, Bondi and
  Trump have stepped up attacks on judges who have rebuked justice department
  lawyers for presenting arguments in court that were specious or failed to
  respond to judges’ queries, several of which have involved the
  administration’s hardline anti-immigrant actions, say critics. “There are
  certain things lawyers should avoid doing because they are sure to pique the
  ire of federal judges,” said ex-federal judge John Jones, who is president of
  Dickinson College. “These include patronizing, temporizing, lying and making
  baseless arguments. The Trump DoJ lawyers have hit them all before multiple
  judges.” Likewise, Emil Bove III, a key Trump defense lawyer in 2024 who was
  the justice department’s number three for several months before Trump
  nominated him as a federal appeals court judge that the Senate recently
  approved, was cited in one whistleblower complaint for telling department
  lawyers they could flout court orders to further Trump’s immigration agenda.
  More broadly, scholars and justice department veterans see the Trump
  administration breaking sharply with historical norms and rewriting history to
  burnish Trump’s image. “The firing of the January 6 prosecutors and the
  pardons of the Capitol rioters are all part of an effort to whitewash what
  happened on January 6,” said Eliason. “The goal is to portray the rioters as
  the true victims and falsely suggest that the law enforcement professionals
  who pursued these cases did something wrong. “A key foundation of our
  constitutional system is adherence to the rule of law and the independence of
  the justice system from politics. That’s all being discarded by the Trump
  administration.” Shane likewise stressed: “Trump has placed his own lawyers in
  key justice department positions, expecting them to continue thinking of
  themselves as personal lawyers for Donald Trump, not government lawyers for
  the president as an office-holder bound by law.”
