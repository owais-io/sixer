  “You destroyed Iraq.” I had to wait for my companion, the Iraqi journalist
  Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, to translate these words, but the thunderous look on this
  middle-aged man’s face already told its own story. We were standing on Haifa
  Street, one of Baghdad’s main thoroughfares, which runs along the west bank of
  the Tigris, and he had just been told I was British. “They promised that Iraq
  would be a heaven,” he said of the US-UK occupation. He then told a familiar
  tale: of being kidnapped by the sectarian militia, who flourished after the
  2003 US-led invasion, and being tortured so badly that he could barely walk.
  We had come to Haifa Street to retrace Abdul-Ahad’s steps on a gruesome day 21
  years ago. With its alleyways and tall buildings, this two-mile-long road
  proved ideal for urban warfare and snipers, and soon became known as Death
  Street. Early on a Sunday morning in September 2004, Abdul-Ahad rushed from
  his hotel room after learning of an explosion. A crowd had gathered in the
  aftermath, civilians among them. Then two US helicopters fired missiles,
  scattering bodies and dismembered limbs. As he took photographs, men died
  before his eyes, while survivors begged him to “show the world the American
  democracy”. We encountered the angry middle-aged man while searching for a
  concrete shed that Abdul-Ahad had sheltered behind. As we spoke, his anger
  cooled. I have always found Iraqis to be warm by disposition, separating their
  anger at the west from its citizens. But their anger is justified. On the map
  of history, a bloody road leads from Haifa Street to Gaza City. The west’s
  failure to have a reckoning over the Iraq catastrophe made Israel’s genocide
  of the Palestinian people possible. A war of aggression, deemed illegal at the
  time by the then UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, plunged Iraq into murderous
  chaos. At a conservative count, 300,000 Iraqis suffered violent deaths,
  according to the painstaking research of Iraq Body Count, about two-thirds of
  whom were civilians. Some were killed directly by occupation forces.
  Abdul-Ahad notes that the massacre he witnessed was commonplace. This
  particular horror achieved more prominence because he, a Guardian journalist,
  happened to be there. Consider another: the Haditha massacre in 2005, when US
  marines massacred 24 civilians, the youngest of whom was three years old. All
  murder charges against them were dropped. You may have found yourself asking:
  how could a crime as transparently obscene as Gaza be possible? Israel has
  slaughtered Palestinians it labelled “human animals” by the tens of thousands,
  and plunged Gaza into what UN-backed experts describe as an “entirely
  man-made” famine. Thanks to social media, atrocities are broadcast to the
  world daily. Yet the US alone spent nearly $18bn on military aid to Israel in
  the first year of genocide, while western nations offer handwringing rather
  than meaningful sanctions. But the Iraq war proved that Arab life is cheap
  indeed. Only a reckoning could have given it value. As well as by occupation
  bombs and bullets, many more civilians were killed by sectarian militias and
  jihadis. You might wonder why the west should take responsibility for their
  crimes, but Abdul-Ahad’s masterpiece, A Stranger In Your Own City, explored
  how the occupiers institutionalised sectarianism. They brought exiled
  politicians who claimed legitimacy as representatives of Shias and Sunnis,
  dividing communities. The mistreatment of the Sunni minority proved
  fundamental to the rise of Islamic State and all the mayhem that spawned. The
  lack of a reckoning has proved calamitous. We did have the damning findings of
  Britain’s Chilcot inquiry in 2016, which found Tony Blair “chose to join the
  invasion of Iraq before the peaceful options for disarmament had been
  exhausted” and that he had deliberately exaggerated the threat posed by Saddam
  Hussein. But Iraq is for ever etched in western memory as a blunder, rather
  than a crime. Blair’s post-prime ministerial career flourished and he made
  millions from despotic states such as Saudi Arabia and Kazakhstan. Media
  outlets treat him with deference, as an elder statesman. George W Bush is now
  feted by US liberals as a “decent” Republican compared with Donald Trump,
  presumably because he doesn’t send mean tweets. Trump is unquestionably more
  of a threat to US democracy, but Bush slaughtered far more abroad. Meanwhile,
  the journalists who cheered on this bloodbath suffered no consequences to
  their careers and reputations. That the three major western wars of the 21st
  century – Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya – all ended in catastrophe has barely
  been processed. According to a study by Brown University, more than 4.5
  million people died from direct and indirect causes in these and other
  conflicts including Syria. In a rational world, this would prompt a major
  crisis, with politicians jailed and journalistic cheerleaders fired in
  disgrace. That did not happen. If it had, would Israel’s genocide in Gaza have
  been possible? This historic crime has been enabled by western military,
  political and diplomatic support. If most western media had not defended or
  whitewashed Israel’s atrocities, it would have been impossible for governments
  to facilitate this genocidal rampage. Iraq has not forgotten. Its capital now
  seems peaceful, a skyline of cranes testament to a construction boom – “Luxury
  in the heart of Baghdad” boasts one development – albeit some of it driven by
  corruption and causing local people to be priced out. But the sectarian
  militia are embedded in the state, menacing their critics. Dotted throughout
  the city, alongside adverts for Sprite and mobile phones, are billboards
  commemorating the victims of war. “They were martyred by the treacherous
  American bombing,” reads one outside my hotel. The west has always stripped
  its victims’ lives of meaning. This dehumanisation was a necessary
  precondition for subjugating them, whether by the conquistadors in the
  Americas, the Belgians in Congo or the British in India. Given there was no
  reckoning for these crimes, some might ask why Gaza will prove the exception.
  They should consider that the west has spent the 21st century in a death
  spiral of decline, whether your measurements are military, economic or moral
  standing. A livestreamed genocide means too many have seen, heard and read too
  much. This time, unlike the killing fields of Iraq, there must be a reckoning
  with the politicians and media outlets complicit in the erasure of Gaza from
  the world map, and the slaughter, maiming and starvation of its people. As our
  recent history shows, if accountability does not arrive, then we make future
  crimes not just possible, but inevitable. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist
