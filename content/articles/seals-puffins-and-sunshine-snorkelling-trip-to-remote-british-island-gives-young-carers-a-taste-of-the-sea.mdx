  “A seal just swam right by me,” squeals Odin Rawlinson, 14, as he awkwardly
  clambers back on to the dive boat in his flippers. He had hoped to see a
  megalodon or a kraken (a mythical sea creature) on his first ever snorkelling
  trip. But to his surprise, he finds the marine life that actually frequents
  the waters off Lundy in the Bristol Channel just as enchanting. Odin Rawlinson
  on the trip to Lundy – the 14-year-old looks after his mother who has kidney
  failure and has to have regular dialysis sessions in hospital. “I feel
  honoured,” he says. “Not everyone gets to have a seal just casually swim by
  them.” Not everyone deals with the same daily challenges faced by Odin, whose
  mum has kidney failure and has to have lengthy dialysis sessions in hospital
  three times a week. Alongside all the other children on this snorkel trip,
  Odin is a young carer, trying to manage a family member’s needs due to illness
  or disability with their own. Some estimates show there may be over 800,000
  young carers in the UK, with children facing difficulties at school, social
  isolation and increased stress. The outing is the work of Seaful, a charity
  dedicated to connecting people with the ocean for their own wellbeing, but
  also to create advocates for marine preservation. Young carers enjoy their
  outing to Lundy, experiencing the wildlife from a new perspective while
  snorkelling in the waters around the island Lundy Diving’s Obsession II and
  the Barbara B at anchor as the young carers snorkel off the island “Some of
  these kids live near the sea but never get the opportunity to connect with it
  because of what they deal with at home,” says Lorna Evans from Seaful.
  “Without a personal connection to the ocean, we cannot expect people to care
  about it. The idea is to provide opportunities to people like these young
  carers, who are most in need of something special, in order to make them fall
  in love with the sea – because when you love something, you will help protect
  it.” It’s not hard to fall in love with it on a beautiful summer day, when the
  sea is a dazzling expanse of turquoise glinting in the sun. After about an
  hour’s cruise from Ilfracombe harbour, Lundy emerges on the horizon, a granite
  outcrop whose pristine waters are teeming with life. In 2010 it became the
  UK’s first marine conservation zone and features sandbanks, reefs and sea
  caves as well as a substantial grey seal population. There is delight on board
  when several seals are spotted in the water and Seaful’s team advises everyone
  on how to behave without disturbing them. Odin gets lucky with his closeup
  encounter, but for all of the young carers, today’s ocean adventure is a high
  point. A playful grey seal swimming among a kelp forest in the sea off Lundy
  in the Bristol Channel “For some of these children here today, this is a once
  in a lifetime experience – a lot of their families would never be able to take
  them on this sort of trip,” says Evans. “Just being next to the sea is
  beneficial to mental health. People feel a oneness and sense of peace with the
  open space.” Laurence D’Ambrogio, 13, has an older brother with ADHD and
  autism. “There are lots of places we can’t go – family trips are really
  difficult. I also have to look out for my younger brother quite often,” he
  says. “There are lots of times when I can’t do things, I can’t go out. I can’t
  have friends round very often. So today is a nice break – getting away from it
  all,” he says, reclining on the boat’s top deck to make the most of the
  panoramic views. Laurence proves to be the group’s most enthusiastic
  snorkeller, going back in the water for a third time when most of the others
  are cold and tired. A view of Lundy from the boats Laurence D’Ambrogio, left,

  the children out on trips is a tradition started by her late father, Andrew
  Handing out some much needed sweets and hot chocolate is Gemma Bengey,
  co-owner of Lundy Diving, which has provided the boats and crew for the trip.
  Her late father, Andrew, took a previous group of young carers to Lundy and
  Gemma and her brother Ben are continuing to run the Seaful trips in his
  memory. “My dad just loved giving kids who don’t get these opportunities the
  chance to go out to sea,” she says. “Out here, they can forget about their
  responsibilities for a day, they can forget about everything.” One of the
  young carers investigates a rock underwater and right, a jellyfish floats by
  As the boat pootles round the island, guillemots, razorbills and puffins swoop
  overhead and seals continually pop up in the water. On the way home, the boat
  slaps into swells from an easterly wind, and the young people enjoy getting
  drenched with sea spray on the bumpy ride. By the time they reach the quayside
  at the end of the trip, some are swapping phone numbers, promising to meet
  again. Simon Barker, a local diving instructor who taught the children the
  basics of snorkelling in a pool the day before their trip, also volunteered to
  accompany them. “To have that ability to go under the water, immerse yourself
  in it and experience it in 3D, then that makes for an incredible experience,
  especially for these children,” he says. “When you see the wow factor on their
  faces, it gives you a real buzz. The ocean is key to life on this planet, and
  if we can pass on a bit of passion for the sea to others, then that’s all we
  can wish for.” On the boat with Odin Rawlinson (left), Darci Keenann (centre)
