  Phillip Inman writes that “Early retirement is a wealthy indulgence that needs
  to be discouraged” (Get early retirees off the golf course and back to work –
  why early retirement isn’t good for UK plc, 26 July). He elicits cliches of
  golf courses and cruises enjoyed by older people who are not working. The
  reality for many, however, is very different. The average age of labour market
  exit is rising, reaching a new high last year of 65.7 for men and 64.5 for
  women. However, we know that many people struggle to remain in work in the
  years before they reach the state pension age. Poor health and providing care
  for loved ones are two key reasons. The current labour market offers
  inadequate support and flexibility for these challenges, and people receive
  little in the way of retraining or help to use transferable skills. All of
  this reduces the potential for people to work. This leaves many facing real
  hardship in retirement, years before they can draw a pension. The wealthy baby
  boomer stereotype masks a problem – there is significant and increasing
  inequality in pensioner incomes. We must abandon ageist stereotypes and talk
  about this group in a more nuanced way if we are to make the right calls on
  pensions policy – for all our sakes. Fair access to work in later life is
  already an urgent imperative, and will only become more so if the state
  pension age is to continue rising. Dr Carole Easton Chief executive, Centre
  for Ageing Better • What an insulting and stereotyped picture Phillip Inman
  paints of early retirees. I earned my choice to retire at 55 by working for
  almost 40 years and paying into a pension from my early 20s. I’ve never played
  golf and the idea of a cruise is anathema to me. I’m not working my way
  through a bucket list and I haven’t left England since I retired. But I do
  volunteer, putting back into my community along with thousands of other
  retirees who donate thousands of hours of their time each year. Where would
  charity shops, community centres, Citizens Advice bureaux be without early
  retirees? Who would look after all those grandchildren whose parents can’t
  afford childcare? Mr Inman should widen his outlook rather than write off a
  whole section of the community with his sweeping comments. Jenny Chittenden
