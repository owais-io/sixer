  Greece has passed draconian legislation that could mean rejected asylum
  seekers receiving prison terms, fines and orders to wear ankle tags, in a move
  that reflects the centre-right government’s continued attempts to deter
  undocumented migrants from arriving on its soil. The tough penalties usher in
  an unprecedented era of zero tolerance for people who remain in the country if
  their asylum claims are denied. As a frontier state, long viewed as a gateway
  to Europe, Greece has had a surge in migrant arrivals this year. “We are
  accountable to Greek citizens, and Greek citizens want to be protected,” the
  migration minister, Thanos Plevris, told MPs ahead of voting. “The message is
  clear [for migrants]: if your asylum request is rejected, you have two
  choices. Either you go to jail or return to your homeland. The Greek state
  does not accept you … You are not welcome.” An unabashed rightwinger whose
  stance has caused ripples among the more moderate members of Greece’s
  centre-right government, Plevris insisted asylum would continue to be granted
  to applicants who fulfilled the need for international protection. But under
  the new law, asylum seekers who have their claims rejected and do not leave
  the country within 14 days face prison terms of two to five years. Deterrence
  measures will also be toughened: people who arrive without the proper
  paperwork will be detained for 24 months, up from the current 18 months, while
  unregulated migrants who have been in Greece for seven years will no longer
  have the right to legalise their status. Those found guilty of illegal entry
  will be fined €10,000. The measures come barely two months after the prime
  minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced a controversial 90-day pause on
  asylum applications amid a rise in arrivals on the islands of Crete and Gavdos
  from Libya. In the first week of July, more than 2,000 people successfully
  made the crossing – a significant increase in a country where migrant numbers
  have fallen dramatically since 2015, when more than 850,000 people arrived at
  the height of the refugee crisis. Mitsotakis insisted the suspension was aimed
  at sending smuggling rings a resounding message that “the passage to Greece is
  closed”, though it was condemned by human rights groups as a grave violation
  of international law. In power since 2019, the government describes its
  migration policies as “tough but fair”, denying allegations of illegal
  pushbacks to keep asylum seekers at bay. Addressing parliament, Plevris said
  he was proud to have overseen the legislation, which will put Greece at the
  forefront of policies that few EU members have wanted to enforce. But on
  Wednesday the backlash was as instant as it was broad, with judges taking the
  unprecedented step of weighing in to criticise the legislation’s emphasis on
  repression. Highlighting the lack of consensus over the measures, Dimitris
  Kairidis, who stepped down as migration and asylum minister in 2024, told the
  Guardian that while deterrence remained paramount, it was vital Athens also
  eased legal pathways of migration at a time when labour shortages were acute.
  “Greece needs both to counter illegal, but also encourage legal, migration as
  needed by its growing economy,” he said. During his tenure, Kairidis legalised
  the status of 30,000 unregistered migrant labourers desperately required in
  the agriculture, construction and tourism sectors. With Greece gripped by a
  demographic crisis that last week forced the education ministry to close more
  than 750 schools because of the lack of pupils, migrant solidarity workers
  called the law racist and nonsensical. “It’s so contradictory that this should
  be passed when Greece’s population is in such freefall, and when migrants
  offer the solution to labour shortages,” said the director of the Greek
  Council for Refugees, Lefteris Papagiannakis. “Mitsotakis has managed to hold
  the centre ground. With this openly racist law, he is clearly trying to
  enlarge his voter pool by appealing to the far right.”
