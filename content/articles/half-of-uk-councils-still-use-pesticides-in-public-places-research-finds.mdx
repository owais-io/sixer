  More than half of councils in the United Kingdom continue to use pesticides in
  parks, playgrounds, pavements, playing fields and housing estates, research
  revealed on Wednesday. But increasingly, local authorities are taking action
  to end or reduce their use of pesticides, according to research by the
  Pesticide Action Network. The most widely used pesticide by local authorities
  is the weedkiller glyphosate, which has been linked to cancer. The overuse of
  pesticides has also been linked to major declines in wildlife, including
  birds, bees and hedgehogs. PAN sent freedom of information requests to
  councils across the UK and had responses from more than 90%. Of the 368 local
  authorities who replied, 165, or 45% were taking action to end or reduce their
  use of pesticide. Nick Mole, a policy manager at PAN UK, said: “While there is
  still work to do, this survey shows that the pesticide-free movement is
  growing. A decade ago, no one even knew that pesticides were used in villages,
  towns and cities. Now we have more than 100 councils taking action to protect
  the health of residents, wildlife and pets.” PAN released polling on Wednesday
  that showed the public was supportive of moves to reduce or end pesticide use
  in public places. Two-thirds of those surveyed (65%) agreed that “schools,
  parks, playgrounds and other public spaces in their local area should be
  pesticide-free”, with a third (33%) strongly agreeing. The research showed
  some councils were doing better than others to end pesticide use. Of the
  councils that responded, almost half (47%) said they did not use pesticides on
  playing fields; about a third (34%) kept cemeteries pesticide-free, and about
  a quarter (26%) managed their parks and green spaces without pesticides.
  London is leading the way in the movement to have pesticide-free public
  spaces, which are already the norm in Paris. Of the capital’s 33 councils, 23
  said they had either ended their pesticide use or were moving in that
  direction. “The UK public is largely onside and countries like France and
  Denmark – which have banned urban pesticide use nationwide – are showing every
  day that we simply don’t need chemicals to maintain public spaces,” said Mole.
  Councils said they used 354 tonnes of pesticides in 2024. This was four times
  the figure from government data of 84 tonnes of pesticides used by local
  authorities, the research suggested. A number of councils have already banned
  pesticides, including Lambeth, Glastonbury and Lewes. Brighton and Hove
  council banned pesticides in 2019, but in 2024, after complaints about weeds
  (56, according to later reporting), announced that it would be using the
  controlled droplet application of glyphosate in specific areas and would
  reduce usage to the lowest amount possible. A bill, tabled by the Green MP
  Siân Berry, is going through parliament to end pesticide use in public spaces.
