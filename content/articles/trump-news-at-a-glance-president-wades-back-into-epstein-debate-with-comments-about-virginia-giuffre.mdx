  Donald Trump has spoken about Jeffrey Epstein and his links to the president’s
  Mar-a-Lago club, saying that the late sex offender “stole” Virginia Giuffre
  and other young female staffers when he hired them while they were working at
  the Florida country club. Trump, who has faced an outcry over his
  administration’s refusal to release more records about Epstein after promises
  of transparency, made the comments on Air Force One while returning from a
  trip to Scotland. Trump has attempted to tamp down questions about the case,
  expressing annoyance that people are still talking about it six years after
  Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial, even though some of his own
  allies have promoted conspiracy theories about it. On Tuesday, a reporter
  asked Trump: “The workers that were taken from you – were some of them young
  women?” Trump replied: “The answer is yes, they were. People that worked in
  the spa.” Another reporter then asked Trump if one of the people he was
  referring to was Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers. “I think
  she worked at the spa,” Trump replied. Here are the key Trump stories of the
  day: Trump: Epstein ‘stole’ Virginia Giuffre Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday
  that Jeffrey Epstein, the late sex offender he socialized with for more than a
  decade, “stole” Virginia Giuffre and other young female staffers whom he hired
  away from the president’s Mar-a-Lago country club. Speaking to reporters
  onboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington from Scotland, Trump was
  asked to elaborate on his earlier comments about falling out with Epstein
  because he took employees from his business. The president said on Monday that
  he had kicked Epstein out of his club “because he did something that was
  inappropriate” – specifically, that “he stole people that worked for me”. Read
  the full story Trump lawyer Emil Bove confirmed to US appeals court The Senate
  on Tuesday confirmed Emil Bove, a top justice department official and former
  defense attorney for Donald Trump, to a lifetime seat on a federal appeals
  court, despite claims by whistleblowers that he advocated for ignoring court
  orders. The vote broke nearly along party lines, with 50 Republican senators
  voting for his confirmation to a seat on the third circuit court of appeals
  overseeing New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and the US Virgin Islands. All
  Democrats opposed his nomination along with Republican senators Susan Collins
  and Lisa Murkowski. Tennessee senator Bill Hagerty missed the vote. Read the
  full story US and China poised to extend tariff truce after failing to find
  resolution at talks US and Chinese negotiators have agreed in principle to
  push back the deadline for escalating tariffs, although America’s
  representatives said any extension would need Donald Trump’s approval.
  Officials from both sides said after two days of talks in Stockholm that they
  had failed to find a resolution across the many areas of dispute, but had
  agreed to extend a pause due to run out on 12 August. Beijing’s top trade
  negotiator, Li Chenggang, said the extension of a truce struck in mid-May
  would allow for further talks, without specifying when and for how long the
  latest pause would run. Read the full story Ghislaine Maxwell demands immunity

  Congress but only if certain conditions are met, including being granted

  her lawyer on Tuesday. Read the full story DoJ asked California to give

  has asked several large California counties to provide detailed personal

  to provide wide swaths of information about voters and election practices.

  program to provide ID cards to residents who may not be able to access such

  program, fearing the information will be used to aid mass deportations. Donald
  Trump’s crackdown on immigration is piling pressure on US factories, according
  to employees and union leaders, as veteran workers from overseas are forced to
  leave their jobs. Harvard University said on Tuesday that it will comply with
