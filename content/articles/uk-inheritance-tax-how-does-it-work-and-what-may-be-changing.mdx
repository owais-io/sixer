  The Treasury is looking at ways to increase the money it collects through
  inheritance tax (IHT), sources have told the Guardian. Ideas on the table
  include a review of the rules on giving away assets, with one possibility
  being the introduction of a lifetime cap on how much an individual can donate.
  Any changes would come on top of other moves the government has already made
  to close IHT loopholes. What is inheritance tax? IHT is a tax paid on
  someone’s assets (property, possessions and money) after they die, but only if
  they leave enough to go above a certain threshold. The standard IHT rate is
  40%, and it is charged only on the part of the estate that is above the
  tax-free threshold – currently £325,000 for an individual. However, the rules
  are complex and the threshold is different if a property is involved and can
  be higher if you are married or in a civil partnership and your partner did
  not use all of their allowance when they died. What could be changed? You can
  currently give away all of your money and assets to your spouse or civil
  partner, charities or political parties, or to anyone else as long as you time
  it right. Otherwise, there could be an IHT bill for your estate when you die.
  One idea reportedly being considered is a lifetime cap on how much individuals
  can give away – anything above which would attract tax. This is the case in
  lots of other countries, including the US. What do you mean about timing it
  right? There is a currently a seven-year rule on gifts. If you give something
  to someone other than the exempt group, IHT may be due if you die within seven
  years of doing so. These gifts are called “potentially exempt transfers”
  because if you live long enough they are IHT-free. The rule is designed to
  stop you giving away lots of assets at the last minute. Anyone dealing with an
  estate – the executors or a solicitor employed by them – will be expected to
  declare anything the deceased has given away in the seven years before he or
  she died. The gifts are added up – starting with the earliest in the seven
  years – plus the rest of the estate. If the total comes to more than £325,000,
  it passes the IHT threshold. For the first three years after you have made the
  gift, if you die it could attract a tax bill of 40%. After that the potential
  tax bill goes down incrementally each year, so in the last of the seven years
  it is 8%. An alternative to a lifetime cap could be a change to the seven-year
  rule – the period in which you can make potentially exempt transfers could be
  reduced, and the taper made less generous. Currently not everything you give
  away will be included in the tax department’s calculations: there are
  allowances you can use to make gifts. What allowances are available? Every tax
  year you can give away up to £3,000 without there being a potential for IHT.
  The money can go to one person or many. You can also make “small gifts” of up
  to £250 a year to as many people as you want, as long as you have not used any
  of the £3,000 allowance on them. Birthday and Christmas presents do not count
  towards these allowances. There are also allowances for wedding and civil
  partnership gifts, of up to £5,000 if it is your child who is tying the knot.
  Regular payments – for someone’s rent or into a savings account, for instance
  – could also be tax free. For these to qualify as non-taxable they need to be
  paid out of your monthly income and leave you with enough money to live on.
  These are called “normal expenditure out of income”. I’ve received a gift from
  someone who died, will I have to give part back? Gifts are counted first
  before the rest of the estate, so most IHT will be paid for via other assets.
  However, in those cases where the total value of qualifying gifts is over the
  IHT threshold, the recipient may have some tax to pay. It’s a wise idea for
  the donor and the receiver to keep records of large gifts, particularly if
  they are purposely part of IHT planning. This will make it easier for the
  executors to work out what, if anything, must be paid. What changes has the
  government already made? In last year’s budget it made changes to the
  allowances around businesses and agricultural land. From April next year, a
  20% tax rate will be applied to the value of farms and businesses worth more
  than £1m when they are passed on. Previously it was possible to pass these on
  with no IHT bill. Another change announced then will bring unused pensions
  into IHT. From April 2027 any unused fund that is being passed on will be
  included in the estate for IHT calculations. Currently pension money can be
  passed on without a bill. The government this week confirmed that the pension
  rule will apply even if the person saving into the fund was too young to
  access it at the time of their death. How much does IHT raise? Only 4.6% of
  deaths resulted in IHT being paid in the tax year 2022-23, according to the
  latest figures from HMRC. The average effective tax rate for estates was 13%,
  after accounting for all the different reliefs and exemptions that might apply
  depending on the individual circumstances. That compares with the headline
  rate of 40%. It is impossible to predict how much closing loopholes will bring
  in as changing the rules tends to lead to a change in behaviour. Not long
  after the pension change was announced there were signs that wealthy investors
  were starting to withdraw money from their funds. A lifetime limit might
  change people’s behaviour as it could encourage people not to give away money
  early in their life. What difference it makes to the ultimate tax take will
  depend on the level it is set at and how it is applied to people who have
  already given away large sums under the current system. • This article was
  amended on 14 August 2025 to clarify that changes to the allowances around
  businesses and agricultural land come into force in April 2026.
