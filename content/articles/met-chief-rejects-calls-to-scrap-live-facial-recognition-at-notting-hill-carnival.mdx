  The Metropolitan police commissioner has hit back at demands to drop the use
  of live facial recognition cameras at this weekend’s Notting Hill carnival
  over concerns of racial bias and an impending legal challenge. Mark Rowley
  wrote in a letter that the instant face-matching technology would be used at
  Europe’s biggest street carnival “in a non-discriminatory way” using an
  algorithm that “does not perform in a way which exhibits bias”. He was
  responding to a letter from 11 anti-racist and civil liberty organisations,
  disclosed in the Guardian, that urged the Met to scrap the use of the
  technology at an event that celebrates the African-Caribbean community. The
  Runnymede Trust, Liberty, Big Brother Watch, Race on the Agenda, and Human
  Rights Watch were among those who claimed in the letter to Rowley on Saturday
  that the technology “will only exacerbate concerns about abuses of state power
  and racial discrimination within your force”. Campaigners claim the police
  have been allowed to “self-regulate” their use of the technology because of
  the lack of a legal framework and deploy the technology’s algorithm at lower
  settings that are biased against ethnic minorities and women. The Met said
  last month it would deploy specially mounted cameras at entries and exits of
  the two-day event in west London. As many as 2 million people attend the
  second-biggest street festival in the world every year, held on the August
  bank holiday weekend. In his letter sent to the NGOs and charities, Rowley
  acknowledged that previous use of the technology at the carnival in 2016 and
  2017 did not build public confidence. The Met’s former facial recognition
  system, which has since been improved, incorrectly identified 102 people as
  potential suspects and led to no arrests. “Since then, we’ve made considerable
  progress. The current version of the algorithm is significantly improved, has
  undergone independent testing and validation, and now performs to a much
  higher standard,” Rowley said. He said the technology would target the “small
  minority” who commit serious crimes including violence and sexual offences. In
  2024 there were 349 arrests made at the event, including for homicide, rape,
  possession of weapons, and other violence-related and sexual offences, Rowley
  said. “Together, these offences represent a threat to public safety and all
  those who seek to enjoy carnival safely. Our use of LFR is part of a much
  broader strategy to locate, disrupt, and deter the minority who pose such
  risks.” Civil liberty groups have called on the Met to drop the use of LFR
  cameras after a high court challenge was launched last month by the anti-knife
  campaigner Shaun Thompson. Thompson, a Black British man, was wrongly
  identified by LFR as a criminal, held by police, and then faced demands from
  officers for his fingerprints. Rowley’s letter did not address Thompson’s
  challenge but dismissed claims that the police were operating without a legal
  framework. “The Equality Act 2010 places a legal obligation on public
  authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination,” he
  wrote, adding that the European convention on human rights, and data
  protection laws, also covered LFR technology. Responding to Rowley’s letter,
  Rebecca Vincent, the interim director of the civil liberties group Big Brother
  Watch, said: “With no legislation governing live facial recognition, no
  governmental framework as promised by the home secretary, and a crucial
  judicial review pending, why the rush to accelerate use of this Orwellian
  technology? We’re meant to operate on the basis of ‘policing by consent’, yet
  no one has consented to this, and certainly not the attendees of this cultural
  celebration. “We all want criminals off the streets, but turning carnival into
  a mass police lineup is not the way to do it.”
