  Takeshi Niinami, one of Japan’s best-known business leaders, has resigned as
  chief executive of the drinks company Suntory after police raided his home as
  part of an investigation into suspected illegal supplements. His resignation
  from the owner of the Jim Beam whisky brand has sent shockwaves through
  Japan’s corporate world, with Suntory executives attempting to reassure
  investors and consumers at a hastily arranged news conference. The Tokyo
  Shimbun newspaper said police were investigating Niinami over a suspected
  violation of Japan’s strict cannabis laws. The executive, who has not
  commented publicly on the allegations, reportedly offered to resign after
  returning from an overseas trip on Monday. Media reports said police had
  searched his luxury apartment in Tokyo last month, adding that a urine sample
  had been taken. No illegal substances were found, they said. The broadcaster
  Nippon TV, citing unnamed sources, said Niinami was suspected of importing
  products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, from the US.
  While CBD products are legal in Japan, they must be free of THC. Possession of
  cannabis can be punishable by up to seven years in prison. Niinami, who has
  denied any wrongdoing, told the company he had bought the supplements in the
  belief that they were legal, Suntory’s president, Nobuhiro Torii, said on
  Tuesday. “The entire company will work together to regain trust,” Torii said.
  Suntory had concluded that Niinami’s actions “inevitably fall short of the
  qualities required” of a chief executive, he said, adding that executives felt
  there was no need to wait until the end of the police investigation before
  accepting his resignation. Niinami’s departure will raise questions over the
  future of his strategy, launched when he became chief executive more than a
  decade ago, to raise Suntory’s global profile to address slowing consumption
  at home and counter intense international competition. As chair of the Japan
  Association of Corporate Executives, the country’s second-biggest business
  lobby group, the Harvard-educated executive has used his regular media
  appearances to criticise traditional business practices. Internationally, he
  was seen as an antidote to Japan’s risk-averse corporate culture. He is also a
  member of prime minister Shigeru Ishiba’s Council on Economic and Fiscal
  Policy. Unusually for a Japanese executive, Niinami has publicly commented on
  sensitive political and social issues. In July he called on the Bank of Japan
  to raise interest rates – a move he said would relieve pressure on households
  struggling with the cost of living crisis. In 2023, he criticised Japan’s
  former biggest boyband agency after revelations about decades of sexual abuse
  by its late founder, Johnny Kitagawa. Niinami joined Suntory, one of the
  world’s biggest drinks groups, in 2014 – becoming the first executive outside
  the founding family – after 12 years as chief executive of the convenience
  store chain Lawson. Known for its celebrated single malt whiskies, Suntory has
  265 group companies and employs more than 40,000 people worldwide. Its brands
  include Laphroaig, Orangina and Lucozade. In 2014 it acquired the US maker of
  Jim Beam for $16bn to become one of the world’s biggest spirits makers.
