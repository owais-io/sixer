  “I’m a bit younger, so this is all I’ve known,” says Nick Clarke, “but
  something that defines this moment is the feeling that it’s our last chance.
  You know that phrase: ‘The game’s gone’? I think the game is genuinely going
  away. It’s excluding traditional supporters and the communities that built the
  clubs in the first place.” Clarke has just celebrated his 30th birthday and is
  coming off the back of a big season. As one of the four season-ticket holders
  behind the MCFC Fans Foodbank Support, Clarke has been active among the
  Manchester City fanbase and in the community since the pandemic. With the
  growing concern over the pricing and provision of tickets at his club last
  year, he helped coordinate protests by fans whose rivalries go back
  generations, but whose problems are increasingly shared. Supporters of
  Everton, Liverpool and Manchester United and others joined City fans under the
  banner “Stop Exploiting Loyalty” and in doing so became part of a new wave of
  supporter activism. “I know there’s all these things about multi-club
  ownership, private and state ownership, playing games abroad, accusations of
  killing the soul of the game,” Clarke says. “But, really, what is the game?
  It’s the communities that go to it, it’s the communities that have made the
  clubs who they are, going back four, five, six generations till their very
  inception. “The wider football supporter community are only just now cottoning
  on that we have so much more in common and if we don’t stand together the game
  is going to be gone before we know it. That’s all we have to do and all we can
  do. We just need to really keep up that momentum.” It already seems there will
  be reason for fans to take a stand once more this season. It is not the first
  time they will have come together to demand change, but for those with clubs
  at the top of the pyramid there is a sense the ground is shifting and the
  needs of fans is becoming an afterthought, if not an outright problem. At the
  heart is a concern that clubs want to move away from having matches filled
  with season-ticket holders towards something more casual, and more lucrative.
  Imagine every Premier League fixture becoming more like an Oasis gig, for
  ever. “The problems are different at different levels of the game,” says Tom
  Greatrex, the new chair of the Football Supporters’ Association, who drove the
  Stop Exploiting Loyalty campaign. “In the Premier League, and at the top of
  the Championship, Stop Exploiting Loyalty has helped to bring to the fore a
  set of issues that have been developing over a period of time. “We are seeing
  that parts of clubs’ fanbases, which have traditionally been loyal and go home
  and away, are now almost expendable to not all, but many of the people that
  currently run a number of those clubs. It’s gone beyond exploitation to
  expendability.” Fans are suffering rises in ticket prices, the lowering or
  ending of ticket concessions and initiatives that require season-ticket
  holders to attend a certain number of games each season or risk losing their
  place, as examples of this trend. According to Greatrex, the effects are being
  felt in some grounds. “The number of people who are there almost to experience
  something which they’re not necessarily part of has tipped into a significant
  proportion to the extent that it undermines the thing they’re going there to
  experience,” he says. “There is a real danger that in a short-term push for
  increased revenue from matchday tickets and associated spend that clubs are in
  danger of actually undermining the whole ‘product’ they’re so proud of.” One
  topic that crystallises the anxiety over expendability is that of matches
  being selected for TV. There will be more televised games than ever this
  season, with Sky showing a minimum 215 Premier League fixtures. With each
  televised match comes possible rescheduling and a potentially challenging (or
  even impossible) journey for fans. “There can be very very short-notice
  changes, which make it very difficult for people to be able to attend those
  matches. I don’t think there’s been enough focus on things that could be done
  to mitigate some of the frustration that comes from those changes.” The FSA
  has called for a 12-week notice period on fixture rearrangements, the
  provision of more “football special” trains and the extension of the £30 cap
  on away tickets into the EFL. The Premier League has committed to giving six
  weeks’ notice of fixture adjustments on all matches until January, but last
  month had to apologise after failing to meet its own deadline of announcing
  all September adjustments by 9 July. It is striking that the mood among fans
  is so febrile at the time the government has passed legislation designed, in
  part, to give supporters more influence over their clubs. Fan consultation is
  a central requirement of the new Independent Football Regulator for the
  English men’s elite game and legislation is, in part, the result of long-term
  campaigning by the FSA. It is not a panacea and its influence is unlikely to
  take hold for some seasons yet, but Greatrex, a former Labour MP, believes it
  can form a platform for better understanding between fans, clubs and
  competitions. “More than ever, there is an appreciation – among some, it’s
  reluctant, but among others, it’s embraced – that supporters have a legitimate
  voice that deserves to be heard and their views to be considered,” he says.
  “[The regulator] is actually the basis for a much more constructive approach,
  which means that if clubs are sensible you can prevent a lot of the
  flashpoints getting to the point at which they become high profile, because
  you’ve dealt with it sensibly ahead of that time.” Clarke would much rather
  have dialogue than protest. “I don’t want to be doing another protest all my
  life,” he says. “I know there’s no easy answers but a lot of this protest
  energy has come because people feel they’re not being listened to. That’s
  where the anger comes from.”
