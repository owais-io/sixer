  The chief executive of the Royal Albert Hall has apologised to an 81-year-old
  concertgoer who was stopped from entering the auditorium because he had a
  Palestine flag pin in the lapel of his blazer. Roger Cauthery and his wife,
  Angele, from north London, were attending a BBC Proms concert at the venue in
  Kensington last Friday featuring the pianist Yunchan Lim performing
  Rachmaninov. After the couple showed their tickets and had their bags searched
  in the foyer, two contractor staff spotted the lapel pin and said he would not
  be allowed into the concert because he was wearing it. One of them asked a
  colleague stationed at one of the entry doors to the auditorium not to let
  Cauthery in. The couple were left standing in the foyer for 15 minutes before
  a supervisor arrived, overruled the earlier decision and said the couple could
  attend the concert after all. “We felt extremely upset, not to say humiliated,
  by their behaviour towards us. I’m a middle-class ex-public school boy brought
  up to believe that Brits are decent and law abiding and that one can live
  one’s life freely,” Cauthery said. “I was merely showing solidarity with the
  Palestinian people and expressing my support for what I believe, and the UN
  believes, is a legitimate state. My wife and I feel strongly that Palestine
  should be recognised as a state and indeed it seems that our government is
  finally about to do so. “I have lived in London all my adult life and am very
  proud of the diversity of my city. It is tragic that this small pin badge
  should be seen as a threat to the Royal Albert Hall which surely should be one
  of the symbols of our democracy. The result of this incident was that we were
  too distressed to enjoy the concert and left at the interval.” After being
  contacted by the Guardian, James Ainscough, the chief executive of the Royal
  Albert Hall, issued an apology to the couple. He said: “I have written to
  apologise to Mr and Mrs Cauthery, who were initially halted at the door on
  Friday by one of our contractors. This isn’t in line with our policy and was a
  mistake. The duty manager who stepped in to resolve the situation was correct
  to authorise their subsequent entrance. “As well as writing to apologise for
  an experience that was understandably upsetting and humiliating, we have
  offered a full refund and an invitation to return to the hall as our guests,
  so we can give the couple the warm welcome that was sadly lacking on Friday.
  “We have also spoken to our contractor to ensure that a similar situation
  doesn’t arise again.” Cauthery said he would donate the refunded ticket fee to
  the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians, which Ainscough said was “laudable”.
  In a letter of apology to the couple, Ainscough said: “Music has an enduring
  power to bring people together, and we want the Hall to offer a warm welcome
  to all who come to enjoy our concerts. It is very sad to think that your
  experience with us on Friday was the very opposite of that. I do hope you will
  consider returning to the hall in the near future so we have an opportunity to
  give you the warm welcome you should expect.” Cauthery said: “I’m very
  grateful to RAH for responding in this way. Of course we will continue to go
  and enjoy concerts there.”
