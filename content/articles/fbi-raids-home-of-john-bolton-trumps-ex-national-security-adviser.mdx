  The FBI raided the home of Donald Trump’s former national security adviser
  turned critic John Bolton early on Friday morning and later also turned up at
  Bolton’s office. The federal search of Bolton’s house in the Washington DC
  area was understood to be part of an investigation involving the handling of
  classified documents, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar
  with the matter. A government source confirmed the raid to the Guardian, but
  did not disclose further details. The FBI director, Kash Patel, posted a
  cryptic message on X on Friday morning, saying: “NO ONE is above the law… @FBI
  agents on mission.” Bolton was not at his house in Bethesda, Maryland, when
  agents arrived but later in the morning he was seen standing in the lobby of
  the building in Washington where he keeps an office, and was talking to two
  people with FBI visible on their vests. Bolton’s wife Gretchen was seen
  leaving their home while agents were present. Bolton, also formerly a US
  ambassador to the United Nations, fell out with Donald Trump during his first
  administration and was ousted from the post of national security adviser in
  2019. He wrote a political memoir that prompted an investigation and a
  government lawsuit over whether he had misused classified information, but
  those actions ultimately went nowhere. Bolton and Trump have maintained a
  political feud ever since. On Friday morning, Trump talked to reporters and
  said: “I’m not a fan of John Bolton. He’s a real sort of a lowlife. He’s not a
  smart guy. But he could be very unpatriotic. I’m going to find out.” The
  president added that he did not know the raid was planned and that he expected
  to be briefed by the justice department later. “I tell the group I don’t want
  to know, but just you have to do what you have to do. I don’t want to know
  about it,” Trump said. JD Vance, the US vice-president, reposted Patel’s
  message, as did Dan Bongino, the deputy director of the FBI. Bongino added:
  “Public corruption will not be tolerated.” Chiming with the cryptic style of
  such comments, the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, later posted: “America’s
  safety isn’t negotiable. Justice will be pursued. Always.” No details have
  been released of any specific allegations underlying the federal court warrant
  that would have been needed to conduct such a search. The raid began at about
  7am ET and was first reported by the New York Post. At that time Bolton, when
  reached by CNN, said he was not aware of the law enforcement activity, but he
  did not issue further comment or a statement. Bolton served as national
  security adviser – Trump’s third – for 17 months and clashed with him over
  Iran, Afghanistan and North Korea. The administration then unsuccessfully
  sought to block the publication of his memoir. After a judge ruled, in June
  2020, that the book could be published, Trump said Bolton “must pay a very big
  price for this, as others have before him”. Bolton was not detained or charged
  with any crimes during the raid. On his first day back in office this year,
  Trump revoked the security clearances of more than four dozen former
  intelligence officials, including Bolton. Bolton was also among a trio of
  former Trump officials whose security details were canceled by Trump earlier
  this year. Bolton’s book The Room Where It Happened detailed his time as
  national security adviser. He detailed what he described as impeachable
  conduct and accused Trump of asking China to help secure his re-election.
  Bolton depicted a president ignorant of basic geopolitical realities,
  including not understanding that Finland was an independent country. The book
  became a bestseller despite Trump’s attempts to ban its publication. In recent
  days, Bolton has been critical of Trump’s handling of the Russia-Ukraine war.
  After a Trump-Putin meeting in Alaska failed to yield progress on ending the
  war, Bolton wrote on social media: “It’s clear that Putin got to Trump, most
  likely convincing him away from Zelensky non-negotiables like security
  guarantees.” On Thursday he criticized Trump again, writing: “Putin’s KGB
  training and flattery campaign is working Trump over.” Meghan Hays, a former
  White House special adviser to Joe Biden, told CNN in an interview that the
  raid “seems extremely political, extremely petty”, and that it smacked of
  “pure revenge” on the part of Trump and was a “poor use of FBI resources”.
  Roger Stone, a longtime political operative who was prosecuted during the
  Russia investigation and later pardoned by Trump, posted on social media:
  “Good morning. John Bolton. How does it feel to have your home raided at 6
  o’clock in the morning?” Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat
  representing Illinois, said in an interview on CNN that he thought the Bolton
  raid was designed as a distraction from the simmering saga of files from the
  federal investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who moved in
  high-level, bipartisan political circles. Krishnamoorthi sits on the House
  oversight committee, which was due on Friday to receive hundreds of documents
  about Epstein from the justice department as a result of a subpoena. Early on
  Friday afternoon, the FBI were still at Bolton’s house on a residential
  Bethesda street. Bolton had yet to comment and has not been apprehended or
  charged with any crimes.
