  plastic pollution’ could bring

  Good morning. Not only does plastic waste clog up waterways, beaches and
  strangle sea life, it also causes havoc inside the human body. Tiny fragments
  – invisible to the human eye – are probably swimming around your lungs, blood
  and liver right now. This represents a “growing and underrecognised danger” to
  human health, the latest report in the Lancet warns, as 10 days of tense talks
  kick off in Geneva today, with 179 countries due to hash out a kind of “Paris
  agreement for plastic pollution”. These talks – which have been going on since
  2022 – have been dogged by deep disagreements. More than 100 nations want a
  legally binding cap on plastic production, while petrostates want to keep
  things vague, and maybe promise to, errrrr, do some more recycling, perhaps?
  It’s possible talks will collapse with no reference to cuts to plastic
  production. I spoke to the Guardian’s environment correspondent Sandra Laville
  about why the sixth (and hopefully final) round of talks are likely to be so
  fraught and what a good deal could look like. Five big stories Weather | Gusts
  of more than 100mph from Storm Floris have brought travel disruption, power
  cuts and the widespread cancellation of events across large parts of the UK.
  Disruption to the rail network in Scotland is expected until around 4pm on
  Tuesday, ScotRail has said. UK news | A member of the House of Lords urged
  ministers to crack down on Palestine Action at the request of a US defence
  company that employs him as an adviser. Police are planning to arrest anyone
  demonstrating in support of Palestine Action this weekend. Politics | The
  Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is not telling the truth about the “real
  failures of 14 years of Conservative government”, the former Conservative
  prime minister Liz Truss has said. Tommy Robinson | The far-right activist
  known as Tommy Robinson has been arrested by British police on suspicion of
  grievous bodily harm after a man was allegedly assaulted at a London railway
  station. Gaza | More than 100 critically ill and injured children in Gaza hope
  to come to the UK as soon as possible after the government announced a scheme
  to provide those in severe need with NHS care. In depth: 10 days, 179
  countries and one critical quest to reach a global treaty on plastic The
  United Nations agreed to create a treaty on plastic in 2022. Since then, five
  separate negotiations have failed to secure an agreement. Initially, the idea
  was for the treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics, but plans have
  since been watered down. The last round of talks – held in Busan, South Korea
  – broke down at the end of last year. “There was some concern we wouldn’t even
  get another meeting,” says Sandra Laville. Country representatives are
  resuming today for 10 days of talks in Switzerland. Although plastic is often
  seen as a cheap material, it’s expensive when you factor in the cost of
  cleaning up the damage it causes – the latest report found it is responsible
  for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages. And almost all
  plastic is made from fossil oil and gas. Producing all of this plastic results
  in greater emissions than those produced by Russia – the world’s
  fourth-largest polluter. According to the University of Oxford’s Our World in
  Data, plastic production has increased sharply over the past 70 years. In
  1950, the world was producing two million tonnes of plastic to more than 450m
  tonnes today. Less than 10% of the world’s plastic is recycled, and more than
  40% is stuck in landfill. “Single-use plastic is the big earner for lots of
  companies and the petrochemical industry,” says Sandra. There were a record
  220 fossil fuel and chemic industry lobbyists at the December talks in Busan.
  That was far more than even the host nation’s delegation of 140 and was three
  times the number of independent scientists. Hotel and flight costs make the
  treaty negotiations expensive to attend, which is why rich industrial
  interests can flood the talks with lobbyists while smaller countries,
  scientists and NGOs struggle to find the funds. *** Why is this such a
  pressing problem for human health? Plastic is, in many ways, a wonder
  material, but the most rapid increase in production is for single-use
  plastics, things such as drinks bottles and fast-food packaging, which we
  sometimes use for a matter of minutes before chucking away. This sort of
  plastic may be a big earner for companies, but it is not essential for human
  wellbeing, and the drawbacks are significant. The latest review, published in
  the leading medical journal the Lancet, was carried out by leading health
  researchers and doctors. They found plastics cause disease and death from
  infancy to old age because they are laced in more than 16,000 chemicals such
  as fillers, dyes, flame retardants and stabilisers which have been known to
  damage human health. The most vulnerable in society are the most at risk. The
  analysis found that foetuses and infants were subject to harms such as
  increased risks of miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, impaired lung
  growth, childhood cancer and fertility problems later in life. *** What are
  delegates going to achieve? There are two groups battling it out in Geneva.
  One is comprised of more than 100 countries – including the EU – which support
  legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the phasing out of
  single-use plastic products. The other camp are countries with large fossil
  fuel industries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, who say they don’t
  want any suggestion of tackling plastic production. The latter group want the
  agreement to focus on better management and recycling of waste, and for
  countries to implement voluntary or national measures. “Countries such as
  Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China have moved the discussion away from production
  towards, ‘Oh we just need to manage the waste better, oh we just need to
  recycle more’,” says Sandra. Since 2022, these divisions have become more
  entrenched. Countries such as Egypt and Malaysia have plastic industry
  representatives in their national delegations. Meanwhile, the 100
  high-ambition countries are not going to fold – the evidence shows we have to
  reduce plastic production to reduce pollution. “That’s why it all collapsed in
  Busan in December,” says Sandra. The nature of any agreement is still up the
  air – it’s possible a meaningful treaty will be agreed, or they have further
  meetings, or some countries agree to pursue a “coalition of the willing”
  treaty outside the UN. Greenpeace is calling for at least a 75% reduction in
  plastic production by 2040. But if an agreement can be reached, it would be
  the equivalent of getting the Paris agreement for climate negotiations. “You
  can argue the Paris agreement hasn’t done much, but there has been an
  agreement, and we just haven’t had one on plastic pollution. So this is the
  kind of vacuum that needs to be filled,” says Sandra. *** What does this say
  about international environmental diplomacy? “I think there was this real
  optimism in 2022 when the idea of a treaty was agreed,” says Sandra.
  Scientists were saying that getting a good agreement could be a gamechanger
  for cutting plastic pollution. But the winds appear to have changed. “By last
  November that optimism had all gone.” The US – which is the world’s
  second-largest producer of plastic after China – has flip-flopped positions
  during negotiations, but now appears to be aligned with other major fossil
  fuel producers and is supporting the least ambitious option. China and Iran
  are also among the countries looking for less ambition, an option they
  describe as “realistic”. It comes as the Trump administration in the US rolls
  back environmental policies, including a longstanding finding on greenhouse
  gas emissions endangering health. Andrés del Castillo, senior attorney at the
  Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a non profit providing
  legal counsel to some countries attending the talks, said oil states were
  questioning even basic facts about the harm to health caused by plastics. “We
  are in a moment of revisionism, where even science is highly politicised,” he
  says. Hopes for a “last-chance” ambitious global treaty to curb plastic
  pollution are looking dim – but a weaker agreement still shows international
  diplomacy functions. “It doesn’t feel as if the world is ready to address any
  of this,” says Sandra. “I do think that any treaty – as long as it’s not
  really weak – is a good thing to hold up.” What else we’ve been reading Nels

  time and energy to cook meant that a lot of food got chucked in the compost
  bin. But last summer, while auditing her overall spending, she also started
  growing a few vegetables. “It was as if a switch had been flicked in my mind –
  as if it had taken the idea of growing my own food to truly understand the
  value and timescale of food production,” she writes. She committed to using up
  every scrap of uneaten food and became more flexible about following recipes.
  Apples in a curry? Yes, please. Leftover roast potatoes with spaghetti?
  Delicious. It hasn’t been without what she terms “flavour disasters”, but she
  has found the challenge has made her less ambitious but more creative. “Best
  of all,” Wilkinson writes, “I’ve rediscovered what I loved about cooking in
  the first place: the joy of making something delicious out of almost nothing.”
