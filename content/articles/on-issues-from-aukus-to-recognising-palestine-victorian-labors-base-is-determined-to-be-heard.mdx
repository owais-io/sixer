  Scrap Aukus. Recognise Palestine. Save public housing. Overhaul childcare. On
  paper, the urgency resolutions up for debate at Victorian Labor’s state
  conference this weekend lay out a roadmap for progressive, nation-shaping
  reform. But how much sway do grassroots members and unions really have on the
  increasingly cautious federal and state Labor governments? The premier,
  Jacinta Allan, on Wednesday, said the conference provides the “policies and
  programs that shape the Labor agenda of the future”. But then, when some of
  the proposed policies became public a day later, she was quick to distance her
  government. “It’s government that sets policy,” she said on Thursday.
  Rank-and-file party members spend months of their own time drafting the
  urgency resolutions, or motions, lobbying for votes and hoping that – while
  non-binding – their proposals influence the party’s direction. But many say
  that since state conference returned in 2023 – after a four-year gap marked by
  lockdowns and a federal intervention in the branch – it’s started to feel a
  bit like political theatre. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “It’s all a big,
  stage-managed performance really,” one Labor member says, claiming most
  controversial motions are vetted in advance by the premier, prime minister or
  relevant ministers’ office, with their wording softened and criticisms
  blunted. Another member says there’s a “strange paradigm” at play, where
  ministerial staff “sometimes dismiss the backbone of the movement” while at
  the same time “put so much effort into making sure conference is clean”. (That
  is, no public bust-ups or headlines that might cause trouble for the
  government). Some Labor MPs who have been around for decades insist it’s just
  the way it has always been. “It’s just that we’ve come off a federal election
  win and everyone is ambitious to set the agenda,” one state MP said. Indeed,
  this weekend’s gathering at Moonee Valley racecourse marks the first major
  meeting of Labor party members since the federal election. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, won’t be in attendance, leaving Allan to rally the room of
  600 delegates, split evenly between party members and affiliated unions. The
  delegate mix will lean more progressive this year, partly due to the Health
  Workers Union sitting it out and the CFMEU being unable to participate, making
  it easier for some motions to get across the line. (Though one state Labor MP
  quipped that the party was “always more progressive than the government, just
  as the Liberal party conference is more conservative”). On the draft agenda,
  there are two motions calling for a review of the Aukus submarine deal,
  including one from Labor Against War, which urges a withdrawal from the
  partnership, citing the US president, Donald Trump, as a “clear and present
  danger to peace and security”. “We shouldn’t rely on the unstable Trump
  administration for our defence … Victoria must ensure we are protected from
  Trump’s chaos and division,” it reads. The group is optimistic it will pass.
  Two motions deal with the childcare crisis, sparked by allegations of child
  sexual abuse against a Victorian worker, with one calling for stricter
  staffing ratios, tighter regulation and funding reform to “restrict and
  eliminate profiteering”. The other proposes a centralised Working With
  Children Check database, real-time alerts, psychometric testing for workers
  and the creation of a childcare worker integrity unit. There’s a motion
  rejecting the Allan government’s proposed protest laws, arguing they “would
  serve only to stifle freedom of expression” and are “anti-democratic and
  regressive”. Labor for Housing is also pushing the state government to commit
  to keep all 44 public housing tower sites slated for redevelopment publicly
  owned. “If this resolution is endorsed by conference it is a clear and
  unambiguous statement that the Labor government does not have the support of
  its movement to sell the land,” Julijana Todorovic, the Labor for Housing
  co-convener and co-founder says. “We have an opportunity to tell a good story
  about Labor’s value for public assets and ensuring wealth is shared by all
  Victorians.” Todorovic said while the motion isn’t binding “it would be
  extraordinary for a government to act contrary to the will of those it will
  rely on to get re-elected next year”. A pointed warning. The sentiment is
  shared by the unions, which provide much of the party’s volunteer base. The
  Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union and the Health and Community Services
  Union are calling on the state government to follow through on past
  commitments – including a $12m 2022 election pledge to deliver a worker-led
  drug, alcohol and gambling service that, three years on, “remains unopened,
  with no confirmed land, construction or seed funding”. Tony Piccolo from the
  AMWU said unions “work very hard with their members to generate very good
  ideas to bring to conference” only for some to “sit on a shelf” for years.
  “You would think with the state debt level so high that unions offering to
  fund a health initiative would be embraced as it helps budgetary pressures.”
  Most anticipated though are motions put forward by Labor Friends of Palestine
  demanding the federal government “immediately” recognise a Palestinian state
  and impose sanctions on Israel – their strongest push to date on the issue.
  The issue flared up at last year’s conference, with protesters attempting to
  storm the building. Security has been ramped up this year as a result, with
  another protest planned for Saturday. This year’s conference is also firmly
  focused on policy, with committees submitting final reports that will help
  shape Victorian Labor’s 2026 election platform. Proposals include replacing
  stamp duty with an annual land tax, introducing a new tax on land sale
  super-profits, establishing a state-owned and regulated cannabis industry,
  mandating 12 days of reproductive health leave per year and creating a
  political disinformation register. But the reports show few, if any,
  ministers, parliamentary secretaries or caucus representatives actually showed
  up at committee meetings, raising questions about how seriously they’re
  treated within government ranks. If the mood on the ground is anything to go
  by, the base is no longer willing to be sidelined. Benita Kolovos is Guardian
