  Reflecting on the impact of the BBC drama series Play for Today, for which he
  was a producer and director in the late 1970s, Richard Eyre described its
  weekly broadcast as a “social occasion” that was hard to ignore. “You could
  resent it, you could look forward to it,” he commented in a book chronicling
  the series’ early years, “but it had a place in the broad cultural life of the
  nation.” In a fragmented landscape transformed by streamers and social media,
  many modern writers and directors can only dream of that kind of influence for
  their work. Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, was an
  exception. But the globalising tendencies, and rising costs, of the Netflix
  age have made it increasingly hard for public service broadcasters to produce
  original programming with a distinctively British feel and focus. ITV’s Mr
  Bates vs the Post Office made a £1m loss, and Mark Rylance took a pay cut to
  ensure that the second series of the BBC’s Wolf Hall actually got made. Three
  cheers, then, for Channel 5’s bold move to bring back Play for Today, more
  than 40 years after it left our screens in 1984. The channel has announced it
  will revive the brand from early next year, with an emphasis on the social
  realism that was an important feature of the original series. Some established
  stars such as Alan Davies and Sue Johnston are on board. But the plays are
  also intended to offer a springboard for young writers and actors from
  lower-income backgrounds – a welcome emphasis in an industry that is
  increasingly inaccessible to working-class talent. They will be aspiring to
  replicate one of the most successful experiments in the history of British
  television. In an era when producers, directors and writers enjoyed
  considerable freedom and trust, Play for Today offered some of the country’s
  finest creative spirits a prime-time Thursday-night slot. The extensive list
  of famous alumni includes Dennis Potter, Helen Mirren, Stephen Frears, Ken
  Loach, Alison Steadman and Trevor Griffiths. Hopefully, the revived version
  will offer greater room for female talent to flourish. Reflecting its time,
  the production process of Play for Today was very much a man’s world. But 14
  years’ worth of plays, some of them adapted from the stage, allowed names to
  be made and often gritty themes to be addressed. David Edgar’s acclaimed
  Destiny, which examined the rise of the British far right in the late 1970s,
  was one of a number of sobering takes on the state of the nation. Abigail’s
  Party, Mike Leigh’s tragicomic portrait of suburban social anxiety, still
  delights theatre audiences today. The days when the executives in charge of
  only three television channels decided what people watched belong to a
  different age. Next year’s reboot will face daunting competition for the
  public’s attention. But at a time when British politics feels particularly
  fissile, and opinions reverberate around social media echo chambers, a
  televisual space in which difficult subjects can be creatively addressed would
  be a national asset. A few years ago, Channel 5 scored a big hit when it
  faithfully remade All Creatures Great and Small, the cosy adaptation of James
  Herriot’s vet novels originally broadcast from 1978. In tone and content, the
  new Play for Today will strike a rather different note from that pastoral
  reprise. But this is another revival that deserves to succeed. Do you have an
