  The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and the US vice-president, JD Vance,
  held a meeting with Ukrainian and European partners in Britain on Saturday to
  discuss the drive for peace in Ukraine. The summit comes before a meeting
  between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin set for next Friday in Alaska. In a
  comment that that was met with pushback from Kyiv, the US president said that
  an end to the war must involve “some swapping of territories”. The Ukrainian
  president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stressed early on Saturday that “Ukrainians
  will not give their land to occupiers”. Trump has agreed to meet the Russian
  president even if he refuses to meet Zelenskyy, adding to fears Ukraine could
  be sidelined in negotiations. A White House official said later on Saturday
  that Trump was open to holding a trilateral summit in Alaska with Putin and
  Zelenskyy, but that it was planning a bilateral meeting with Putin at the
  Russian’s president’s request. In a Telegram post on Saturday in which he
  emphasised Kyiv must be represented for any peace deal to be viable, Zelenskyy
  wrote: “Any decisions that are without Ukraine are at the same time decisions
  against peace. They will not bring anything. These are dead decisions. They
  will never work.” The meeting between Lammy and Vance took place at Chevening
  in Kent. The Guardian understands it was held at the request of the US. On
  Saturday evening, Lammy posted on X that he had held a meeting with Vance,
  Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Rustem
  Umerov, Ukraine’s defence minister, and European national security advisers.
  “The UK’s support for Ukraine remains ironclad as we continue working towards
  a just and lasting peace,” he said. Zelenskyy said on Saturday evening that
  the meeting of security advisers from Ukraine and its partner countries had
  been constructive, adding that Kyiv’s arguments were heard and dangers were
  taken into account. Zelenskyy said officials from Britain, the United States,
  France, Germany, Italy, Finland and Poland took part in the meeting, aiming to
  consolidate positions to achieve a ceasefire. “The path to peace for Ukraine
  should be determined together and only together with Ukraine, this is key
  principle,” he said in his evening address. On Saturday evening the leaders of
  the UK, France, Italy, Germany, Poland and Finland, and the president of the
  EU Commission, released a joint statement declaring that the path to peace
  could not be decided without Ukraine. “We welcome President Trump’s work to
  stop the killing in Ukraine, end the Russian Federation’s war of aggression,
  and achieve just and lasting peace and security for Ukraine,” they said. “We
  are convinced that only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to
  Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can
  succeed. “We stand ready to support this work diplomatically as well as by
  upholding our substantive military and financial support to Ukraine.” On
  Saturday morning Starmer and Zelenskyy had talked by phone. A No 10
  spokesperson said: “Both leaders welcomed president Trump’s desire to bring
  this barbaric war to an end and agreed that we must keep up the pressure on
  Putin to end his illegal war.” The statement added that Starmer had reiterated
  “his unwavering support for Ukraine and its people” during the call. Zelenskyy
  communicated with Trump and European leaders in recent days as news broke that
  the US leader and Putin were planning to meet. On Friday Poland’s prime
  minister, Donald Tusk, said there could be a “freeze” in the conflict. If the
  summit goes ahead between Trump and Putin, it will be the first time a US
  president has met the Russian leader since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine
  in February 2022. The last meeting Putin had with a US president was with Joe
  Biden in Geneva in June 2021.
