  More film-makers are calling on Mubi, the upstart distributor which ushered
  The Substance to box office success and awards acclaim last year, to end its
  relationship with an investment firm with close ties to the Israeli military.
  A letter strongly criticizing the buzzy distribution company’s funding from
  the investor Sequoia Capital now has 63 signatures from creatives who have
  either made films released by Mubi, featured on its platform or acted in a
  project tied to the company. Radu Jude, Aki Kaurismäki, Miguel Gomes, Sarah
  Friedland, Joshua Oppenheimer and Cherien Dabis were among the first to sign
  the letter, first published by Variety on 30 July. More followed, including
  the Israeli directors Ari Folman (Waltz with Bashir) and Nadav Lapid
  (Synonyms, Ahed’s Knee); Amalia Ulman, whose second feature Magic Farm was
  released by Mubi earlier this year; and Alex Russell, whose debut feature
  Lurker was acquired by Mubi out of Sundance for release later this month. The
  backlash stems from an announcement in May that Mubi – which recently went on
  a buying spree at the Cannes film festival, acquiring the rights to Jennifer
  Lawrence and Robert Pattinson movie Die My Love – had secured $100m in funding
  from Sequoia Capital. The Silicon Valley-based investment firm has poured
  money into a range of companies, from Apple to Google to Cisco, but Mubi
  marked a rare foray into entertainment. At issue is its investment in and
  continued ties to Kela, a defense tech firm founded by four veterans of the
  Israeli military in July 2024, more than six months after Israel’s invasion of
  Gaza, which has killed more than 60,000 people and led to humanitarian
  catastrophe. Kela is currently developing a battlefield operating system
  enabling militaries to integrate AI with commercial technology. According to
  Sequoia’s website, it led Kela’s $10m seed funding last year. This spring,
  Kela secured an additional $60m in a funding round led by Sequoia, Lux Capital
  and In-Q-Tel, the investment arm of the CIA. “Mubi’s financial growth as a
  company is now explicitly tied to the genocide in Gaza, which implicates all
  of us that work with Mubi,” the letter reads. “We too believe that cinema can
  be powerful. And we know that we can’t always control how audiences will
  respond to our work, and whether or not it will move and inspire them. But we
  can control how our work reflects our values and commitments – ones that are
  wholly ignored when our work is brought into alliance with a
  genocide-profiteering private equity firm.” It continued: “We don’t believe an
  arthouse film platform can meaningfully support a global community of
  cinephiles while also partnering with a company invested in murdering
  Palestinian artists and film-makers.” Mubi has yet to respond publicly to the
  letter. In the wake of social media backlash over its ties to Sequoia, a
  message on the company’s social media channels said the rationale for the
  investment was to “accelerate our mission of delivering bold and visionary
  films to global audiences”, and that the venture firm had a “50-plus year
  history of partnering with founders to help turn their ideas into
  world-changing businesses”. “Over the last several days, some members of our
  community have commented on the decision to work with Sequoia given their
  investment in Israeli companies and the personal opinions expressed by one of
  their partners,” it said. “The beliefs of individual investors do not reflect
  the views of Mubi.” Signatories of the letter called on Mubi to take the three
  steps demanded by Film Workers for Palestine, an international collective that
  claims to represent more than 9,000 industry workers: publicly condemn Sequoia
  Capital for “genocide profiteering”; remove Sequoia partner Andrew Reed from
  Mubi’s board of directors; and instate an ethical policy for all future Mubi
  investments. The signatories also called on Mubi to respect guidelines on
  programming and partnerships set by the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic
  and Cultural Boycott of Israel). The letter follows international backlash to
  Mubi’s ties to Sequoia, with multiple venues and programming partners around
  the world announcing the end of their partnerships or the cancellation of
  events. Glasgow’s Centre for Contemporary Arts, Mexico City’s Cineteca
  Nacional and the Cinemateca de Bogotá all pulled out of Mubi Fest, a
  multi-continent film festival initially planned to take place in 12 cities.
  Last week, the Valdivia film festival in Chile said it would not screen any
  film distributed by Mubi, with the festival director attributing that decision
  to funding from Sequoia. “We realized that Mubi has truly voided the position
  it once held as a bastion for independent creatives and audiences in the
  industry,” the organization Girls in Film said of their decision to end a
  seven-year programming partnership with Mubi. “Mubi as a company has
  considered the trade-off between commercial growth and the livelihoods of the
  marginalized and downtrodden, and chosen growth.” Additionally, the film-maker
  Eddie Huang said in an Instagram post that Mubi had “shelved” his documentary,
  Vice Is Broke, after he spoke out against the Sequoia investment. The director
  claimed that Mubi wanted to make an “example” out of him after he protested
  about its ties to the destruction of Gaza and decided to sit out Mubi’s
  promotion of his film. In response, a Mubi spokesman said that the film was
  not shelved, and that the company was in “constructive discussions” with Huang
  on its release. The backlash comes as the situation in Gaza has passed several
  milestones, with many Palestinians facing mass starvation. Last week, the
  Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, a panel of experts from the UN
  and other aid organizations, confirmed that “the worst-case scenario of famine
  is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,” due to Israel’s continuedsevere
  restrictions on aid, leading to “catastrophic human suffering”. The Guardian
  has reached out to Mubi for comment.
