  The closely watched New York mayoral and governor’s races appear to be forming
  into shapes that will bring little comfort to centrist Democrats, with
  elections happening in November this year in New York City and the
  gubernatorial vote a year later. A new Siena Institute poll released on
  Tuesday shows New York City’s Democratic socialist mayoral candidate, Zohran
  Mamdani, leading former New York governor Andrew Cuomo by 19 percentage points
  – while the Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik is chipping away at
  incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul’s lead in a hypothetical contest for the New
  York governor’s mansion in 2026. Hochul’s lead over Stefanik, who was
  nominated to be US ambassador to the United Nations before withdrawing to help
  Republicans maintain a majority in Congress, has now dropped from 23 points in
  June to 14 points. Stefanik has not officially decided on whether to seek the
  governor’s office, but she has been noticeably attacking Hochul’s record. The
  poll found that 49% of voters in the state said it would be bad for New York
  if Stefanik were elected governor. “The latest Siena poll is catastrophic for
  Kathy Hochul as she is losing independent voters to Elise Stefanik, is below
  50% on the ballot, and only 35% of voters want to re-elect Kathy Hochul,” said
  Stefanik’s executive director Alex deGrasse in a statement to the Guardian. He
  predicted voters are looking to Stefanik to deliver new leadership.
  “Chairwoman Elise Stefanik will continue to focus on providing results such as
  delivering the largest middle class tax cut in New York history. She will
  repeal Kathy Hochul’s failed bail reform and dangerous sanctuary cities
  policies and cut taxes for New Yorkers,” deGrasse added. In the mayoral race,
  the poll found 44% of registered New York City voters backing Mamdani,
  followed by 25% for Cuomo, 12% for the Republican party nominee, Curtis Sliwa,
  and only 7% for the incumbent mayor, Eric Adams. However, Cuomo leads among
  Black and Jewish voters, two groups that Mamdani underperforms with. But
  Mamdani holds a towering lead with younger voters, leading Cuomo by 49% among
  voters aged 18 to 34 but trailing Cuomo by 6% among voters 55 years and older.
  Mamdani is the Democratic party candidate in the race. Cuomo and Adams – who
  are both Democrats – are running as independents. Tuesday’s poll also signaled
  that outside New York City, surveyed voters have a negative impression of
  Mamdani, with 37% having an unfavorable opinion and 28% positive. But Cuomo
  scored lower, with 61% of voters polled statewide holding a poor impression.
  Yet leading centrist New York Democrats, including the US Senate minority
  leader, Chuck Schumer, US House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, and Hochul
  have yet to throw their weight behind Mamdani. “We still have many
  differences,” Hochul said two days earlier on Fox News Sunday. “I don’t know
  how you whitewash that away.” But she said she was willing to work with
  “whoever the voters elect” in New York City. On Monday, Mamdani kicked off a
  week-long tour titled Five Boroughs Against Trump, highlighting what he
  maintains are the dangers posed to the city by the presidential
  administration. Cuomo, meanwhile, is attempting to highlight what he sees as a
  flaw in Mamdani’s position on the key issue of housing and affordability.
  Cuomo’s campaign has pitched a state law to keep the rich out of
  rent-stabilized apartments that it calls “Zohran’s Law”. Cuomo has been
  bashing his rival for living in a $2,300 rent-stabilized, one-bedroom while
  making more than $140,000 a year as a state assemblymember. Cuomo proposed
  that rent-stabilized apartments should go to individuals who pay no less than
  30% of their income in rent to qualify. The Mamdani campaign has said their
  candidate would have met this standard when he moved in and was earning
  $47,000 a year. Mamdani responded to Cuomo’s accusation that he is too wealthy
  for his rent-stabilized apartment on Monday, saying: “I live rent-free in his
  head.” The Mamdani campaign also hit back in a video with insinuations of
  links between Cuomo and Jeffrey Epstein, the late disgraced financier who
  pleaded guilty in Florida to charges of prostitution and solicitation of
  prostitution with a minor in 2008. The video demanded that Cuomo release his
  list of consulting clients, noting the ex-governor once worked on a yacht
  marina project in Puerto Rico with Andrew Farkas, a former partner of Epstein
  on Caribbean marinas.
