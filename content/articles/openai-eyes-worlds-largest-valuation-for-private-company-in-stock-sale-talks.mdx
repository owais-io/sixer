  The maker of ChatGPT is on the cusp of becoming the world’s most valuable
  private company. OpenAI is in talks to sell $6bn in shares, which would boost
  its valuation to $500bn, according to multiple reports. The artificial
  intelligence startup’s stock would be sold to investors by current and former
  employees. OpenAI has seen exponential growth over the past year. Investors,
  including Microsoft and SoftBank, have poured at least $40bn into the startup,
  giving it a valuation of $300bn as of March. Last October, it was valued at
  $157bn. If OpenAI achieves a $500bn valuation, it would surpass Elon Musk’s
  SpaceX, which currently holds the title of world’s most valuable privately
  held company, at $350bn. The reported cohort of investors now eyeing OpenAI’s
  share sale include three firms that have already invested: SoftBank, Dragoneer
  Investment Group and Thrive Capital. According to Bloomberg, the talks are in
  early stages and the numbers could change. OpenAI declined to comment. OpenAI
  leads a crowded and competitive race, with the world’s most powerful companies
  battling to beat out one another on AI. Meta, Google, Amazon and Microsoft
  have all been spending enormous sums on AI development – hiring engineers and
  building datacenters. The four companies have spent a combined $155bn on AI
  development in 2025 alone. Although artificial intelligence has improved since
  the release of ChatGPT in 2022, OpenAI received a lukewarm reception at the
  debut of its latest version of the AI that underpins its chatbot, GPT-5,
  earlier this month. Users said the new AI model’s writing was worse and that
  it lacked the personality of previous iterations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has
  said his company is pursuing “artificial general intelligence”, or an AI that
  can outdo a human at most tasks, but at the recent launch, he said GPT-5 was
  “generally intelligent”, but was not yet able to “continuously learn”. AI
  companies have also been increasingly scrutinized by regulators for chatbots
  that create harmful conversations and manipulate users.
