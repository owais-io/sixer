  A statue of a general in the Confederate army that was toppled and set on fire
  during social justice protests in 2020 in Washington DC will be reinstated,
  the National Park Service (NPS) has announced. The bronze statue depicting
  Albert Pike is being restored, the Park Service said in a statement on Monday,
  sharing a photo of the statue undergoing cleaning to remove corrosion and
  paint prior to repairs, with a view to reinstalling it by October. “The
  restoration aligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation
  law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation’s capital and
  re-instate pre-existing statues,” a statement from the agency said, including
  an executive order issued by Donald Trump in March calling for “restoring
  truth and sanity to American history”. The restoration is just the latest
  action undertaken by the NPS, faced with unprecedented staff cuts and threats
  to some $1bn of its federal funding under the Trump administration, that falls
  in line with the president’s agenda to sanitize and rewrite the country’s
  history. It has come under fire in recent months for removing or editing
  content to scrub references to certain historical narratives, including
  slavery, stories of women, African Americans and LGBTQ+ individuals. It
  removed references to transgender people from its Stonewall national monument
  webpage in February, while pages about Harriet Tubman and a Black Medal of
  Honor recipient were restored after public backlash. The agency also faced
  scrutiny for directing park staff to review gift shop items for content deemed
  “anti-American”. In the wake of the police murder of George Floyd in
  Minneapolis, antiracism protestors used rope and chains to topple the Pike
  statue – the only one of a Confederate general in the nation’s capital – and
  set it ablaze on Juneteenth, the day marking the end of slavery in the US, in
  2020. Floyd’s death had sparked a nationwide reckoning with systemic racism
  which included calls for the removal of monuments to the Confederacy, more
  than 300 of which were eventually removed across the country. Trump, then in
  his first term, quickly tweeted about the toppling: “The DC police are not
  doing their job as they watched a statue be ripped down and burn. These people
  should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our country.” Several days later
  he reportedly requested that the statue be restored. This time around the
  president has tasked the Department of the Interior to look into restoring
  monuments, memorials and statues that have been removed since 2020, and the
  Pentagon has restored Confederate names to army bases (something Trump said he
  “would not even consider” in 2020). The statue had long been a source of
  controversy, as have Confederate statues and other markers of the Confederate
  legacy across the US more generally. Many were put up long after the civil war
  had ended as a way of continuing to intimidate Black Americans and serve as
  monuments to white supremacy. Pike was a longtime leader of the Freemasons, a
  centuries-old secretive society, who paid for the statue. His body is interred
  at the Washington headquarters of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, which also
  contains a small museum in his honor. The statue, dedicated in 1901, was
  located in Judiciary Square about half a mile from the US Capitol. It was
  built at the request of Masons who successfully lobbied Congress to grant them
  land for the statue as long as Pike would be depicted in civilian – not
  military – clothing. Civil rights activists and some local government
  officials in DC had campaigned for years to get the statue taken down but
  needed the federal government’s approval to do so. A proposed resolution
  calling for the removal of the statue referred to Pike as a “chief founder of
  the post-civil war Ku Klux Klan”. The Klan connection is a frequent accusation
  from Pike’s critics and one which the Masons dispute. Since NPS announced its
  plan to return the Pike statue, Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC’s House delegate,
  announced plans to reintroduce her bill to remove the statue and donate it to
  a museum. “I’ve long believed Confederate statues should be placed in museums
  as historical artifacts, not remain in parks and locations that imply honor,”
  she said in a press release. “The decision to honor Albert Pike by
  reinstalling the Pike statue is as odd and indefensible as it is morally
  objectionable. Pike served dishonorably.”
