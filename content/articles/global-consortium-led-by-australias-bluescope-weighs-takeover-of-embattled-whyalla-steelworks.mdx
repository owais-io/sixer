  Australia’s largest steelmaker, BlueScope, is part of an international
  consortium considering a takeover of the embattled Whyalla steelworks, which
  was stripped from the control of British industrialist Sanjeev Gupta earlier
  this year. A consortium consisting of the Australian steelmaker, Japan’s
  Nippon Steel, Indian company JSW Steel and South Korean manufacturer POSCO,
  has submitted a non-binding expression of interest in the South Australian
  steelworks, BlueScope told shareholders on Monday. “Any decision to make an
  offer to acquire and develop expanded operations at Whyalla would be subject
  to due diligence and the consortium members’ return on investment hurdles,”
  BlueScope said in a statement. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “The consortium
  has identified Whyalla as a prospective location for future production of
  lower emissions iron in Australia for both domestic and export markets, with
  the potential to play an important role in the decarbonisation of the global
  steelmaking industry.” POSCO led a 2017 bid to take over Whyalla, but was
  outbid by Gupta. BlueScope, which operates the Port Kembla steelworks south of
  Sydney, said there was no obligation to turn the consortium’s expression of
  interest into a formal bid. Whyalla is one of only two major integrated steel
  projects in Australia and the only local manufacturer of rail. It is seen as a
  highly sensitive project, politically, given the steelworks is a major
  employer in a regional city creating a product not made anywhere else in
  Australia. Earlier in 2025, the steelworks received a $2.4bn state and federal
  government bailout package to help keep it afloat and save jobs, after the
  South Australian government removed control from Gupta’s GFG Alliance amid
  mounting debts. GFG had pledged to decarbonise the plant, which included a
  plan to use renewable energy-produced hydrogen in the manufacturing process to
  make sought-after green steel. But the promised investment never arrived. When
  administrators were appointed in February, the steelworks was found to have
  racked up more than $1.3bn in debts, including unpaid employee entitlements. A
  GFG spokesperson said at the time the operation faced “significant operational
  and financial challenges” due to external and internal factors. Many of the
  financial problems facing Gupta’s global steel empire are linked to the 2021
  collapse of its primary financier Greensill Capital, an event that rattled his
  global steelmaking businesses, which include operations in the UK, continental
  Europe and the US. The South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, said on
  Monday that more than 15 national and international parties had passed the
  final expression-of-interest phase in a positive sign for the steelmaker’s
  transition to new ownership. The sales adviser will now solicit indicative
  bids from shortlisted parties that expressed interest, with no preferred
  bidder at this stage. “The state government’s objective has been to transition
  the ownership of the steelworks to a new credible owner who can invest in
  Whyalla’s future,” Malinauskas said in a statement. “This strong interest is a
  positive sign for the future of the Whyalla steelworks and for the future of
  sovereign steelmaking capability in Australia.”
