  Sales of Novo Nordisk’s injectable diabetes drugs including Ozempic have
  slowed sharply amid fierce competition and the threat of US tariffs, prompting
  it to cut costs and sharpen its commercial focus. The Danish drugmaker, whose
  booming sales of GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs in recent years had turned
  it into Europe’s most valuable company, has lost nearly $100bn (£75bn) in
  market value since cutting its full-year sales forecast last week, when its
  share price slid 30% in its worst week in more than two decades. It fell a
  further 3% on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said sales of medications
  such as Ozempic – which mimic the GLP-1 gut hormone that regulates blood sugar
  levels and appetite – grew by 8% in the first half of the year, down from 21%
  last year. Sales of obesity drugs including Wegovy increased by 56%, taking
  total sales 16% higher to 155bn Danish kroner (£18bn). Profit before tax
  climbed by 24% to 70.8bn kroner. The company has lost market share to its US
  rival Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro, which studies have shown to be more effective, as
  well as cheaper versions made by generic drugmakers. It has also been hit by
  “compounding” in the US, where pharmacies make up medications from
  ingredients, even though the US regulator declared an end to the practice
  recently. Novo Nordisk’s outgoing chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen,
  said that the copycat market had “equal size to our business” and that
  compounded versions of Wegovy were sold at a “much lower price point”. Its
  finance chief, Karsten Munk Knudsen, said the company was pursuing various
  strategies, including lawsuits against compounding pharmacies and expanding
  its US direct-to-consumer platform, NovoCare, launched in March. The company
  might also pursue “cash sales” directly to patients elsewhere. Jørgensen said
  Novo Nordisk was taking measures to “sharpen our commercial execution further,
  and ensure efficiencies in our cost base while continuing to invest in future
  growth”. He said it would probably not be able to avoid layoffs, but that no
  decision had been made. He said it would be up to Maziar Mike Doustdar, who
  takes over as CEO on Thursday, to make such a decision. The company is now
  expecting sales growth of between 8% and 14% at constant exchange rates in
  2025, down sharply from its previous estimate of 13% to 21%. Novo Nordisk also
  disclosed that it had ditched several weight-loss drugs in development,
  including one that has just completed an intermediate (phase II) clinical
  study, “due to portfolio considerations”. The company faces a class action
  lawsuit in the US from investors, who claim that it misled them with
  optimistic growth forecasts in the lucrative weight loss market. The UBS
  analyst Matthew Weston said: “We expect GLP-1 compounders to remain in the US,
  which limits cash-pay uptake and leaves an uncertain outlook for US Wegovy.
  “President Trump’s proposal to reimburse GLP-1 obesity in Medicare could add
  significant volume uplift, but most-favoured-nation demands to offer US cash
  sales at European prices could significantly reduce value.” Derren Nathan, the
  head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Tariffs and drug
  pricing policy are another threat Mike Doustdar will need to tackle head-on if
  one of Denmark’s greatest success stories is to regain its crown as Europe’s
  most valuable company. “The 15% blanket rate on EU imports is not necessarily
  the end of the story as Donald Trump dangles the prospect of levies of up to
  250% on pharmaceutical imports under a separate section 232 investigation.”
