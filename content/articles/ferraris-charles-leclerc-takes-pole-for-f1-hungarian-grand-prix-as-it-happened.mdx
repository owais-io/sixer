  Ok that is it from me on qualifying duty. You can follow along tomorrow’s race
  with Dominic Booth with light out at around 3pm BST. Charles Leclerc took pole
  position for the Hungarian Grand Prix for Ferrari, beating the McLarens of
  Oscar Piastri into second and third in a closely fought contest at the
  Hungaroring. It is Leclerc’s first pole in Hungary, on the occasion of his
  163rd grand prix, at a race he has still yet to win. George Russell was fourth
  for Mercedes and Fernando Alonso in fifth for Aston Martin. There was huge
  disappointment for Lewis Hamilton, however, with the seven-times champion
  knocked out in 13th place during Q2, despite showing good pace in practice.
  Read Giles Richards’ full report from qualifying below: Tough to watch Lewis
  Hamilton being interviewed on Sky after going out in Q2, he’s back on his
  self-criticism again: “I’m useless, no problem with the car, the car’s on
  pole, probably need to change driver.” Speaking after the end of Q3 both
  Piastri and Norris said the wind was a major factor in the difference in
  performance from Q1. They were slightly stunned not to be locking out the
  front row. The back of the grid will look like this: 11. Ollie Bearman (Haas)
  12. Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari) 13. Carlos Sainz (Williams) 14. Franco Colapinto
  (Alpine) 15. Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes) 16. Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) 17. Pierre
  Gasly (Alpine) 18. Esteban Ocon (Haas) 19. Nico Hulkenberg (Sauber) 20. Alex
  Albon (Williams) A bit of reaction from Leclerc after taking pole: “The whole
  qualifying has been extremely difficult and when I say that I’m not
  exaggerating. “It was super difficult for us to get to Q2 and Q3, in Q3 the
  conditions changed a little bit and everything became a lot trickier and I
  knew I had to just do a clean lap to target third. “At the end of the day it’s
  pole position and I definitely did not expect that. “I could feel [the grip
  change] a lot and I was on the lower side of the downforce so when the rain
  started in Q2 I was hoping that it wouldn’t stay there. It didn’t and the
  conditions changed which made it everything very tricky and at the end we were
  on pole position. “I honestly I have no words, it’s probably one of the best
  pole positions I’ve ever had because it’s the most unexpected for sure. On
  whether he can win tomorrow: “The start and Turn One will be key, I have no
  idea how it will go. One thing for sure is that I will do absolutely
  everything in order to keep that first place. If we manage to do that then
  that should make our life easier for the rest of the race.” 1. Charles Leclerc
  (Ferrari) - 1min 15.372secs 2. Oscar Piastri (McLaren) +0.026 3. Lando Norris
  (McLaren) +0.041 4. George Russell (Mercedes) +0.053 5. Fernando Alonso (Aston
  Martin) +0.109 6. Lance Stroll (Aston Martin) +0.126 7. Gabriel Bortoleto
  (Sauber) +0.353 8. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) +0.356 9. Liam Lawson (Racing
  Bulls) +0.449 10. Isack Hadjar (Racing Bulls) +0.543 Both McLarens were under
  1min 15secs in Q2 but failed to better than time in Q3. That allowed Leclerc
  to take his first pole of the season. The McLarens are in and they can’t go
  faster than Leclerc, Piastri goes second and Norris third. What a stunner for
  Ferrari. Leclerc takes provisional pole with a 1min 15.372secs! The McLarens
  are on out laps. We’ll have their times, and likely the names on the front
  row, shortly. Alonso posts the second quckest time. He’s now ahead of Norris
  and just behind Piastri. Three minutes to go. Stroll goes third and Alonso is
  currently going quicker. Can he go top? Hadjar in the Racing Bull also failed
  to post a lap time. He is currently tenth, with Stroll ninth. The Aston
  Martins are out early again. Can Alonso improve on his initial time? Alonso
  and Verstappen make up the rest of the top five after those first laps. Great
  time for George Russell in the Mercedes. He is currently third on the
  provisional grid. Stroll has his lap time deleted for going over track limits.
  Norris goes top but it’s slower than his best in Q2. Piastri has a chance to
  post the fastest time, can he? He can. No times lower than 1min 15secs yet.
  Alonso goes top ahead of Lawson and Leclerc in the early stages here. Stroll
  and Alonso head out as the first cars on track for Q3. Here we go. Impressive
  stuff from the Racing Bulls, who are both in the top ten shootout, and the
  Aston Martins, especially third-placed Stroll. 11. Kimi Antonelli 12. Ollie
  Bearman 13. Lewis Hamilton 14. Carlos Sainz 15. Franco Colapinto Leclerc and
  Hamilton do not dramatically improve their times. Hamilton is heading out
  here. Leclerc and Hamilton are heading out in hope of an open road. They
  should have time to get two goes at this. Stroll is the only car on the track
  currently, it looks like the scare of rain has died down. No issues reported
  on the track. Seven minutes to go in Q2, the bottom five is currently
  Hamilton, Sainz, Bortoleto, Antonelli and Colapinto. The Ferraris are on the
  bubble. Leclerc is 10th and Hamilton 11th. Norris gets a “wow” from Martin
  Brundle on commentary, too right. The McLaren driver clocks a 1min 14.830secs.
  Piastri is close, but not quicker. They’re one and two on the leaderboard as
  it stands. Fernando Alonso posts a 1min 15.395secs lap time to go fastest. The
  Mercedes drivers post the opening times of Q2 but are slower than their best
  in Q1. Kimi Antonelli is out first, let’s see what he manages to post. Rain
  jackets are coming on in the stands, apparently it is raining at turn six.
  This could impact things, the drivers want to get out there. Q2 is underway
  and the cars are filtering out of the pitlane. Q2 slightly delayed due debris,
  we’ll be underway in around a minute. Zak Brown says that McLaren are
  preserving tyres for Q3, which explains why Norris didn’t improve on his first
  quick lap in Q1. 16. Yuki Tsunoda 17. Pierre Gasly 18. Esteban Ocon 19. Nico
  Hulkenberg 20. Alex Albon Liam Lawson clocks in a late tim that pushed Tsunoda
  down and out of Q1. The Red Bull driver has been struggling og late, he’s
  joined in the exit lane by Ocon, Gasly, Hulkenburg and Albon. With little over
  a minute of Q1 to go. Piastri back on top with a 1min 15.211secs. Fernando
  Alonso has just posted a new fastest time. He’s clocked a 1min 15.281 secs.
  Ocon, Gasly, Bearman, Tsunoda and Sainz are all in the danger zone ahead of
  the final hot laps of Q1. Five minutes to go. Eight cars are back in the pits
  setting up for their final run. Piastri is still top dog, but the Mercedes
  cars are now two and three. Troublingly for Red Bull both of their cars are
  both in the bottom ten. Verstappen is 13th and Yuki Tsunoda is 17th. Piastri
  goes top of the leaderboard with a 1min 15.554secs, he currently leads from
  Norris and Hamilton. We’ve just ticked under ten minutes to go in Q1. Albon
  posts the first time of qualifying, it’s in the 1min 17s and that won’t be
  troubling the top of the leaderboard. Here we go, Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon
  are now on track, 15 minutes to go until the end of Q1. We have a green light
  on Q1, no cars on track yet. There is some rain on the horizon, it’s not
  nearing the Hungaroring just yet. Worth tracking though. We’re about 15
  minutes from Q1. I’d go make your cups of tea now, if I were you. Fred
  Vasseur, who has just signed a new long-term deal to continue as Ferrari team
  principal, has been speaking with Sky ahead of qualifying. Below are few of
  his key quotes. On his new contract “If you want to win, you need stability in
  management.” On Ferrari’s progress: “Lots of teams would like to be P2 [in the
  constructors’ championship]. The target is P1 and we are trying to be closer
  to closer to McLaren.” On trying to get a race win this season: “It’s
  important to win, but that is dependent on circumstances and we need to be
  closer to Mclaren in the race. We are close in quali but need to be closer in
  the race. Step by step we’re getting closer.” Success breeds expectation as
  Lewis Hamilton, who has enjoyed both like few other drivers in Formula One,
  knows only too well. Having set himself the task of returning a title for
  Ferrari, anticipation for his first season with the team was off the scale but
  success has been far from forthcoming. As the Scuderia have struggled the
  seven-time champion has been drawing on every bit of experience in what may be
  the defining challenge of his storied career. At the Hungarian Grand Prix this
  weekend Ferrari announced they were extending their contract with team
  principal, Fred Vasseur, backing the Frenchman who was instrumental in
  bringing Hamilton on board to complete his mission of reforging Ferrari into a
  championship-winning outfit after underachieving for so long. However as the
  season approaches its summer break, with 10 races to come after Budapest and
  Ferrari winless, Vasseur still has much to achieve. Read Giles’ latest from
  the Hungarian Grand Prix in full: Lando Norris is a bit of a different
  character to those you usually see at the top of end elite sport. You only
  have to look at the Red Bull and Ferrari garages to see sportsmen cast in the
  traditional mould, but Norris does not seem to enjoy needle. It was suggested
  to the McLaren driver yesterday that he needed to try and get in the head
  teammate Oscar Piastri if the Briton is to ultimately win the drivers’
  championship this season. “I don’t enjoy that. In 200 years no one is going to
  care. We’ll all be dead,” replied Norris. “I am trying to have a good time. I
  still care about it, and that’s why I get upset sometimes and I get
  disappointed and I get angry at myself. And I think that shows just how much I
  care about winning and losing. “But that doesn’t mean I need to take it out on
  Oscar. I just don’t get into those kind of things.” 1. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)
  - 1min 14.916secs 2. Lando Norris (McLaren) +0.032secs 3. Charles Leclerc
  (Ferrari) +0.399secs 4. Lewis Hamilton (Ferrari) +0.768secs 5. Kimi Antonelli
  (Mercedes) +0.829secs 6. Fernando Alonso (Aston Martin) +0.878secs 7. Lance
  Stroll (Aston Martin) +0.912secs 8. George Russell (Mercedes) +0.924secs 10.
  Nico Hulkenberg (Sauber) +1.109secs In a rare twist, last week’s qualifying at
  Spa did not decide the race, but it did offer plenty of drama. Lewis Hamilton
  fell foul of track limits to go out in Q1 and Oscar Piastri was pipped to pole
  by McLaren teammate Lando Norris. More of the same today, please. Placing
  qualification at the Hungaroring in the 2025 season’s broader context, Norris
  said earlier this week that title will come down to “who qualifies first and
  second more often” while making the “least mistakes when they qualify first”.
  He noted that there have not been a lot of races where the lead has changed
  hands after turn one. This analysis is both correct and, therefore, a strong
  self-critique of his performance in the race at the Belgian Grand Prix, where
  he won the qualifying battle but lost the lead to Piastri on the first lap. As
  we prepare to enter the summer break, Piastri has won three times in races
  where he hasn’t qualified on pole, Norris has only managed this once, that
  coming at Silverstone. These are the fine margins that Norris will need to
  turn in his favour in Hungary and for the remainder of the season. It is
  foolish to read too much into practice but Norris was quicker than Piastri on
  Friday, albeit neither of those were under optimum conditions, but then the
  Australian clocked a 1min 14.916secs lap this morning to go 0.032secs quicker
  than his teammate. Elsewhere eyes in the Ferrari garage will be on Lewis
  Hamilton after he failed to get out of Q1 in both the sprint and main race
  last weekend. Late-stage Hamilton at Ferrari has become a curious entity, he
  is rarely troubling the podium places and also seems much more willing to
  admit mistakes. He described his qualifying performance as “unacceptable” and
  said he would be apologising to his team. Even though it is obvious that the
  Ferrari is not currenty fast enough to be winning races, Hamilton’s actions
  smack of a new hire who wants to ingratiate themselves with their colleagues.
  Undoubtedly the Briton is hopeful that it will payoff somewhere down the line
  when the team produce a competitve vehicle. It is now some time since the
  seven-time world champion had one of those. However, Fred Vasseur has signed a
  new deal with the Italian team, so the higher-ups clearly think the direction
  of travel is good. The Ferraris performed well this morning with Charles
  Leclerc notching the third quickest lap and Hamilton the fourth.
