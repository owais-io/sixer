  Cuddles, cuppas and chemistry: Albanese and Luxon downplay divisions in times
  of global turmoil

  The Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and his New Zealand
  counterpart, Christopher Luxon, made multiple references to the freezing
  Queenstown climate during their annual meet-up but the mood was far from
  frosty. As the evening light dipped behind the jagged peaks surrounding a
  billionaire’s bunker-like facility where the leaders held their bilateral
  talks at the weekend, Luxon quipped that the outdoor press conference was the
  coldest he had ever done and it was time for a cup of hot chocolate. Albanese,
  however, had other ideas. “We’re going in for a cuddle,” he said, giving Luxon
  a good pat on the back – a reference, perhaps, to their much-talked about
  embrace earlier in the day. It is the pair’s second annual meeting, following
  Luxon’s visit to Canberra last year but the leaders’ relationship precedes
  their time in office, having first met when Luxon was the chief executive of
  Air New Zealand, and Albanese was Australia’s transport minister. “We’ve been
  friends for a long time,” Albanese said. “We’re probably the two leaders of
  nations that can sit down and talk aviation like two nerds and bore everyone
  else around the international forums.” Australia is New Zealand’s only formal
  ally and the two countries have a long and close friendship, often walking in
  lock-step over global issues, defence and trade. ‘This bond has never been
  more important’ However, their meeting came as record numbers of New
  Zealanders are leaving for Australia in search of better opportunities, while
  Australia continues to deport people with criminal convictions back to New
  Zealand under its contentious 501 deportation policy. Those issues –
  particularly the latter – have been a long-running thorn in the side of the
  trans-Tasman relationship, but were downplayed by the leaders who chose to
  focus their attention on being trusted friends, amid major geopolitical
  upheaval. “At a time of global uncertainty this bond has never been more
  important,” Albanese said. Luxon, too, pointed to the certainty and
  predictability of the trans-Tasman alliance, and “the knowledge that we have
  one another’s backs”. Commitments to strengthen that bond included cooperating
  on growing each country’s economy, cutting regulatory tape to streamline
  trans-Tasman business and working closely on defence. The prime ministers also
  stood together on international issues, including on Israel’s latest plans for
  Gaza, China’s expansion in the Pacific and US tariffs. On Saturday, the
  foreign ministers of both countries – alongside Germany, Italy and the UK –
  released a joint statement condemning Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City.
  Last month, New Zealand and Australia cosigned the New York Call – a
  declaration indicating the possible recognition of Palestinian statehood.
  Neither Luxon nor Albanese would confirm when a declaration of statehood might
  happen but said Israel’s latest plans were “wrong” and urged the country to
  rethink its agenda. Both leaders also rejected the idea that possible trade
  retaliation from the US president, Donald Trump, over recognising Palestinian
  statehood would affect their positions. Australian goods imported into the US
  have attracted Trump’s baseline 10% tariff, while last week, New Zealand was
  hit with a surprise 15% tariff. “We make our own assessments in … our own
  economic and our security interests,” Luxon said, to which Albanese said:
  “Australia has exactly the same position.” Regarding China – the largest
  trading partner of both countries – the leaders said followed pretty much the
  same playbook: cooperate where they can and disagree where they must. On a icy
  Sunday morning in Arrowtown, the prime minsters laid a wreath in remembrance
  of fallen Anzac soldiers before embarking on a helicopter ride over the
  region’s mountains and glaciers. After another set of goodbye hugs at
  Queenstown airport, Albanese boarded his 737-8 Boeing business jet just after
  midday. Following his departure, Luxon told media the pair shared “good
  chemistry”, and that having a peer support group of other leaders was “really
  important”. Asked whether Albanese was “trolling” him by sporting the yellow
  scarf of the Wallabies – Australia’s national rugby team – Luxon said “he
  probably was a bit, yeah”. “He was probably trolling me a bit with that plane
  there too but I’ll just leave that for another day,” Luxon said, hinting at
  New Zealand’s beleaguered defence force fleet. Some trans-Tasman rivalries
  will never freeze over.
