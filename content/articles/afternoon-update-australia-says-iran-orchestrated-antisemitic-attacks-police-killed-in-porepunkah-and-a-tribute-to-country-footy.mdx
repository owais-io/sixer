  Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. Iran directed at least two attacks
  against Australia’s Jewish community, Australia’s domestic spy agency has
  determined, with Anthony Albanese describing the attacks as “extraordinary and
  dangerous acts by a foreign nation on Australian soil”. The prime minister
  announced on Tuesday afternoon that the Australian Security and Intelligence
  Organisation had “credible intelligence” to determine the Iranian government
  was behind the attacks against the Adass Israel Synagogue of Melbourne and
  Lewis’ Continental Kitchen, alleging “it is likely Iran directed further
  attacks as well”. In response to the investigation, the Iranian ambassador to
  Australia, Ahmad Sadeghi, will be expelled – the first removal of a foreign
  ambassador to Canberra since the postwar period – and Australia’s embassy in
  Tehran will suspend operation. Albanese also said the government will list
  Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, as a terrorist
  organisation. The Asio director general, Mike Burgess, said his agency did not
  believe Iran was involved in every act of antisemitism in Australia but was
  investigating other events for possible Iranian government involvement.
  Burgess said no Iranian diplomats here in Australia were involved. “This was
  directed by the IRGC through a series of overseas cut-outs, facilitators, to
  coordinators that found their way to tasking Australians,” he said. Top news
