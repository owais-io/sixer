  He’s spent years sitting on the bench, playing second fiddle to one of
  England’s best ever strikers. But now that Gary Lineker has hung up his boots
  and bid farewell to Match of the Day after 26 years, Mark Chapman can finally
  have his moment. While more casual fans won’t be aware of what the veteran
  broadcaster – affectionately known as “Chappers” – will bring as the new focal
  point, to the diehards he’s long been a known quantity. Widely respected for
  his relaxed manner and astute questioning, Chapman, 51, has hosted Match of
  the Day 2 on Sunday nights since 2013 (while occasionally covering for
  Lineker) and also presents a number of sports programmes across BBC Radio 5
  Live. But before establishing himself as one of the top broadcasters in the
  country, he began his career as a continuity announcer on BBC television in
  1996. He then became the cricket correspondent for BBC North East radio,
  before joining BBC Radio 1 as a Newsbeat sports reader on the Sara Cox and
  Scott Mills shows – where he developed the nickname “Chappers”. He later
  joined BBC Radio 5 Live to host 5 Live Sport on Mondays. Alongside his run on
  Match of the Day 2, he was also BBC Sport’s chief rugby league presenter,
  fronting its coverage of the Rugby League World Cup and RFL Challenge Cup
  matches. Chapman is one of Match of the Day’s three new hosts, alongside Kelly
  Cates and Gabby Logan. While Cates will present a UEFA Super Cup highlights
  show on Wednesday and Logan will present the newly rebranded Match of the Day
  on Sunday, the three will rotate across the shows throughout the season. He’s
  always been passionate about the game, declaring early in his career that he
  spent his time off “playing football and watching football”. When asked to
  describe himself in three words, he opted for “stroppy, moody and
  temperamental”. Appearing on the Scott Mills Breakfast show on Friday
  alongside the other two hosts, Chapman joked with Mills about their time
  working together. “He never took off his coat,” Mills reminisced, “he was
  there for a good time, not a long time.” Mills also highlighted one of his BBC
  diary entries from the early noughties, when the pair went to Magaluf with Jo
  Whiley. “We went to dinner with DJ Sammy in Palma except for Chappers, who
  decided to shun a swanky celebrity dinner in order to do research on the
  Magaluf bar scene. Apparently, when you walk down the street, there are people
  who physically drag you into bars and force you to drink two pints for two
  euros with a free shot. Poor Chappers never stood a chance,” the entry read.
  Others have also said it is Chapman’s warmth, humour and experience that make
  him a joy to work with. “He’s somebody that knows the game very well, is
  deeply passionate about it and is very good at providing a space where all the
  different pundits and people involved feel comfortable,” said Nedum Onuoha,
  who worked with Chapman on Planet Premier League. “He tries to get the best
  out of you. He is very good at being able to create a show that’s enjoyable,
  and I think that goes a long way in punditry.” Onuoha said Chapman was “really
  funny and dry with certain things”. He said the presenter always remembered
  “that it is a game” and wanted people to have fun. “He knows that laughing
  brings people together, as opposed to arguing about things that honestly don’t
  really matter. His personality is a great one, he’s fun to be around and that
  can really make a difference, especially for new people entering the
  industry.” Chapman lived with his wife, Sara, in Hale, Greater Manchester
  until her death from cancer in 2020. The couple had three children together.
  One of the things that will undoubtedly be welcomed by BBC bosses is Chapman’s
  approach to social media. He hasn’t posted on X since January 2021, which sets
  him apart from his predecessor, who quit the BBC after an antisemitism row and
  never shied away from expressing his views on topics from the war in the
  Middle East to the UK government’s immigration policy. Asked about the
  principal duties of a pundit in an interview with the Guardian in 2018,
  Chapman said: “To inform, entertain and give an opinion. They don’t always
  have to do highbrow analysis or be controversial – there’s a balance to be
  found.” Match of the Day’s new rotating line up, featuring two women, is a far
  cry from the days of Jimmy Hill and Des Lynam at the helm. But while leaning
  in to the change, Chapman and his co-hosts have worked to avoid comparisons to
  their predecessors. “It helps that we’re all really different from Gary
  [Lineker], in that he does it with a profile of his own as an England legend,”
  Cates has said. “It’s a very different career path. An ex-player taking over
  would be more of a direct comparison.”
