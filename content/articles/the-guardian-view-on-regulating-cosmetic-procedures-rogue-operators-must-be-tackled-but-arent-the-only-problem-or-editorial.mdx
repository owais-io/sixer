  The enormous popularity of beauty treatments, including dermatological fillers
  and Botox injections, is not solely an issue for health regulators. Changing
  norms and aspirations about appearances, and the way that these are marketed
  mainly to women and girls, are a cultural and economic phenomenon that
  requires wider consideration. While attitudes to these procedures and
  aesthetics vary, many people – including some cosmetic surgeons – are
  concerned that younger women account for a growing share of a highly lucrative
  and growing market. The death last year of 33-year-old Alice Webb in
  Gloucestershire, after a non-surgical Brazilian butt lift, as well as multiple
  reports of injuries, and the deaths of at least 28 women who have travelled to
  Turkey for cosmetic treatments, have increased the pressure on ministers to
  tighten the law. Wes Streeting’s announcement of new licence requirements for
  UK businesses, and tighter regulation of higher-risk treatments, is probably
  overdue. The Chartered Trading Standards Institute recently warned that
  untrained people have given cosmetic injections in public toilets and hotels.
  Altering the law in order to exclude such “rogue operators” ought to make high
  streets and the internet – where many clinics advertise – safer. Talking about
  the risks, as the health secretary has been doing, and holding a consultation
  on proposed changes, may have the beneficial effect of raising awareness even
  before changes are introduced. But councils will need resources if they are to
  be expected to enforce new rules by issuing licences, checking premises and so
  on. As in many other areas of economic activity, the law on its own is
  unlikely to be enough. Mechanisms are needed to ensure that businesses comply.
  It is already illegal to administer Botox or dermal fillers to children in
  England – although, worryingly, it is still allowed in Wales and Scotland. Mr
  Streeting’s announcement that rules regarding children will be tightened
  further is particularly welcome. Strenuous efforts should be made to place
  them off limits for the industry as a whole. The reported preoccupation of
  some children with anti-ageing products is not healthy and should be
  discouraged. Mr Streeting did not refer to the cost to the NHS if cosmetic
  procedures go wrong, when announcing plans to tighten the law. But Karin
  Smyth, one of his ministers, has raised this. And Prof Sir Stephen Powis, who
  was NHS England’s national medical director until last month, made the same
  point specifically in relation to butt lifts – the cosmetic procedure with the
  highest death rate of all. Ministers should expect pushback even though many
  experts, including plastic surgeons, favour tighter rules. The pro-growth mood
  of the Treasury means proposals for new regulations are unlikely to be smiled
  upon there. The more restrictive approach being proposed for England will also
  do nothing to prevent surgical tourism and could even increase it, if tighter
  regulation of the domestic industry results in higher prices. The gap in
  safeguards that allows foreign cosmetic surgery providers to market directly
  to the public needs to be addressed separately, which the government has begun
  to recognise. There is no single or instant fix. But by cracking down on
  cowboy operators, ministers will send a message that appearance-altering
  injections and other invasive treatments must be treated seriously. They are a
  different order of activity from applying makeup or painting nails. Do you
