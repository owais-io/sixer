  Archaeologists in Peru have discovered a multicoloured three-dimensional wall
  that could date back 4,000 years, in an unprecedented find that has shifted
  archaeological understanding about the first civilisations in the Americas.
  The centrepiece of the three-by-six metre wall carving is a stylistic
  depiction of a large bird of prey with outstretched wings, its head adorned
  with three-dimensional diamond motifs that visually align the south and north
  faces of the mural. It is covered with high-relief friezes and features
  designs painted in blue, yellow, red and black. The sophisticated and
  stylistic imagery sheds new light on the beliefs and social structures of
  early civilisations in the formative period (2000-1000BC) in Peru.
  Archaeologists consider pre-Hispanic Peru to be one of the birthplaces of
  civilisation in the Americas, with an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites,
  including famous tourist attractions such as Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines.
  Ana Cecilia Mauricio, the lead archaeologist at the Huaca Yolanda excavation
  site in the Tanguche valley, in Peru’s La Libertad region, said the discovery
  spoke of “the emergence of social hierarchy in Peru as societies get more
  complex and become civilisations”. The double-sided mural is part of the
  interior decoration of a courtyard within a temple. The 3D designs – which
  also include stylised fish, fishing nets, mythological beings and stars – give
  a fascinating insight into the cosmovision of these formative coastal
  civilisations. “These were people who lived from agriculture and from the sea
  but they already show the first signs of social hierarchy,” said Mauricio, an
  associate professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, speaking by
  phone from the dig where the discovery was made. The most influential and
  powerful people would have been shamans, male and female, or priests or
  priestesses, Mauricio explained. “They possessed important knowledge about
  medicinal plants and also about astronomy; they could predict the weather
  conditions through observation of the stars and the sun,” she said. “They
  acquired knowledge and began to perfect it. They were, in a sense, scientists
  as well as spiritual and religious leaders,” she added. One of the carvings
  depicts three humanoid figures which appear to show a transformation from a
  human into a bird, Mauricio explained. She said it could represent the
  figurative transformation of a shaman into a psychoactive state, known as a
  “rite of passage”, after consuming a substance like San Pedro cactus, a
  traditional South American hallucinogen. Mauricio said the Huaca Yolanda site
  probably predated Chavín de Huántar, one of the most studied pre-Hispanic
  ceremonial sites in the Andes. Both belong to the formative period timeframe
  which marks the beginning of early civilisations. John Rick, the US
  archaeologist leading investigations at Chavín de Huántar has documented the
  ceremonial use of hallucinogens inside tunnels in the 2,500-year-old temple
  complex. The Huaca Yolanda site faces more prosaic threats from advancing
  agriculture, urban development and looting, which has already destroyed
  surrounding ruins, says Mauricio. She said the site – which she has been
  exploring since 2012 as part of research into early ecodynamics in the Chao
  and Santa Valleys – did not yet have full protection from Peru’s culture
  ministry and regional authorities. “People in the past had a relationship with
  their environmental and climatic surroundings that can be valuable to us in
  the present,” said Mauricio of the early civilisation which managed to live
  alongside the El Niño weather phenomenon that regularly causes devastation
  through flooding and landslides in modern Peru. “Can this knowledge help us
  understand how to deal with climatic phenomena now?”
