  Minimum salaries are being introduced in the Women’s Super League and WSL2
  this season and will stop second-tier players needing part-time jobs on the
  side, Holly Murdoch, the chief operating officer of WSL Football, has told the
  Guardian. WSL2 has moved to fully professional criteria and its minimum
  “salary floor” has been agreed in collaboration with the Professional
  Footballers’ Association, Murdoch said. Previously, average salaries were
  understood to be so low at some clubs that many second-tier players needed
  additional income from jobs such as teaching or physiotherapy “I think we’ve
  come up with a floor that will have a meaningful impact for our players,”
  Murdoch said. “We consulted with the PFA, they were a really important
  stakeholder on this, and this is something that has to remain under review
  constantly because the game is changing so quickly. We’ll analyse all the data
  off the back of this transfer window and updated salaries, and then we’ll
  review all of the policy around it again as the game grows.” The NWSL in the
  United States has a minimum salary of €48,500 (£36,170) this year. The WSL has
  not revealed the minimum salaries for the WSL and WSL 2 but Murdoch says the
  figure will be different for specific age groups, and different in each
  division. We wanted to make sure that they could focus on being a footballer,
  not focus on a part-time job over here and the pressures that come with that,
  [helping] players focus all their energies on being the very best footballer
  on the pitch that they can be. We did a huge, 18-month project; this wasn’t
  something that we just thought up two months ago and rolled it out. It took
  extensive consultation. “It’s not as easy as just saying: ‘Oh, it’s this
  amount of money a year,’ because there are different thresholds depending on
  your age group. It [was also about] making it a jump that was affordable. I
  think we’re all aware, women’s football is still financially fragile. We’re
  seeing wonderful growth and it’s such an exciting period, but we know that
  costs outweigh revenue short-term. We know the revenue opportunity in the
  women’s game is phenomenal, but we do need to be really thoughtful about not
  just loading costs into any business. We have to be adding value. “We’re also
  putting more support around those players, so there will be a number of
  additional mandatory roles that will be rolled out – we’re introducing a
  [mandatory] performance wellbeing role within all of our clubs. Football
  traditionally hasn’t moved in that space, but we see the importance of
  supporting athletes.” The Guardian revealed in May that WSL Football and the
  PFA were in talks over a historic deal for second-tier players to be
  represented by the union. Murdoch said such a deal was close: “We’ve had a
  really good kind of collaborative relationship with the PFA since the new
  company was established a year ago. We established the first ever women’s
  professional footballer negotiating committee which means that we have a
  structured place to talk about player contracts.” Unlike in the NWSL, there is
  no salary cap on higher earners in England, but Murdoch revealed a new
  financial framework was being introduced this season, which will be under
  review before potentially a more formal rollout of rules from next season,
  altering how much clubs are allowed to spend on players’ wages. “We have no
  intent to kind of ‘cap’ any players’ earnings,” she said. “We’re at the
  investment stage of women’s football, so we don’t want to deter investment. We
  don’t want to put in rules that don’t make us an attractive investment. But
  we’re also really mindful that we have to have frameworks in place that
  protect our long-term future.” WSL Football has not yet disclosed the spending
  cap but it is understood the framework will allow clubs to spend up to 80% of
  their revenue, plus a capped contribution from owners, on wages. Previously
  wage bills were capped at 40% of a club’s revenue but allowances were made for
  owner contributions without an apparent maximum amount. The season gets under
  way on Friday, with Chelsea hosting Manchester City at Stamford Bridge and
  Sheffield United playing Sunderland at Bramall Lane in WSL 2. There are new
  promotion and relegation structures because the top tier is being increased
  from 12 to 14 clubs next summer. There will be two automatic promotion spots
  from WSL 2 and a promotion/relegation playoff between the WSL’s bottom side
  and the third-placed WSL 2 team. In future seasons there will be one automatic
  promotion and relegation slot and a promotion/relegation playoff. Murdoch
  said: “We wanted to increase movement within the pyramid because there has
  been a lack of movement in the pyramid over the last 10 years [and] a
  potential risk of stagnation, particularly in WSL 2, that there were some
  clubs that had been sat kind of mid-table, never in the relegation zone, never
  going to be promoted, [and] that’s not good. We heard loud and clear what was
  really important to fans.”
