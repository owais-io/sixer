  Essentially a fancy name for “things on toast”, a tartine is a topless
  sandwich that can be piled high with delicious things with no threat of being
  squished together. I love the simplicity and elegance of this recipe: it is
  the perfect balance of sweet and sour, spicy and salty, and it feels special
  at the same time. Griddle and marinate the peaches ahead of time, if you like,
  and feel free to switch them for nectarines, apricots or whatever you have to
  hand that looks good for griddling. Grilled peach, gorgonzola and thyme
  tartines Prep 5 min Cook 20 min Serves 2 2 peaches (about 200g) Olive oil Sea
  salt and black pepper A few sprigs fresh thyme 1 tbsp honey 1 pinch red chilli
  flakes 1 small ciabatta, or half a large one 1 garlic clove, peeled and cut in
  half 150g gorgonzola A handful of rocket leaves Put a griddle pan on a high
  heat. Halve the peaches, remove the stones and cut the fruit into wedges. Put
  the wedges in a small bowl, drizzle with a tablespoon of olive oil and season
  generously. Add the leaves from the thyme sprigs, toss to coat, then griddle
  the peach slices for a minute or two on each side, until they take on dark
  char lines and soften slightly. Return them to the bowl, add the honey and
  chilli flakes, toss again and set aside. Heat the grill to high. Cut the
  ciabatta in half horizontally and toast under the hot grill for a couple of
  minutes, until golden and very lightly toasted. Drizzle each slice with olive
  oil and rub with the cut side of the halved garlic clove. Cut the gorgonzola
  into ½cm-thick slices and lay these over one side of the ciabatta halves.
  Return to the grill for just a minute, until oozy, then top with the dressed
  peaches. Toss the rocket with any remaining dressing in the peach bowl,
  arrange on top of the tartines and tuck in.
