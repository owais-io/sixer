  The New Orleans mayor, LaToya Cantrell, was indicted by a federal grand jury
  Friday on corruption charges involving a purported romance with her former
  bodyguard. Cantrell, 53, thus became the first New Orleans mayor in the city’s
  307-year history to be charged by the US government with crimes while still in
  office. The indictment against Cantrell came after she drew scrutiny for an
  alleged affair with a now retired New Orleans police officer who had served as
  her bodyguard. Cantrell and the bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, allegedly plotted
  to foster their personal and romantic relationship while he was clocked in at
  work and being paid to provide her with protection. As Guardian reporting
  partner WWL Louisiana reported, Cantrell also allegedly arranged for Vappie to
  accompany her on at least 14 out-of-state trips, including to Scotland and the
  United Arab Emirates, claiming concerns about her safety that required
  protection. The trips cost the New Orleans’ city government more than $70,000,
  not counting Cantrell’s travel expenses, the charging documents filed on
  Friday said. The pair were also accused of using a city-owned apartment on the
  edge of New Orleans’s Jackson Square, in its historic French Quarter
  neighborhood, to spend time together while Vappie was supposed to be on duty.
  Cantrell and Vappie, 52, are accused of then seeking to cover up the
  relationship by using an encrypted messaging program and deleting at least
  some of the 15,000 messages they exchanged, as well as lying to federal
  agents, grand jurors, colleagues and the public. When a New Orleans resident
  took photos of the Cantrell and Vappie dining together and drinking wine, the
  mayor filed a police report and temporarily obtained a restraining order, he
  said. Friday’s charges also allege that Vappie “attempted to persuade” New
  Orleans’s interim police superintendent from December 2022 to October 2023,
  Michelle Woodfork, to “make it right” and exonerate him as investigators
  circled. Cantrell then met with Woodfork – in front of Vappie – and told her
  she would not be offered the long-term superintendent’s post, the indictment
  contended. Cantrell and Vappie are facing charges of wire fraud, obstruction
  of justice, conspiracy to commit both of those crimes, false statements and
  untrue declarations to a grand jury. The most serious charges are the wire
  fraud- and obstruction of justice related ones, which can carry up to 20 years
  in prison. Vappie had already been charged in July 2024 – shortly after he
  retired from the New Orleans police – with wire fraud and lying to FBI agents.
  The allegations against him and Cantrell called to mind the 2018 scandal that
  cost the Nashville mayor, Megan Barry, her job and centered on an affair with
  her bodyguard, Robert Forrest. Prosecutors who obtained the 2024 charges
  against Vappie alleged he researched that case online two years beforehand.
  Friday’s charges against Cantrell also come after the September 2024
  indictment of New Orleans businessman Randy Farrell. Farrell was charged with
  exchanging gifts with the mayor so she would allegedly fire a municipal
  employee who was investigating Farrell’s building inspection company. Among
  the alleged gifts were tickets to a January 2019 New Orleans Saints football
  game, which was being played with a Super Bowl appearance on the line, a
  cellphone and lunch at an upscale Ruth’s Chris Steak House in the city. Vappie
  and Farrell had pleaded not guilty to the charges previously filed against
  them. While the Donald Trump-led US justice department obtained the indictment
  against Cantrell about seven months into the Republican’s second presidency,
  the federal investigation into the mayor began while Joe Biden – her fellow
  Democrat – was in his second full year in the Oval Office. The timing of
  Friday’s indictment coincided with the grand jurors being scheduled to wind
  down their work. Such panels are typically in place for six months, but this
  one had been extended twice since first convening in February 2024. Cantrell’s
  office issued a statement saying it would not comment on Friday’s indictment
  until it had been reviewed by her defense attorney, Eddie Castaing. At a press
  briefing, the acting US attorney in New Orleans, Michael Simpson, accused
  Cantrell and Vappie of “an incredible betrayal” of the public’s trust in its
  own government. Cantrell, a native of Compton, California, had been a New
  Orleans city council member before winning election as its first-ever female
  mayor in November 2017. She succeeded Mitch Landrieu, who was later the Biden
  administration’s infrastructure czar. Cantrell’s first four-year term was
  partly marked by her guiding the city through the Covid-19 pandemic. And, in
  2019, New Orleans registered a 47-year low of homicides. Cantrell was
  re-elected in November 2021, and her second term has been considerably
  turbulent. The federal investigation began with 2022 subpoenas issued
  regarding an image consultant she employed. Her husband – Jason, with whom she
  had a daughter – unexpectedly died in August 2023. And, as the AP noted, her
  civic profile receded as she locked herself into feuds with a hostile city
  council while alienating former confidantes as well as supporters. The city
  council responded by weakening the mayor’s power through voter-approved
  changes to the municipal governing charter. Cantrell and her remaining allies
  maintain that, as a Black woman, she has been treated differently from her
  male predecessors. Simpson on Friday denied that race or gender factored into
  the investigation against Cantrell. Cantrell was term-limited from seeking
  another stint as mayor and is due to leave office in January. Several
  candidates have signed up to run to replace her in a primary election set for
  October. Only one other person who has served as New Orleans mayor has been
  charged with federal crimes: Ray Nagin. Nagin was the New Orleans mayor when
  the failure of federal levees there during Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005
  destroyed the city and caused about 1,400 deaths. He was charged after leaving
  office and convicted in 2014 on charges of bribery, honest services wire
  fraud, money laundering, filing false tax returns and conspiracy. He then
  received a 10-year prison sentence. The Associated Press and WWL Louisiana
