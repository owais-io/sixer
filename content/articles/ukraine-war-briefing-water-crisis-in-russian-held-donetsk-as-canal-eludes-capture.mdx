  The illegally appointed head of the partly Russian-held Donetsk region in
  eastern Ukraine has said a water crisis that is forcing people to queue at
  tanker trucks can only be fixed if Russia takes full control of the region and
  a vital canal. Built in the 1950s, the 83-mile (135km) canal, which connects
  two rivers, starts about 12 miles north-east of Sloviansk, which is held by
  Ukrainian forces, and finishes near Donetsk city in an area controlled by
  Russian forces. Denis Pushilin, the Russian official imposed by Vladimir Putin
  as head of the region, accused Ukraine of “a water blockade” but Ukrainian
  officials say parts of the canal have been damaged in the war and other parts
  are located in frontline areas. Residents have embarrassed Pushilin and put
  pressure on the Donetsk occupation regime by sending an open letter to Putin
  asking him to intervene in what they called “a humanitarian and ecological
  catastrophe”. Ukrainian commentators have pointed to the problem to criticise
  Russian governance. In Donetsk, Reuters reported that people queued at a water
  truck to fill up five-litre plastic bottles and petrol canisters with water
  before carting them away on trolleys or in their car boots. “I am 78,” said
  one pensioner who gave her name as Lyubov and was visibly upset. “How am I
  supposed to come here, collect water, and bring it back home? I need to go to
  the toilet and wash.” Speaking to Reuters in the city of Donetsk, Pushilin –
  who has been grilled by Putin on TV about the shortages – said tap water was
  only available for several hours every three days and described the situation
  as “sensitive”. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he and US envoy Keith Kellogg had
  held a good meeting and discussed exerting pressure on Russia to hold “real
  talks” on ending more than three years of war. “We are ready to talk in a
  format with leaders. This is needed to resolve key issues,” Zelenskyy said.
  Marco Rubio spoke with his European counterparts on Monday and discussed
  diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, the US state
  department said. Zelenskyy said there would be a further meeting between
  Ukrainian and US teams at the end of the week. Germany is ready to help
  Ukraine obtain reliable security guarantees to ensure “lasting peace” once the
  conflict with Russia ends, Germany’s vice-chancellor said on Monday during a
  visit to Kyiv. Germany, Ukraine’s biggest military backer after the US,
  planned to spend €9bn supporting Kyiv this year and in 2026. While France and
  Britain have floated the idea of sending forces to uphold any peace agreement,
  Germany has sounded cool about the prospect. Zelenskyy said on Monday that
  Kyiv aims to secure at least $1bn on a monthly basis from allies to buy US
  weapons. He made the remark during a joint briefing in Kyiv with the Norwegian
  prime minister, Jonas Gahr Store. The Norwegian government aims to maintain
  its aid to Ukraine at 85bn kroner ($8.4bn) in 2026, the same level as this
  year, said the Norwegian PM’s office. Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, has
  vetoed legislation to prolong benefits received by Ukrainian refugees in
  Poland, writes Shaun Walker. Only Ukrainians in work should receive child
  benefit payments, he said. The prime minister, Donald Tusk, criticised the
  veto, and the labour minister, Agnieszka Dziemianowicz-Bąk, said: “We cannot
  punish people for losing their job – particularly not innocent children. This
  is the ABC of human decency.” Since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, around
  a million refugees, mostly women and children, have settled in Poland.
  Poland’s digital affairs minister, Krzysztof Gawkowski, said that by vetoing
  legislation Nawrocki also put at risk Poland’s continued funding of Starlink
  satellite internet for Ukraine. “This is the end of Starlink internet, which
  Poland provides to Ukraine as it wages war.” A spokesperson for Nawrocki told
  Reuters that Starlink payments could continue if parliament adopted a proposed
  presidential bill by the end of September.
