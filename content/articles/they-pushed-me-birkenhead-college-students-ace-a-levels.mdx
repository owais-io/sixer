  Eva Baker, 18, was racked with nerves in the days running up to Thursday –
  when sixth-form students throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland
  received their A-level results. “The sleepless nights were worth it though,”
  said Baker. “I just got off the phone with my first choice and I’ve got in, I
  can’t believe it honestly. I’m just made up.” In the past two years, Baker
  said she went from not knowing if she even wanted to finish school to being
  appointed head student and achieving grades she did not think were possible –
  including an A in law, which she is going to study in September. “Before I
  came here, I don’t know, I was on the wrong track I think. I just didn’t think
  I could do it. But my teacher saw something in me that I didn’t see in myself.
  They made me head student and they pushed me, helped me study and I’m so
  grateful.” Eva was one of the hundreds of delighted faces opening their
  results outside Birkenhead sixth-form college, a state institute that says it
  prioritises social mobility and opportunity in an area with some of the
  highest levels of deprivation in the country. Of the more than 600 students
  who attend the school, 92% will go to their first-choice university this year,
  10% more than the national average and significantly more than the 60%
  achieved by other schools in the area. “We’ve had so many parents say this is
  the best choice they’ve ever made,” said its principal, Mike Kilbride,
  watching students and parents line up in the car park to enjoy a free
  celebratory breakfast provided by the college. “What we do is we say, we’re
  going to take people from our community – in all these shapes and sizes that
  they come in – and we’re going to help them become outstanding young people,
  academically and behaviourally and culturally. “So we are about moulding young
  people, whether they go to university or not, to be the best people they can
  be.” Kaitlin Archer received three As and is due to start studying to be a
  doctor in Edinburgh. Having travelled in from Cheshire every day and often
  staying after school to study, she said the school had helped her grow as a
  person as well as a student, giving her the confidence to move away to a new
  city for the next phase of her life. “I think to be honest, the biggest change
  has just been me as a person. I’ve always been, you know, someone who just
  stays at home, but I’ve come here and met the people and I feel like I’ve just
  changed a lot. I’m happy academically but personally as well, I’m happy with
  where I’ve ended up.” One of the school’s greatest success stories this year
  is 18-year-old Scott Rawling, who has been admitted to the University of
  Oxford to study english literature. Rawling, state educated and from nearby
  Pensby, said he was proud to have achieved something that he thought was
  impossible when he started his A-levels two years ago. “It’s something that’s
  in the back of your mind, that a lot of people who go to those types of places
  are richer,” said Rawling, who was encouraged to apply to Oxbridge by his
  teachers. “It’s not something I expected, but I’m so happy I got in, and I
  feel pride in the fact that I went to a state school.” Among the sea of smiles
  in the school’s car park, possibly the biggest was worn by Jane Rawling,
  Scott’s mother. Speaking about her son’s achievements while apologising for
  him disappearing to go to the pub with his friends, she said she could not be
  prouder of her son. “He’s worked so hard and the school’s helped him so much,
  it’s amazing. He really has put a lot of effort in and I’m really pleased that
  it’s paid off.” Jane Rawling said she would pack her son a Tranmere Rovers top
  when he leaves to begin his studies in October, but that she was not worried
  about his future prospects. “I’m so glad as well that he stayed true to
  himself,” she said. “You know, he’s not changed in any particular way other
  than he’s just developed and he’s grown and he’s just a really nice person and
  I think, actually, Oxford will be really lucky to have him.”
