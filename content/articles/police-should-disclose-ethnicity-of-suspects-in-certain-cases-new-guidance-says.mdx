  says

  Police forces should consider disclosing the nationality and/or ethnicity of
  suspects when they are charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations,
  according to new official guidance. After a row over claims that police
  “covered up” the backgrounds of two men charged in connection with the alleged
  rape of a child, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) and the College of
  Policing have backed plans to release details of nationality when there is a
  “policing purpose” for doing so. This could be to reduce the risk to public
  safety, “where there are high levels of mis- or disinformation about a
  particular incident”, or in cases of significant public interest, senior
  police said. The decision to release new guidance has been praised by a former
  senior prosecutor, who said it could help counter rumours and disinformation
  that spread on social media. But it will also anger some anti-racist
  campaigners, who have expressed concern that such proposals could risk framing
  violence against women and girls as an issue of ethnicity instead of misogyny.
  The decision comes after Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, urged police to
  release the details of ethnicity last week. Forces are already encouraged to
  publicise charging decisions in serious cases, the NPCC said. Decisions on
  whether to release this information will remain with forces, an NPCC statement
  said, with wider legal and ethical considerations. The Home Office will decide
  if it is “appropriate in all the circumstances” to confirm the immigration
  status of a suspect, the guidance said. Failure to share basic facts about the
  Southport killer last summer led to “dangerous fictions” which helped spark
  rioting, an independent watchdog found. Jonathan Hall KC, the UK’s independent
  reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it would have been “far better” for
  the authorities to share more accurate detail about the arrest of Axel
  Rudakubana on 29 July last year. Far-right agitators wrongly claimed that the
  killer was a Muslim asylum seeker. Deputy chief constable Sam de Reya, the
  NPCC lead for communications and media, said: “We saw during last summer’s
  disorder, as well as in several recent high-profile cases, what the major,
  real-world consequences can be from what information police release into the
  public domain. “We have to make sure our processes are fit for purpose in an
  age of social media speculation and where information can travel incredibly
  quickly across a wide range of channels. “Disinformation and incorrect
  narratives can take hold in a vacuum. It is good police work for us to fill
  this vacuum with the facts about issues of wider public interest.” Nazir
  Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor for North West England, cautiously
  welcomed the decision. “Trust is so low that more transparency is a good
  thing, as recent experience has shown. It has to be on a case by case basis
  though,” he said. The Warwickshire police and crime commissioner, Philip
  Seccombe, called for fresh national guidance after police were accused by
  Reform UK of failing to confirm that two Afghan men being prosecuted for an
  alleged attack on a 12-year-old girl were asylum seekers. The alleged rape,
  said to have happened on 22 July, was at the centre of a political storm after
  the Reform leader, Nigel Farage, amplified claims of a police cover-up. Ahmad
  Mulakhil has been charged with rape and Mohammad Kabir has been charged with
  kidnap and strangulation. • This article and its headline were amended on 15
  August 2025. An earlier version said that, under the new guidance, a suspect’s
  immigration status should be considered for disclosure by police in certain
  cases. In fact, the guidance reaffirms that it is not the role or
  responsibility of the police to verify a suspect’s immigration status; local
  forces should pass such decisions on to the Home Office.
