  fighters

  Only one in four detainees from Gaza are identified as fighters by Israel’s
  military intelligence, classified data indicates, with civilians making up the
  vast majority of Palestinians held without charge or trial in abusive prisons.
  Those jailed for long periods without charge or trial include medical workers,
  teachers, civil servants, media workers, writers, sick and disabled people and
  children. Among the most egregious cases are those of an 82-year-old woman
  with Alzheimer’s jailed for six weeks and of a single mother separated from
  her young children. When the mother was released after 53 days she found the
  children begging on the streets. The Sde Teiman military base at one point
  held so many sick, disabled and elderly Palestinians that they had their own
  hangar, dubbed “the geriatric pen”, a soldier serving there said. The scale of
  civilian detention indicated by Israel’s own data has been revealed in an
  investigation by the Guardian, the Israeli-Palestinian publication +972
  Magazine and the Hebrew-language outlet Local Call. Israeli military
  intelligence keeps a database of more than 47,000 named individuals whom it
  classifies as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters. Commanders
  consider it the most accurate information Israel has on enemy forces,
  according to multiple intelligence sources. It is based on information
  including files captured from Hamas, updated regularly and includes names of
  new recruits. In May this year the database listed 1,450 individuals in
  detention, whose files were marked “arrested”. That is equivalent to just one
  in four of all Palestinians from Gaza held in Israeli jails on suspicion of
  militant links since 7 October 2023. At that point in May Israel had detained
  6,000 people under its “unlawful combatants” legislation, which allows
  indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial, official data released after
  legal appeals showed. Israel is also holding up to 300 Palestinians from Gaza
  suspected of taking part in the 7 October attacks. They are in criminal
  detention because Israel says it has sufficient evidence to prosecute them,
  although no trials have been held. Both rights groups and Israeli soldiers
  have described an even smaller ratio of fighters to civilians. When photos of
  Palestinians stripped and shackled caused international outrage in late 2023,
  senior officers told Haaretz newspaper that “85 to 90 per cent” were not Hamas
  members. The Gaza-based Al Mezan Center for Human Rights has represented
  hundreds of civilians held in Israeli jails. “We believe the proportion of
  civilians among those detained is even higher than Israel’s own figures
  suggest,” said Samir Zaqout, Mezan’s deputy director. “At most, perhaps one in
  six or seven might have any link to Hamas or other militant factions, and even
  then, not necessarily through their military wings.” Israel’s military said it
  had returned more than 2,000 civilian detainees to Gaza after finding no
  connection to militant activity. Israel was fighting enemies who “disguise
  themselves as civilians”, but those releases demonstrated “a thorough review
  process” for detentions, the military said in a statement. It did not dispute
  the existence of the database or the figures for May, but claimed that “most”
  detainees were “involved in terrorist activities”. In May 2,750 Palestinians
  were permanently interned as unlawful combatants, and another 1,050 had been
  released under ceasefire deals, the military said. Israeli politicians, the
  military and the media often refer to all detainees as “terrorists”. That
  includes Fahamiya al-Khalidi, an 82-year-old with Alzheimer’s who was abducted
  with her female carer in Gaza City in December 2023, and held in Israel for
  six weeks under the unlawful combatant law, prison documentation shows. She
  was disoriented, could not remember her age and thought she was still in Gaza,
  according to a military medic who treated her in Anatot detention centre after
  she injured herself on a fence. “I remember her limping badly toward the
  clinic. And she’s classified as an unlawful combatant. The way that label is
  used is insane,” the medic said. Photographs confirm his presence at Anatot at
  the time. The Israeli military said Khalidi was targeted “based on specific
  intelligence concerning her personally”, but the arrest should not have gone
  ahead. “The detention was not appropriate and was the result of a local,
  isolated error in judgment,” the military said, adding that “individuals with
  medical conditions or even disabilities can still be involved in terrorism”,
  citing Hamas’s former military chief Mohammed Deif. Israel’s unlawful
  combatants legislation allows indefinite detention without producing evidence
  in open court. The state can hold someone for 75 days before allowing access
  to a lawyer and 45 days before bringing them in front of a judge to authorise
  the detention. At the start of the war, those periods were extended to 180 and
  75 days respectively. There have been no known trials of anyone captured in
  Gaza since 7 October 2023. Tal Steiner, the director of the Public Committee
  Against Torture, said: “As soon as the wave of mass arrests began in Gaza in
  October 2023, there was serious concern that many uninvolved people were being
  detained without cause. “This concern was confirmed when we learned that half
  of those arrested at the beginning of the war were eventually released,
  demonstrating that there had been no basis for their detention in the first
  place.” State figures on the number of unlawful combatants were given to the
  group after it launched a lawsuit. One soldier who served at Sde Teiman
  military prison, which became notorious for abuse, described mass detentions
  of elderly and severely ill people. “They brought men in wheelchairs, people
  without legs,” he said, adding these detainees were sent to a “geriatric pen”.
  “I always assumed the supposed excuse for arresting patients was that maybe
  they had seen the hostages or something.” Hassan Jabareen, the director of the
  Palestinian legal rights group Adalah said Israel’s unlawful combatants
  legislation was “designed to facilitate the mass detention of civilians and
  enforced disappearances”. “It strips detainees of protections guaranteed under
  international law, including safeguards specifically intended for civilians,
  using the ‘unlawful combatant’ label to justify the systematic denial of their
  rights.” The military medic who treated Khalidi said he also treated a woman
  bleeding heavily after a miscarriage and a breastfeeding mother who had been
  separated from her baby and asked him for a pump to stop her breast milk from
  drying up. Abeer Ghaban, 40, who was held with Khalidi inside Israel, was
  separated from her daughter aged 10, and two boys aged nine and seven, when
  she was detained at an Israeli checkpoint in December 2023. Although
  officially still married, she was raising them alone, so when she was taken
  away the children were on their own. She realised in interrogation that
  officers had confused her husband, a farmer, with a Hamas member of the same
  name. One conceded his error after comparing photographs, she said, but she
  was kept in jail for six more weeks. Israeli troops deployed to guard
  Palestinians often opposed releasing civilians cleared of any Hamas links, an
  Israeli stationed at a military facility said. They wanted to hold them
  indefinitely as leverage in hostage negotiations. “We kept releasing people
  ‘for free’, and it made [soldiers] angry,” the source said. “[The soldiers]
  would say: ‘They’re not returning hostages, so why should we let them go?’”
  Israeli politicians have expressed similar sentiments. When Mohammed Abu
  Salmiya, the director of Gaza’s Shifa hospital, was released last year, Simcha
  Rothman, chair of the Knesset’s constitution, law and justice committee,
  complained that he was freed “not in exchange for hostages”. Rights groups
  suspect this approach has unofficially been a driver of mass detentions
  throughout the war. “Even before 7 October, Israel withheld the bodies of
  hundreds of Palestinians, using them as bargaining chips instead of returning
  them to their families for burial,” said a spokesperson for Al Mezan. “We
  believe the thousands of civilians from Gaza now in detention are likewise
  intended to be used as bargaining chips.” The majority of people held as
  unlawful combatants are also effectively kept incommunicado, deepening anguish
  for both those in jail and their loved ones in Gaza. When Ghaban was released,
  she found her children begging in the street. “They were alive, but seeing the
  state they had been in for 53 days without me broke me,” she said. “I wished I
  had remained in prison rather than seeing them like that.” The unlawful
  combatants legislation has been used to facilitate the “forced disappearance
  of hundreds and even thousands of people”, said Jessica Montell, the director
  of the legal rights organisation HaMoked. Nesreen Deifallah spent months
  searching for her 16-year-old son, Moatasem, who went to look for food on 3
  December 2024 and never came home, even checking decomposed corpses in
  hospital morgues in case she recognised his clothes. In August a recently
  freed detainee told Deifallah he had been held with Moatasem. “I fainted when
  I learned that my son was still alive,” she said. Still she cannot confirm
  where he is, or contact Moatasem, who was sick, according to the man. By
  August Israel’s prison service held a record 2,662 unlawful combatants, data
  obtained by HaMoked showed. An unknown number more are in military detention
  facilities. One Israeli officer who led mass arrest operations in Khan Younis
  said soldiers saw no difference “between a terrorist who entered Israel on 7
  October and someone working for the water authority in Khan Younis”.
