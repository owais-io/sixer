  A Berlin court has convicted a Syrian teenager of contributing to an Islamic
  State-inspired plot to attack a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna. Three dates in
  the US pop star’s record-breaking Eras tour were cancelled last summer after
  authorities learned of the plot. The 16-year-old defendant, named by
  prosecutors as Mohammad A, was found guilty of “preparing a serious act of
  violence endangering the state” and “supporting a terrorist act abroad”. He
  was given an 18-month suspended sentence. Mohammad A, who was 14 at the time
  of the foiled attack, had been “radicalised by IS [Islamic State] propaganda
  on the internet”, the court said. He was found guilty of providing support to
  another teenager in Austria in plotting the atrocity. “The defendant sent him
  a video with instructions on how to build a bomb and put him in contact with
  an IS member,” the court said. Mohammad A made a full confession during the
  trial. The Vienna leg of Swift’s tour was called off last August after two
  people were arrested over an apparent plot to launch an attack on a public
  event in the Austrian capital. Authorities said they had arrested a
  19-year-old man for allegedly planning an attack in the Vienna region and
  suggested that Swift’s shows had been the “focus” of the plot. The 19-year-old
  suspect intended “to kill himself and a large crowd of people”, said Omar
  Haijawi-Pirchner, the head of state protection and intelligence at the
  Austrian interior ministry, at the time. Austrian authorities have detained
  three suspects over the plot, which was thwarted with the help of US
  intelligence – all of them teenagers at the time. The main suspect is an
  Austrian with North Macedonian roots who has confessed that he “intended to
  carry out an attack using explosives and knives”, according to Austrian
  intelligence. Police first took Mohammad A into custody last September in the
  eastern city of Frankfurt an der Oder, where the then 15-year-old went to
  school. Swift later wrote on social media that “the reason for the
  cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of
  guilt because so many had planned on coming to those shows”. German
  authorities have reported increasing radicalisation of younger suspects among
  the far-right and radical left as well as among Islamic extremists.
