  Nigel Farage is “failing a generation of young women” with his plans to scrap
  the Online Safety Act, Angela Rayner has said, arguing the move would cause an
  increase in the prevalence of “revenge porn”. The comments by the deputy prime
  minister are the latest criticism of Farage from the government, with Labour
  launching a parallel series of attack adverts on the Reform UK leader,
  including one showing him alongside the misogynist influencer Andrew Tate. In
  a press conference at the end of last month, Reform promised to scrap the act,
  which had just come into force, saying measures intended to push social media
  companies to limit false and potentially harmful content would instead bring
  censorship and make the UK “a borderline dystopian state”. In response, the
  science and technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of being on the
  side of child abusers such as Jimmy Savile, bringing a furious response from
  the Reform leader. In comments to the Sunday Telegraph, Rayner highlighted
  what she said would be the risks of getting rid of the act in terms of
  clamping down on what is formally known as intimate image abuse, where
  offenders either upload intimate pictures or footage of others or else share
  them via other means. “Intimate image abuse is a devastating crime and
  contributes to a vile misogynistic culture on social media that we know
  translates into physical spaces too,” Rayner told the paper. “Nigel Farage
  risks failing a generation of young women with his dangerous and irresponsible
  plans to scrap online safety laws. Scrapping safeguards and having no viable
  alternative plan in place to halt the floodgates of abuse that could open is
  an appalling dereliction of duty. “It’s time for Farage to tell women and
  girls across Britain how he would keep them safe online.” Labour is launching
  a linked series of online adverts against Farage, including one published on
  Sunday morning connected to Rayner’s comments. “Nigel Farage wants to make it
  easier to share revenge porn online,” it says, alongside an image of Farage
  grinning. According to the Sunday Times, another advert will highlight
  Farage’s comments about Tate, the influencer who, along with his brother,
  Tristan, faces charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm and human
  trafficking. The two British Americans are also under investigation in
  Romania, facing a number of charges. They deny all charges in both countries.
  The Labour advert shows Farage with Andrew Tate and the headline: “Nigel
  Farage says Andrew Tate is an ‘important voice’ for men.” The comments come
  from an interview Farage did on the Strike It Big podcast last year. Laila
  Cunningham, a former magistrate who has joined Reform, wrote a Telegraph
  article on Saturday in which she called the Online Safety Act “censorship
  laws”, saying laws already existed to combat “revenge porn”. “It’s a cover for
  censorship, and an excuse to hand unelected regulators sweeping powers to
  silence views they don’t like, while doing nothing about the real crimes
  happening on our streets,” she wrote. Cunningham said ministers should instead
  focus on detaining asylum seekers rather than putting them in hotels, saying
  that for now women “are being put in harm’s way” as the asylum seekers could
  pose a risk to them.
