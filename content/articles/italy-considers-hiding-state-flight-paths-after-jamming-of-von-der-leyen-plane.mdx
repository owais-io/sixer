  Italy is considering keeping state flights secret after the satellite signal
  of the aircraft carrying the European Commission president, Ursula von der
  Leyen, was allegedly jammed by Russia, Italian defence ministry sources said.
  Von der Leyen, a fierce critic of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and
  Moscow’s war in Ukraine, was flying to Bulgaria on Sunday when her charter
  plane lost satellite navigation aids, delaying its arrival in Plovdiv, and
  reportedly forcing it to circle an airport for an hour. After the incident, EU
  member states are debating how to make leaders’ flights more secure, as GPS
  jamming and “spoofing”, an electronic warfare tactic that causes incorrect
  navigation information to be displayed, have increased since Russia’s
  full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and escalated even more sharply in the
  past year. Defence officials said Rome was weighing plans to classify state
  flights, minimise the information published on the website of the prime
  minister’s office and prevent specialised tracking sites from making aircraft
  paths visible. Italy’s defence minister, Guido Crosetto, first floated this
  proposal several months ago when interference with satellite navigation
  started becoming increasingly common in airspace near Russia. In August,
  Latvia’s electronic communications office said it had identified at least
  three jamming hotspots along borders with Russia. In April 2024, a Finnish
  airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu after
  jamming, while in March that year a plane carrying the British defence
  secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory. A
  2011 decree requires that information on Italian ministers’ movements,
  particularly flights, be published on the government website. Although the
  government would still be obliged to secure diplomatic clearance to fly over
  another country’s airspace, sources told the Guardian that Italy, “while
  respecting that protocol … could soon decide not to make such flights public”.
  In February, the Italian prime minister’s plane was removed from Flightradar,
  one of the most widely used apps to provide real-time data on aircraft
  movements, but it remains visible on equivalent sites. For security reasons,
  officials are now considering “shielding flights carrying the prime minister
  and cabinet ministers from all such platforms”, sources said. The Associated
  Press has plotted almost 80 incidents on a map, tracking a campaign of
  disruption across Europe blamed on Russia – which the head of Britain’s
  foreign intelligence service described as staggeringly reckless. Russia has
  denied it was behind the failure of the navigation system on von der Leyen’s
  flight. “Your information is incorrect,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry
  Peskov, said on Monday. On Tuesday, Nato’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, said
  he was taking the jamming of GPS signals “very seriously”. He said the
  alliance was working “day and night” to prevent jamming and ensure “they will
  not do it again”.
