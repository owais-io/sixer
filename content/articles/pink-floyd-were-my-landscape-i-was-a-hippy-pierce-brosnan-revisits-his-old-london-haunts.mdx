  It is a weekday morning and I am standing beside Pierce Brosnan on a deserted
  backstreet, watching a woman in a hairnet and white wellies hosing down the
  entrance to a fishmarket. The former James Bond is in full flow. “You know the
  scene in MobLand where I’ve got my foot on that guy’s throat and Tom Hardy is
  shooting the shit out of everyone?” He is talking in his rich, buttery burr
  about the recent series in which he and Helen Mirren play the heads of an
  Irish crime family. “We shot that right here!” He waves at the woman, who
  silences her hose temporarily. “Hi, hello,” he calls out. “I shot a television
  show here called MobLand.” She smiles back at him. “Yes,” she replies sweetly,
  as though indulging a confused uncle. “No idea, has she?” he chuckles. The
  hose springs back to life with a hiss. Brosnan, 72, was raised in Navan,
  County Meath but is now generally to be found at one of his homes in Hawaii or
  Malibu, and is in London for the release of The Thursday Murder Club, the film
  adaptation of Richard Osman’s cosy crime bestseller. Brosnan teams up with
  Mirren, Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie as retirement-home sleuths whose weekly
  divertissement solving historical cold cases turns serious when fresh corpses
  start popping up. Today, he has agreed to a one-off meeting of the Wednesday
  Nostalgia Club, strolling around the area of north London where he cut his
  teeth and earned his stripes. “Down the lane of memory,” he says cheerily. Our
  first port of call is Camden Arts Projects, the Grade II-listed former
  Methodist church that was once the site of Drama Centre London. It is now an
  exhibiton and screening space , but inside Brosnan finds the same stage where
  he auditioned successfully more than half a century ago. He strides on to it
  and gazes around the vast white hall, peering up at the empty balconies as
  though picturing the ghosts of audiences past. “Coming here was the making of
  me,” he says. His snowy hair is swept back, and he looks slick and tanned. In
  1973, the year of his audition, he cut a very different figure:
  shoulder-length locks, goatee, earring. When he arrived at theDrama Centre, he
  already had several years’ experience of experimental theatre at the Ovalhouse
  theatre, now Brixton House, in Kennington. That spell on the fringes informed
  his performance in The Thursday Murder Club as “Red” Ron, a former trade
  unionist. “I recognised Ron because of my days in street theatre and agitprop.
  Theatre companies performing outside the Ford factory, all that stuff.” What
  he lacked was formal training. He auditioned first for Webber Douglas, another
  drama school. “I was so nervous, I fell off the stage. When I got to the Drama
  Centre, I thought: ‘Pay attention, Brosnan.’” Armed with a soliloquy from
  Macbeth, he impressed the centre’s co-founder, Christopher Fettes, who became
  his teacher and mentor. Fettes, who died last year at 94, once said it was
  “shocking” that Brosnan left the stage behind for cinema. Then again, he also
  considered James Bond to be “a bit below” Brosnan’s talents. The actor
  concedes the first point. “Christopher wanted me doing obscure 19th-century
  plays, but my dream was always movies.” Daniel Craig, Brosnan’s immediate
  successor as 007, made a point of returning to theatre. “I was impressed that
  Daniel had the bottle to go back out there. I thought, ‘Why the heck didn’t
  I?’ You have to really want it, and I didn’t.” Was Fettes right about Bond
  being beneath him? “It’s very kind of Christopher. But thank God for Bond.
  It’s given me longevity. It’s given me the world in many respects.” As if to
  prove his point, he steps outside into the morning light and dons his spiffy
  Jacques Marie Mage sunglasses. “I didn’t pay for these. They were free. My son
  said: ‘Oh my God, Dad. They start at 700 bucks.’” Brosnan played Bond four
  times, beginning with the impressive GoldenEye in 1995 and ending seven years
  later with the risible Die Another Day. He had a unique challenge: his
  incarnation was the first to be asked to reckon with the chauvinistic sins of
  Bonds gone by. He had to uphold the character’s heroism in between occasional
  bites of humble pie. Bond had figured in Brosnan’s life here and there before
  he got to play him. There was a cinema trip with his stepfather to see
  Goldfinger at the ABC Putney in September 1964. The previous month,
  11-year-old Brosnan was reunited with his mother after living with relatives
  in Ireland while she completed her nursing training in London. “I later
  discovered that Ian Fleming died in August, the same month I got here.” He
  raises both eyebrows in a manner that wouldn’t have disgraced Roger Moore.
  When Moore vacated the role in the late 1980s, it was Brosnan’s for the
  taking. Except the network behind his US television hit Remington Steele, in
  which he was charming as a conman turned detective, refused to release him
  from his contract. His loss was Timothy Dalton’s gain, at least for a few
  years. Our next stop is the Roundhouse, the live music venue and former
  theatre where Brosnan starred in the British premiere of Tennessee Williams’
  The Red Devil Battery Sign in June 1977. The playwright personally promoted
  Brosnan, originally an understudy, to the main cast. “On opening night, he
  sent me a telegram: ‘Thank God for you, my dear boy. Love, Tennessee
  Williams.’” It must have made up for having his name misspelt on the posters
  as “Pierce Brosman”, I suggest. He responds with a rueful laugh. The security
  guard at the Roundhouse looks unfazed when I tell him who I have with me, but
  permits us to nose around anyway. “I remember finishing the show one night and
  bumping into Tennessee,” says Brosnan as we loiter in the foyer. “He couldn’t
  find his way out of the theatre, so he held my arm and I walked him to his
  driver.” Williams died six years later at 71. “Well, he liked a tipple. You
  would go to his house at night and everyone would be at his feet while he
  regaled us with these lyrical stories.” A pause. “None of which I can recall
  because I was tippling, too.” The Red Devil Battery Sign opened exactly a week
  after the release of the Sex Pistols’ God Save the Queen. “Punk wasn’t my
  bailiwick,” he says. “Pink Floyd were part of my landscape of learning and
  transformation. I was a hippy.” Around his neck is a string of beads which may
  or may not be the ones given to him by a monk 15 years ago during a nasty bit
  of turbulence on a private plane. To finish our conversation, we head to a
  pavement cafe in nearby Primrose Hill, where Brosnan admires the dogs trotting
  by. This prompts a brief reverie on his favourite Instagram video. “It’s a guy
  who dresses his dog in a hoodie and then puts his own hands through the
  sleeves, so it looks like the dog has hands.” He sips his latte. “It’s really
  quite brilliant.” We get back to the topic of The Thursday Murder Club.
  Brosnan still isn’t sure why Chris Columbus, who directed him in Mrs Doubtfire
  and Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, thought of him for Ron. “Chris just
  said: ‘Grow a beard.’ So I did.” Columbus isn’t the only blast from Brosnan’s
  past in the new movie. Decades before MobLand, he and Mirren appeared in The
  Long Good Friday, though they didn’t share any scenes. Whereas Brosnan and
  Paul Freeman, who stars in The Thursday Murder Club as a vet whose wife is
  dying, have got “previous” – as the East End hoods of that 1980 thriller would
  put it. “It was my first film,” Brosnan sighs. “I wasn’t given a script. My
  agent said: ‘Get down to Lewisham bath and take your trunks.’ And there was
  Paul.” The Thursday Murder Club brings them together for the first time since
  Brosnan had the temerity to stab Freeman to death in the swimming baths. It
  also puts Brosnan back in his trunks again for a water aerobics workout to
  Disco Inferno. “Some people think I give one of my best performances in The
  Long Good Friday,” he muses. Because he doesn’t have any lines? “Exactly!
  Don’t give me any lines. Just tell me: look camera left, look camera right.”
  And brood. “Yes. That’s me. Broody Brosnan.” Possibly Brosnan’s smartest moves
  during his Bond tenure were to make canny choices between 007 films. He had
  his head detached from his body in Mars Attacks! and kissed Sarah Jessica
  Parker, who had had hers attached to a chihuahua. Then he flashed his bum and
  got doused in champagne by Rene Russo in the smart, snazzy remake of The
  Thomas Crown Affair, and was gleefully untrustworthy as a crooked MI6 agent in
  The Tailor of Panama. (The late Observer film critic Philip French considered
  Brosnan “better at coarse, sleazy charm than suave sophistication”.) This
  meant he had less baggage to shake off after Die Another Day. The world
  already knew he was more than just a walking tuxedo. Very clever, Mr Bond. In
  fact, it’s one of Brosnan’s tips for whoever plays the role next. “It’s
  essential to be creative outside of Bond,” he says. Any other advice? “Get a
  good lawyer.” His eclecticism has continued, whether it means painting his
  toenails as a gone-to-seed hitman in The Matador, belting his lungs out in
  Mamma Mia! or returning to the intelligence agencies, as boss rather than
  foot-soldier in Steven Soderbergh’s witty thriller Black Bag, in which he
  barked at Michael Fassbender and sparked with Cate Blanchett. Talking of
  which, wasn’t Blanchett astonishing, he says, in the recent production of The
  Seagull at the Barbican? “I was bedazzled! The friend I was with said, ‘You’ve
  got to go round and congratulate her. She’ll know you’re in.’ So we joined the
  queue. Barricades, the lot. The guy on the door said: ‘Are you on the list?’
  My friend said: ‘This is Pierce Brosnan!’ There were tourists snapping away,
  taking my picture. ‘Sorry, mate. Not on the list. Can’t come in.’ My friend
  was getting indignant. I said: ‘Walk away.’ I sent Cate a note instead. She
  was mortified.” Security guards and fishmongers alike may not recognise him.
  But once Brosnan has been whisked off to his next appointment, a family of
  American tourists call out to me as I’m paying the bill: “Was that Pierce
  Brosnan? Wow!” Proof that his star hasn’t dimmed. If only he’d been there to
  get the benefit. • The Thursday Murder Club is streaming on Netflix
