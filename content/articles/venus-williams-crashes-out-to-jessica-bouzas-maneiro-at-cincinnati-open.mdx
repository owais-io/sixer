  For the 1,099th time in her career, Venus Williams took her place on the
  baseline before a tennis match and prepared to do battle. As has been the case
  almost every time she has competed for the last 31 years, Williams fought hard
  until the end, but there was no fairytale outcome in the midwest. After two
  competitive sets on Centre Court, the in-form Spaniard Jessica Bouzas Maneiro
  knocked out Williams in the first round of the Cincinnati Open with a 6-4, 6-4
  win. Things had looked particularly bleak for the 45-year-old Williams early
  on as she struggled to keep the ball in court, quickly falling down two breaks
  at 1-4 in the opening set. At 22, Bouzas Maneiro has been on the rise in
  recent months and her ranking of 51 belies a run of form that includes a
  fourth round at Wimbledon followed by a quarter-final in Montreal last week.
  The Spaniard showed her quality by remaining solid from the baseline,
  maintaining consistent depth, offering up few errors and looking for
  opportunities to redirect Williams’ pace. “I could hear their dismay as the
  set score started to look dismal in the first set,” Williams said, smiling.
  “But I’m thinking: ‘Folks, it’s not over. This is just the beginning.’ So we
  got to 4-4 and you can hear the excitement as well. It’s, very, very exciting
  to play at home. It’s just an honour.” Williams gradually found her rhythm and
  fought hard, retrieving both breaks as she dragged herself level in the
  opening set. She produced her best stretch of tennis in the second set, using
  her forehand to bully the Spaniard from the baseline and demonstrating the
  enduring quality she possesses with her destructive first serve to lead 4-3.
  In the final stages of both sets, however, Bouzas Maneiro’s shot tolerance,
  defence and composure under pressure determined the match. While a first-round
  loss at any event was once a setback for a player of Williams’ calibre and
  record, at 45 years old and after competing so sparsely in recent years, her
  expectations are low. While her victory over the world No 35 Peyton Stearns in
  Washington DC last month was a major achievement, she also left the court
  happy with how she had played on Thursday and she enjoyed the sensation of
  battling on the court again. Once again, Williams, who had already won four
  grand slam titles and reached No 1 by the time her opponent was born, was
  competitive, fought hard and did not look out of place against a talented
  player in one of the biggest tournaments in the world. “Right now it’s hard
  for me to be upset,” said Williams. “Of course, I want to win the match, but
  it’s hard for me to be [sad]. If you’re on tour, day in, day out and you lose
  a match, you’re like: ‘Man, I had some chances.’ I know that I lost this match
  because I just need more matches. After this match, I’m just thinking: ‘OK,
  what am I going to work on?’ instead of: ‘Gosh, I screwed that up.’ “Yes, I
  could have played better. But the thing I feel good about is that I did go for
  it. No one dunked on my head. She definitely had some great shots, but I went
  for it, and sometimes they didn’t land, and sometimes she had some great
  shots. But it’s not that I didn’t know what to do. It’s just that I need to
  keep working on it.” After 10 days of practice, Williams will next compete in
  the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament alongside Reilly Opelka and she
  will surely also receive a singles main draw wildcard. Although it would make
  sense at her age for the US Open to mark her final grand slam appearance,
  Williams has shown for three decades that her next move is impossible to
  predict. Elsewhere, Coco Gauff said she is willing to exhaust her energy
  reserves in service of winning her second grand slam title of the season at
  the US Open. “It feels like I’m pushing that nitro button and just leaving it
  all out there. This is the part of the season that I feel like you’re just
  like: ‘I just want to give it literally everything.’” In the men’s draw, Jacob
  Fearnley, the British No 3, fell 6-1, 6-4 to Zizou Bergs of Belgium in the
  first round.
