  They stood together like old friends, heads thrown back in jovial laughter,
  clutching one another’s hands affectionately. Except this was no ordinary
  gathering of three men, but a meeting of three of the most powerful
  non-western leaders: Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi. The overt
  displays of intimacy were widely regarded by observers as a telling message of
  defiance aimed at their western counterparts, in particular Donald Trump, who
  just a few days earlier had slapped India with 50% import tariffs, among the
  harshest of the US president’s trade penalties. “India likes other great
  powers to know that New Delhi has options,” said Christopher Clary, an
  associate professor of political science at University at Albany, State
  University of New York. “One advantage of being in lots of clubs is you can
  make high-profile entrances to those clubs if you’re upset with how things are
  going in other relationships.” This was Modi’s first visit to China in seven
  years and the hostilities that had come to define the countries’ relationship
  in recent years were nowhere to be seen. Instead, as the Indian prime minister
  arrived in China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, he received
  a far more effusive welcome from the Chinese premier than most guests were
  granted. The leaders’ brotherly encounter in the city of Tianjin did not go
  unnoticed in the Oval Office. Hours after the meeting, Trump went on another
  tirade against India, calling trade with the country a “one-sided disaster”,
  while his trade adviser Peter Navarro said in a social media post: “It is a
  shame to see Modi getting in bed with Xi Jinping and Putin. I’m not sure what
  he’s thinking.” Even a year ago, such a scene between Modi and Xi was
  difficult to imagine. The two countries had remained in a hostile military
  standoff since 2020 after China’s rapid encroachments and troop incursions
  along its mountainous Himalayan border with India led to a violent clash
  between soldiers on the two sides. It was followed by a mammoth mobilisation
  of military personnel, infrastructure and weapons along both sides of the
  border. Anti-China sentiment ran rampant in India, with hundreds of Chinese
  apps – including TikTok – banned and Chinese companies prevented from
  investing in India. The US had seized upon the tensions to cultivate its close
  ties with India further, viewing the country as a critical counterweight to
  China’s rise. Yet Trump’s own foreign policy position has accelerated
  something of a geopolitical repositioning. The US, once seen as an unshakable
  ally to India, is now viewed in New Delhi as a turbulent, even hostile
  adversary. The double tariffs on India, which Trump announced without warning,
  appear to be a punishment after falling out with Modi, who refused to credit
  the US president with halting possible nuclear war between India and Pakistan
  in May. Particular umbrage was taken in New Delhi at Trump’s attempts to use
  tariffs to shape India’s policies. Meanwhile, China has observed the
  alienation of New Delhi and Washington with overt glee and made it clear its
  priority now is a complete normalisation of Indo-Chinese ties. During Modi’s
  China visit, he and Xi agreed to friendlier relations, which include
  stabilising their border and reopening their economies to each other. Speaking
  on Sunday, Xi said it was “vital to be friends, a good neighbour, and the
  dragon and the elephant to come together”. As analysts emphasised, the
  beginning of a rapprochement between India and China pre-dated Trump’s second
  term. Nonetheless, the prospect of a second unpredictable Trump term had been
  seen by many as a driver for China’s sudden willingness to discuss
  disengagement with India. “This meeting was a partial response to Trump’s
  tariff tantrum,” said Clary. “The core reality for India is that it does not
  have enough military capability to be confident of how an India-China fight
  would go. In this Trumpian world, India may not be able to find an outside
  ally that it can depend on and so it needs to make sure the India-China
  relationship is calm.” Before the 2020 clashes, Modi had been seen as gung-ho
  in strengthening the India-China relationship, hosting Xi in India just a few
  months after being elected prime minister in 2014. Harsh V Pant, a professor
  of international relations at King’s College London’s India Institute, said it
  was likely the two leaders would try to revert the relationship to how it had
  been five years ago, despite the border remaining a challenge. Even with the
  risk of infuriating its western allies, analysts emphasised India had a lot to
  gain from bettering ties with China. Much of India’s manufacturing, which Modi
  is trying to boost, is reliant on materials and rare earths from China. China,
  meanwhile, stands to gain economically if it regains access to India’s market.
  However, Pant emphasised that there were still significant limitations on the
  India-China relationship beyond the border tensions. China remains a major
  backer and supplier of weapons to Pakistan – widely seen as a way to keep
  India’s regional power in check – and it was Chinese jets and weaponry that
  were used against India during the India-Pakistan hostilities in May. “It
  would be a mistake to view this as some kind of a grand rapprochement between
  India and China,” he said. “In India, the trust deficit with China is still
  very, very high and there are enough pressure points that will keep the
  relationship a bit tenuous.”
