webTitle: Concessions review – moviegoer melancholy for Michael Madsen’s final film
sectionName: Film
webPublicationDate: '2025-08-15T20:00:41Z'
bodyText: >-
  The late Michael Madsen makes his final, posthumous appearance as a boozy
  stuntman called Rex Fuel in this laidback ensemble film from feature
  first-timer Mas Bouzidi, a piece of moviegoing melancholy developed from the
  director’s short of the same title. Bouzidi gives us the time-honoured
  scenario of a smalltown movie theatre’s last day before closing down,
  resonantly named the Royal Alamo and showing for its last stand a couple of
  films on 35mm. The place has been stricken, of course, by the prevalence of
  digital streaming, although the wistful mood doesn’t seem too different from
  Bogdanovich’s The Last Picture Show from 1971, when Netflix wasn’t a problem.
  The Royal Alamo is now a bittersweet place of memories whose spirit is perhaps
  epitomised by the two guys listlessly working at the concessions stand, and
  bickering amusingly like Kevin Smith’s Clerks. (“That movie where Johnny Depp
  played the creepy paedophile … ”, “Willy Wonka?”, “Yeah”) The title might
  imply that some concessions are metaphorical. Perhaps doing a dull job is a
  concession made in return for privileged access to the dream factory. One is
  Hunter (Rob Riordan), who can’t believe he’s been wasting his life working
  here since high school and at one moment has the humiliation of having to
  serve a guy in his class who is now a big deal. Hunter does not, in fact,
  watch the movies showing at the Royal Alamo, although his final moments are
  not, in fact, too dissimilar from those of Olivia Colman in Sam Mendes’s
  sadness-of-cinema film Empire of Light. The other concessions guy is Lorenzo
  (Jonathan Lorenzo Price) who has a football scholarship at Tampa, Florida and
  so unlike all these other losers, he has a ticket out of this no-hope small
  town, but confides his own anxieties to Deana (Lana Rockwell) who sells
  tickets. The place is managed by grumpy Luke (Steven Ogg) whose dad built the
  place in the early 1970s. Madsen has a cameo playing Fuel, who resembles a
  character deleted from Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood: a cheerful,
  bleary guy who wanders in and asks Deana – whom he calls “Toots” – for a free
  ticket to the movie they’re showing because he did the stunts on it; he
  cordially sidles up to a woman in the auditorium and presents her with his
  card, in case she should need a stuntman. This good-natured appearance
  redoubles the film’s cinephile tristesse and its ancestor-worship, although
  maybe this rather familiar subject needs an injection of new ideas that
  Concessions, however amiable, does not really provide. • Concessions screened
  at the Edinburgh film festival.
