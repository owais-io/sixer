  The controversial felony conviction of a peaceful climate activist has been
  overturned by an appeals court due to “pervasive” prosecutorial misconduct.
  Mylene Vialard, 56, was found guilty of felony obstruction in 2023 for her
  role in trying to halt construction of a fossil-fuel pipeline through
  Indigenous territory in Minnesota, in a trial beset by irregularities. Vialard
  was charged after attaching herself to a 25ft bamboo tower erected to block a
  pumping station in Aitkin county in August 2021, as part of a crackdown on
  non-violent Indigenous-led protests opposing the expansion and re-routing on
  Line 3 – a 1,097-mile tar sands oil pipeline with a dismal safety record that
  crosses more than 200 bodies of water from Alberta in Canada to refineries in
  the US midwest. According to legal groups representing the activists, Vialard
  was among more than a thousand people arrested by Minnesota law enforcement –
  which along with other agencies reportedly received at least $8.6m in payments
  from the Canadian company Enbridge, which is behind Line 3. On Monday, the
  conviction was overturned and a new trial ordered by the Minnesota court of
  appeals. “Weighing the relevant factors, we conclude that the prosecutorial
  misconduct conceded to by the state was not harmless beyond a reasonable
  doubt. The state’s evidence against Vialard was not particularly strong, the
  misconduct was pervasive, and the district court’s instructions did not cure
  any prejudicial effect of the misconduct,” the three-judge panel found. “We
  therefore conclude that the prosecutor failed to meet his affirmative
  obligation to ensure that Vialard received a fair trial, and instead sought a
  conviction at any price. Accordingly, Vialard is entitled to a new trial,” the
  written judgement concluded. Vialard and her legal team welcomed the ruling.
  “It is everyone’s role to resist bullies and protect the only world we have
  that can feed and provide for all of us humans and non-humans,” Vialard told
  the Guardian in a statement. “I’m glad that the appellate court recognized the
  plethora of misconduct from the prosecution and the judge during my trial and
  acknowledged the fact that the prosecutorial arguments that led to my guilty
  verdict were weak at best. But let’s not forget that we were fighting the
  heavy polluter that is Enbridge, and that fight continues,” Vialard said.
  “This case involved egregious, pervasive misconduct, and we’re glad the court
  of appeals recognized that Mylene was robbed of a fair trial in this case,”
  said Claire Glenn, one of Vialard’s attorneys from the Climate Defense
  Project. “This system is supposed to be about accountability, but too often
  prosecutors are not held accountable.” The Aitkin county attorney’s office has
  been contacted for comment. The week-long trial in August 2021 was beset by
  delays and legal arguments amid multiple alleged violations by the
  prosecution. In one incident, a sheriff’s deputy was caught broadcasting the
  Zoom audio from inside the courtroom into the public hallways of the
  courthouse, which is used by jurors and witnesses alike – in violation of
  sequestration rules and the court’s own pre-trial order barring public Zoom
  access to the trial. In court, the prosecutor incorrectly claimed Vialard was
  not an American citizen – she was born in France – and that she had been
  trespassing when arrested, despite having been repeatedly admonished by the
  judge as a trespass charge was previously dismissed. Nevertheless, Vialard was
  found guilty and had been facing a 12-month jail sentence. At the time, she
  told the Guardian that she had “no regrets”. Overall, at least 967 criminal
  charges were filed, including several people charged under the state’s new
  critical infrastructure protection legislation – approved as part of a wave of
  anti-protest laws inspired by the American Legislative Exchange Council
  (Alec), a rightwing group backed by fossil-fuel companies. This included Jill
  Ferguson, a 70-year-old grandmother from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was found
  guilty of obstructing legal process (interference with a peace officer), a
  misdemeanour, and sentenced to two days in prison with time served for her
  role in a protest in July 2021 in Clearwater county. “I am guilty. Guilty of
  protecting the headwaters of the Mississippi river, so this is a badge of
  honor,” Ferguson told the Guardian at the time.
