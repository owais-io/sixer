  Wildlife groups have condemned a decision by regulators in Florida to allow
  the hunting of black bears for the first time in a decade, and to permit
  “barbaric” practices including the use of bait traps, archery and dog packs.
  The unanimous vote by the Florida fish and wildlife conservation commission
  (FWC) on Wednesday to approve a limited hunting season in December followed a
  presentation from staff insisting that a rising bear population and increasing
  encounters with humans warranted a reduction in numbers. In May, officials
  investigated what was believed to be the first fatal mauling of a person by a
  black bear in the state. But many protesters who spoke at the FWC meeting in
  Havana said the decision turned back the clock on decades of recovery of the
  once endangered species. They criticized the hunt as “legalized animal
  cruelty”, and said commissioners were using flawed science to justify its
  approval, including estimates of bear numbers instead of a formal census that
  will not be complete for another five years. “This ill-conceived bear hunt
  will endanger an already threatened animal and open the door to destruction of
  critical wilderness habitat throughout Florida,” Susannah Randolph, chapter
  director of the Sierra Club, told the panel. “Is our future one of pictures of
  trophy hunters standing over dead animals in vast concrete parking lots?
  [Florida governor] Ron DeSantis could stop this hunt right now and leave an
  enduring legacy for our children and grandchildren.” More than 160 members of
  the public spoke at the highly charged meeting that in effect rubber-stamped
  rules approved provisionally by commissioners in May. FWC will issue permits
  for the cull of 187 bears, almost 5% of Florida’s estimated total of 4,000,
  over a 23-day hunt starting 6 December in four subpopulations where numbers
  are considered to be healthy. Several speakers said methods of hunting that
  will be permitted – including bows and arrows, luring bears with food traps,
  and setting trained dogs on their prey beginning in 2027 – belied the state’s
  assertion that it was a conservation measure. The use of hounds is allowed in
  only 17 of the 32 states that permit bear hunting. “It’s just slaughter and
  torture,” said Adam Sugalski, founder of the wildlife advocacy group Bear
  Defenders. “Using dogs is legalized animal cruelty. The dogs will be phased in
  over the next few years after they’re trained, meaning in the off-season you
  can just run your dogs to the woods and chase bears just for fun, and kill
  them.” Others pointed to the 2015 debacle of Florida’s most recent hunt, which
  was halted prematurely when 300 bears were killed inside 48 hours, and
  hunters, including an FWC commissioner who had voted to approve it, were
  accused of illegally killing pregnant bears, new mothers and cubs. Steve
  Meyers, an attorney who worked on a lawsuit to try to prevent that hunt, noted
  on Wednesday that all seven current FWC commissioners were appointed or
  reconfirmed by DeSantis. “The imagery of a Ron DeSantis bear hunt is not going
  to be a harvest, it’s going to be the lifeless bodies of black bears hanging
  upside down with blood pouring out of their mouths,” he said. “The media
  doesn’t need pictures from this hunt. The ones from the last hunt will be just
  fine. Ron DeSantis’s face will be wedded to that imagery.” George Warthen, the
  FWC’s director of hunting and game management, conceded that the public
  response to the May vote was “significant and divided”, and appeared to
  suggest the hunt was more of a pre-emptive move than a response to any
  existing problem. “A highly regulated hunt would prevent negative future
  impacts of overpopulation,” he said. “Hunting at feeding stations and with
  dogs would provide hunters with the opportunity to selectively harvest larger
  male bears and avoid harvesting females, or females with young bears.” The
  decision is the latest in a series of developments wildlife advocates see as
  detrimental to a slowly recovering black bear population that was as low as a
  few hundred in the 1970s. They include DeSantis signing into law last year a
  measure allowing residents to kill without fear of repercussion any bear
  perceived to pose a threat to their families, pets or property.
  Conservationists have attempted to raise awareness of the challenges facing
  black bears in Florida, most notably deaths from vehicle strikes, and loss of
  habitat through development. Carlton Ward Jr, an environmentalist who helped
  found the Florida Wildlife Corridor in 2010 to allow the free movement of
  vulnerable animals, said black bears were still fragmented in Florida across
  seven subpopulations, some of which had not recovered as well as others. Ward
  and director KT Bryden’s documentary Florida Bear Tracks, produced by his
  nature storytelling company Wildpath for the National Geographic Society,
  chronicles the habitat issues by following an all-female team of FWC workers
  trapping and tagging bears in south Florida. “We appreciate all the public
  attention Florida black bears are getting and will be getting around this
  controversial bear hunt, and we also recognize that the bigger story of who
  Florida black bears are, and where they live, is likely to be left out of this
  conversation,” Ward said. “Bears are not thriving everywhere they need to be.
  We actually need more bears in Florida, in more places, to have the stated
  goal of a genetically connected statewide bear population.” Bryden said that
  healthy black bear populations in some of the habitats are not an indication
  that the species has recovered in the state. “There’s only around 4,000 bears
  in the state, and 23 million people. So bears are facing a lot of challenges
  with habitat loss and fragmentation. As Florida grows, we need to learn how to
  coexist with wildlife. It’s not optional. It’s essential,” she said. This
  article was amended on 14 August 2025 to identify KT Bryden as director of
  Florida Bear Tracks and correctly attribute a quote about bear populations to
  her.
