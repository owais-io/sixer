  Luca Guadagnino misfires with this bafflingly overlong, overwrought #MeToo
  campus accusation drama from screenwriter Nora Garrett, broadly in the
  tradition of David Mamet’s Oleanna or Neil LaBute’s The Shape of Things. It is
  worryingly muddled and contrived, perhaps in need of further script drafts to
  excavate a clearer and more satisfying drama inside. Julia Roberts and Ayo
  Edebiri star, with Andrew Garfield and Michael Stuhlbarg in supporting roles;
  they are all doing their considerable best, each frankly hampered by the
  unfocused and uncertain characterisation in the material itself, which, by the
  time it finally reaches its coda-finale of confrontation, is almost bizarrely
  inert, anticlimactic and incoherent. The movie is clenched with its own sense
  of contemporary relevance and risky blurred lines, saddled with an almost
  deafening score that often grinds straight through the dialogue; the drama
  becomes an atonal quartet of self-consciousness. One particularly weird and
  unearned mannerism is periodically introducing a pointlessly loud
  timebomb-style ticking on the soundtrack, something brought out in lieu of
  actual suspense but which never leads to anything as clear or interesting as
  an explosion. The scene is Yale University and the action is prefaced by an
  intertitle announcing “It happened at Yale …”, perhaps hinting at some
  specific true story. Guadagnino evidently had permission to film at Yale
  itself, showing locations such as the iconic Beinecke library, so Yale is
  apparently on board with the film at some level. Roberts plays Alma Imhoff, a
  brilliant and charismatic philosophy professor, a longstanding champion of
  feminist issues, idolised by her star student Maggie Price (Edebiri), whose
  parents are rich enough to make many donations. But some people, including her
  psychoanalyst husband Frederik (Stuhlbarg), whose behaviour toggles oddly
  between sweetly uxorious support and petulant complaint, think that Alma has
  unbecomingly allowed herself to be flattered by a student with a crush, and
  family wealth. Meanwhile, Alma is up for tenure, in competition with her
  flirtatious colleague Hank (Garfield), who is a close friend but perhaps wants
  to be more than that. After a boozy, daring smoking-indoors party hosted by
  Alma and Frederik, Maggie is walked back to her student accommodation by a
  clearly drunk Hank. Hours later, she reappears on Alma’s doorstep with a
  terrible accusation, which Hank denies. Alma must decide where her loyalties
  lie in this intersectional crisis. But the laboriously nurtured ambiguity and
  complexity just become an evasive and noncommittal jumble of ideas, and Alma’s
  health issues and the strange discovery that appears to kickstart the action
  look very contrived. And the scene in which Roberts puts the smackdown on an
  irritatingly woke student in class doesn’t have a fraction of the power of
  Cate Blanchett’s imperious conductor doing the same thing in Todd Field’s Tár.
  Some old-fashioned Yale rigour was needed. • After the Hunt screened at the
  Venice film festival.
