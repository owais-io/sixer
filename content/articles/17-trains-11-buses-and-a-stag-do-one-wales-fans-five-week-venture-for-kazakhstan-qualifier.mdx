  For Wales, Thursday’s World Cup qualifier against Kazakhstan presents
  challenges aplenty. In between preparing to play on an artificial surface at
  the Astana Arena, there is a balance between maximising precious time on the
  pitches and prioritising recovery. Wales took an eight-hour direct flight from
  Cardiff to Astana, avoiding Ukrainian airspace, and their only real training
  session as a full squad will be 24 hours before kick-off. Player bodyclocks
  will be programmed to a two-hour – not four-hour – time difference. One Wales
  supporter, John McAllister, spied a challenge in the fixture. His odyssey,
  inspired by the BBC’s Race Across the World, began five weeks ago when he left
  home in Barry, south Wales. Since 29 July he has been travelling from Cymru to
  Kazakhstan, the world’s ninth-largest country by land area and the largest to
  be landlocked, documenting his journey in a series of YouTube videos. The
  26-year-old has covered about 5,000km. More than 1,100 Wales fans will be at
  the game but only one, understandably, has been directly referenced by Craig
  Bellamy. “We’ve got to see him, because it means so much to us,” the Wales
  manager said. McAllister, who regularly follows Wales away, admits this is
  about as far-flung as it gets. Thursday’s match will be his 12th of the trip.
  He highlights Fenerbahce’s Champions League date with Feyenoord in Istanbul as
  his favourite owing to the supercharged atmosphere. He paid a fixer to source
  a ticket and soon found himself immersed with the locals in a park over the
  road from the stadium. “Three hours before kick-off, there’s crazy
  pyrotechnics going off,” he says. Belgrade brought three appetising games,
  while the £1.35 entry to a second-tier game in Almaty, close to the Chinese
  border and further east than Islamabad and Mumbai, also warrants a mention.
  “I’ll watch anything … my bread and butter is going to Barry Town in the Cymru
  Premier League.” McAllister ticked off France, Belgium, Germany, the
  Netherlands – and England – on his first day. Then he travelled across the
  Balkans and signed up to a 36-hour train across Turkey into Georgia. Wearing a
  Cymru T-shirt in a Tbilisi bar, shortly after photographing the Mother of
  Georgia monument, he felt an air of familiarity. “A fella taps me on the
  shoulder and says: ‘Shwmae, are you from Wales?’” McAllister says, recalling
  how he was suddenly talking to a man from Rhoose, a village located few miles
  from Barry. “It was crazy. He said: ‘I live out here and I’m going out on a
  stag do tonight. Do you fancy joining us, if you’re on your own?’ So I went on
  this Irish fella’s stag with 30 strangers.” Chacha, a Georgian brandy, went
  down a treat, and things went so swimmingly McAllister bagged an invite to the
  wedding – only it was the same day he was flying to Atyrau, northwest
  Kazakhstan. “Through gritted teeth and a lack of alternatives,” he says,
  given, ideally, he wanted to avoid air travel unless absolutely necessary. But
  the options were limited with Russia in effect out of bounds and travel
  through Iran requiring a government-approved guide at all times. The land
  border into Azerbaijan is closed, so crossing the Caspian Sea via Baku was
  also regarded off-menu. “Getting the passport stamp, actually realising I was
  in Kazakhstan, was pretty cool,” McAllister says. For Wales, second in Group J
  at the halfway stage of qualifying, Kazakhstan represents their sole
  competitive match this window; Wales host Canada in Swansea for a friendly
  next Tuesday. Last week Bellamy highlighted how “athletic and stubborn”
  Kazakhstan, 83 places below his side in the Fifa rankings, possess more
  players in the Champions League clubs than in his squad, owing to Kairat
  Almaty’s progress against Celtic. McAllister attended the second leg in
  Almaty. “We’re in a kind of can’t-drop-points situation because we’re going to
  have to go toe-to-toe with Belgium to qualify automatically. But we really
  seem to have moved forward with our style of play – the near-miss comeback
  against Belgium proved how far we’ve come. Things have been very promising
  under Bellamy.” Now after traversing east, taking in 17 trains, 11 buses, four
  time zones and plenty of beer, the rest of the Red Wall is on the horizon.
  “They are all flooding into the city,” says McAllister, who has seen Christmas
  trees in the main square in Erzurum, a Turkish city close to the Armenian
  border covered in snow for six months of the year, experienced an impromptu
  heavy-metal night on arrival in Kazakhstan and explored Vukovar, a Croatian
  city “on those dark tourism lists” after it was sieged by Yugoslavia in 1991.
  Those sceptical of his masterplan at the outset are now in awe. “I think the
  unanimous answer at the beginning was: you’re crazy,” McAllister says. “But
  since I said this was what I was doing and I’ve posted updates along the way,
  people have been fantastic. Everyone’s been very supportive and sent lots of
  encouragement. It’s been very good fun.”
