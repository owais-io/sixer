  Ministers plan to turbocharge their school improvement programme to tackle
  regional inequalities, aiming to export the success of London’s high-achieving
  pupils to England’s most struggling schools. Bridget Phillipson, the education
  secretary, said her school improvement plan was “taking the best” of the
  previous Labour government’s successful London Challenge, which revolutionised
  the city’s school system, and applying the techniques to flagging schools
  throughout England. This week’s A-level results raised alarm at the widening
  gap between results in London and regions outside the south-east of England,
  particularly in the Midlands and the north-east, where improvements in top
  grades have been stagnant. The Department for Education is to double the
  number of schools being supported by its regional improvement for standards
  and excellence (Rise) programme, which identifies “stuck schools” with
  repeated poor inspection reports, and aim to transform them through expert
  assistance from experienced school leaders and partnerships, as well as up to
  £200,000 over two years in extra funding. Phillipson said: “This week’s exam
  results were a time for celebration, but they also laid bare the yawning
  attainment gaps at A-level that continue to cast a shadow over so many areas
  of the country. “It’s appalling that young people across the north-east, the
  East Midlands and West Midlands continue to be held back compared to their
  peers in London. “That’s why, as part of our plan for change, we are putting a
  laser focus on those areas of the country, and those schools where performance
  is weakest, with our new school improvement teams – taking the best of the
  renowned London Challenge and applying it to areas like the north-east, to
  make sure that every single child, wherever they grow up, has the life chances
  they deserve.” The rollout of the Rise programme is backed by the former
  education secretary David Blunkett and Sir Kevan Collins, the government’s
  school improvement tsar, who were involved in the London Challenge after it
  was launched in 2003. Lord Blunkett applauded the early intervention in
  schools through the Rise teams, saying the policy would “narrow the gap and
  create a more equal start in life, so crucial to releasing the talent,
  creativity and self-reliance of young people”. In London, the government used
  data to identify schools with the most glaring problems, and then worked with
  local authorities to overhaul each school’s leadership and culture, while also
  working with parents and wider communities to tackle specific issues in
  boroughs such as Tower Hamlets, where Collins was a senior leader. By 2010,
  London had a higher proportion of schools rated as good or outstanding by
  Ofsted than any other area of England. The initial phase of Rise began earlier
  this year, after 600 schools were identified as urgently needing support. More
  than 200 were matched with advisers and partners, and must create an approved
  plan for transformation before receiving up to £200,000 in extra funding
  spread over two years. The DfE said a further 200 schools would be added “very
  quickly” in the autumn, when the new school year commences, as a sign of the
  government’s recognition of the urgency. Collins said: “The emphasis [of Rise]
  is all about pace, because the one thing about schools that start to decline,
  the slide becomes embedded. They can’t recruit great staff, people start
  leaving, attitudes become habitual. You need to be radical to turn that
  around, and the longer you leave it, the harder it is. This is what is so
  shameful about these schools being left like this for so long.” He added: “One
  of the things about the London Challenge was that it was very high-profile and
  with a sense of endeavour – everyone was leaning into it, it had massive
  national leadership. There was a big effort, a clear effort, and that is what
  we are trying to replicate with Rise.” Jon Coles, the director of the London
  Challenge when it launched under the leadership of Tim Brighouse, and who is
  now the chief executive of the United Learning academy trust, said: “The
  history of the London Challenge shows that you can make a big difference, that
  these things are not inevitable. “Twenty years ago, inner London performed
  less well than every region in the country. And now the only place that
  outperforms inner London is outer London. “So things can change. But it
  requires people to decide they are going to work together, have a great
  strategy, take tough decisions, collaborate beyond boundaries, in order to
  make things better for children.” Thursday’s A-level results showed the gap
  between the best- and worst-performing regions widened again this year, with
  32% of entries in London gaining the top A* or A grades, compared with fewer
  than 23% in north-east England. Young people in the north-east of England are
  also less likely to take A-levels than their peers in London and the
  south-east. Research published by the DfE in July showed that more than half
  of children in inner London eligible for free school meals at the age of 15
  went on to higher education by the age of 19, compared with 22% in the
  north-east and the east Midlands.
