  Mexico’s senate devolved into violence this week as two of the country’s top
  politicians shoved, grabbed and shouted at each other after a heated
  discussion over the presence of foreign troops. Alejandro “Alito” Moreno, head
  of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary party (Pri), grabbed at Gerardo
  Fernández Noroña, the senate president from the ruling Morena party, after
  lawmakers finished singing the national anthem to mark the end of the day’s
  session on Wednesday. “I’m asking you to let me speak,” Moreno says repeatedly
  in the livestreamed video. “Don’t touch me,” Fernández Noroña responds. When
  Fernández Noroña tries to pull himself away, Moreno can be seen grabbing at
  him again, before both lawmakers start grabbing and shoving each other, with
  Moreno even slapping Fernández Noroña on the neck. When an aide to Fernández
  Noroña steps between them, Moreno knocks him to the floor. As Fernández Noroña
  tries to exit the podium, another lawmaker enters the fray, taking a swing at
  the senate leader. “[Moreno] started to provoke me, to touch me, to pull at
  me,” Fernández Noroña said during a press conference after the incident. “He
  hit me on the arms and said: ‘I’m going to beat the shit out of you, I’m going
  to kill you.’” Moreno wrote on social media: “When Noroña crossed the line, he
  knew exactly what he was doing. I will always respond head-on, with character
  and without fear, to defend Mexico and give it the direction it deserves.” The
  scuffle followed a tense debate during which the governing Morena party and
  its allies accused the opposition Pri and Pan parties of calling for US
  military intervention in Mexico, a claim that both parties denied. Earlier
  this week, a senator from the Pan party had gone on Fox News and said that
  “help from the United States to fight the cartels in Mexico is absolutely
  welcome”. The issue has become particularly contentious in Mexico after Donald
  Trump reportedly authorized the use of military force targeting drug cartels
  deemed terrorist organizations in Latin American countries. The senate leader
  said he would call an emergency session on Friday and propose expelling Moreno
  and three other Pri lawmakers as a result of the scuffle. Fernández Noroña
  also posted on X that he had filed a criminal complaint against Moreno. In a
  statement on X, Moreno accused the governing party of changing the order of
  the day at the last minute in order to silence the opposition.
