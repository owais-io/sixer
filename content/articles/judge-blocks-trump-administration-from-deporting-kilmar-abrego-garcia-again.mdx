  A federal judge ruled on Wednesday morning that Kilmar Ábrego García cannot be
  deported until at least early October, according to CNN. The outlet also
  reported that US District Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the case,
  scheduled an evidentiary hearing for 6 October, and said that she intends to
  have Trump administration officials testify about the government’s efforts to
  re-deport Ábrego. At the same hearing, Ábrego’s lawyers informed the court
  that the 30-year-old plans to seek asylum in the United States, according to
  the Associated Press. Ábrego’s case has drawn national attention since he was
  wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March.
  Following widespread pressure, including from the supreme court, the Trump
  administration returned him to the US in June. However, upon his return, he
  immediately faced criminal charges related to human smuggling, allegations
  that his lawyers have rejected as “preposterous”. He was released from
  criminal custody in Tennessee on Friday, while awaiting trial. But over the
  weekend, the Trump administration announced new plans to deport him to Uganda.
  Then on Monday, Ábrego was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) during a scheduled immigration check-in in Baltimore, which
  was one of the conditions of his release. He is currently being held in a
  detention center in Virginia. Ábrego’s legal team swiftly filed a lawsuit on
  Monday, challenging both his current detention and his potential deportation
  to Uganda. In court filings, they argued that the government is retaliating
  against Ábrego for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. “The only
  reason he was taken into detention was to punish him” said Simon
  Sandoval-Moshenberg, an attorney representing Ábrego, on Monday. “To punish
  him for exercising his constitutional rights.” Later on Monday, Xinis issued a
  ruling, temporarily barring the government from deporting Ábrego until at
  least Friday. Ábrego entered the US without authorization around 2011 as a
  teenager. According to court documents, he was fleeing gang violence. In 2019,
  a federal court granted him protection from deportation to El Salvador. But
  despite that ruling, in March, he was mistakenly deported there by the Trump
  administration. In court documents in April, the Trump administration admitted
  that Ábrego’s deportation was an “administrative error”. But since then, Trump
  administration officials have repeatedly accused him of being affiliated with
  the MS-13 gang, a claim Ábrego and his family have denied.
