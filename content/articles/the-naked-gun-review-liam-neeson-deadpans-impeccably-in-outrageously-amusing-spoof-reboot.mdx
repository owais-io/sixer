  The Naked Gun review – Liam Neeson deadpans impeccably in outrageously amusing
  spoof reboot

  Here is Liam Neeson doing a rumbly-menacing voice even sillier than the one he
  did in Taken – and he now presumably must decide whether, like Leslie Nielsen
  before him, he will pivot to spoof comedy full-time. To be fair, Neeson has
  more career capital to lose than Nielsen did. He deadpans it impeccably, but
  perhaps doesn’t quite have Nielsen’s eerie innocence. In any case, it doesn’t
  stop this reboot of the Naked Gun franchise from being a lot of fun: amiably
  ridiculous, refreshingly shallow, entirely pointless and guilelessly crass. It
  is a life-support system for some outrageous gags, including sensational riffs
  on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sex and the City, and one showstopping
  are-they-really-gonna-do-it reference to OJ Simpson, who featured in the
  original films. David Zucker, co-creator of those and the Airplane! films, is
  reportedly dissatisfied with this new version from the team of director Akiva
  Schaffer and co-writers Dan Gregor and Doug Mand. A spoof of a spoof is always
  going to be a potential problem, but Schaffer et al canter entertainingly
  through their succession of absurdist scenarios – and at one stage contrive a
  classic Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker homage: a moment of mayhem followed by a
  wide-shot of people queueing up obediently for violence, like Airplane!’s line
  of (hitherto unseen) passengers. Neeson plays Det Lt Frank Drebin Jr, who is
  the son of the LA cop once played by Nielsen, and haunted in a rather Freudian
  way by his late father’s reputation. He is given to making yearning monologues
  addressed to Drebin Sr’s presence, begging him to send a sign “like an owl or
  something”. Paul Walter Hauser plays his stolid partner Capt Ed Hocken Jr, son
  of Drebin Sr’s partner who was once played by George Kennedy. The next-gen
  Drebin investigates the possible murder of a man found dead at the wheel of a
  hi-tech electric car, and must confront the sinister Muskalike plutocrat who
  invented this vehicle; this is Richard Cane, played by Danny Huston. Drebin
  then falls in love with the dead man’s sister Beth, a true-crime novelist
  played by Pamela Anderson. When Drebin first sees Beth, he has an ecstatic
  voiceover about what I can only describe as her person; it finishes with a
  quite extraordinarily bizarre and offensive tribute which caused the audience
  I was in to go into gibbering shock. The memory of this amusing line recurred
  like PTSD throughout the film’s running time. The new Naked Gun has the look
  and feel of an 80s LA action movie, with sense-memories of Beverly Hills Cop
  and Terminator. The first rush of Frank and Beth’s romance is represented by
  an uproariously extended winter-sports-themed pop video of the sort beloved by
  Wham! fans. There is no reason for this new Naked Gun to exist other than the
  reason for the old ones: it’s a laugh, disposable, forgettable, enjoyable. •
  The Naked Gun is out on 1 August in the UK and US, and on 21 August in
  Australia.
