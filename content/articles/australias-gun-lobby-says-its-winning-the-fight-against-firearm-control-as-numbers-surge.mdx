  The gun lobby claims it is “winning” the fight against Australia’s
  longstanding crackdown on firearms, pointing to a sharp increase in licensed
  gun owners and weapons since new laws were introduced in the aftermath of the
  1996 Port Arthur massacre as a sign of its strength. The claim, made in a June
  video address to members of the Shooters Union lobby group, comes as half a
  dozen Australian pro-gun groups band together for the first time to resist
  more national firearm restrictions. Australia’s gun laws are held up as the
  global gold standard for community safety, but almost 30 years since a
  national firearms agreement was introduced after Martin Bryant shot and killed
  35 people in Tasmania, experts say these laws must be galvanised. At the same
  time, the gun lobby is mobilising. In May, a group of national shooting bodies
  met in the Australian capital to discuss how best to respond to what they
  describe as a “growing attack” on firearm users, and the need for a unified
  position. The group met again in late July. Sign up: AU Breaking News email
  The lobby is alarmed especially by new firearms laws introduced in Western
  Australia, which have – among other measures – limited the number of guns that
  an individual licence holder can own. Figures show the number of legal guns in
  Australia is booming. According to a January report by thinktank The Australia
  Institute, there are more than 4m guns nationally, almost double the number
  recorded in the years after the Port Arthur massacre that prompted a national
  crackdown, according to a report commissioned by gun safety groups. Over the
  past five years, this number has been rising. Data obtained by Guardian
  Australia from state and territory firearm registers show that in this period,
  there has been a more than 10% increase in guns in Victoria and NSW, a 30%
  rise in Queensland and a 45% spike in the Northern Territory. There are at
  least 2,000 new guns lawfully entering the community every week. NSW firearm
  registry data shows that in Sydney there are more than 70 individuals who own
  more than 100 firearms, including one person who owns 385 guns. The register
  notes that this is not a collector or a dealer. Graham Park, the president of
  Shooters Union Australia, told supporters shooters need to resist a “defeatist
  attitude” in the face of attempts to restrict firearm ownership. He also
  outlined a strategy to double the number of licensed firearm holders in the
  country over the next few years to increase the gun lobby’s political power.
  “We’re actually winning, and when I say ‘we’, I mean you as firearm owners
  anywhere in Australia – you’re actually winning,” Park said in the 16 June
  member update. He described the national firearms agreement, devised by the
  Howard government and which was reached 12 days after the Port Arthur massacre
  on 28 April 1996, as the “wet dream of the anti-gunners”. “They thought what
  would happen is shooters would just fade away and that there would be maybe
  left a few farmers who needed guns for work and a few old blokes … shooting
  their single-shot target rifles at the range and that’s it.” But Park claimed
  the increase in ownership to more than 4m guns since the agreement was signed
  shows the push to restrict ownership has failed. “We’ve been winning because,
  every year since about ‘99 or 2000, the number of shooters in your state, and
  every other state, has grown and grown and grown.” Park said it was “not
  rocket science” that “criminals and crazy people” should be restricted from
  owning guns. “We [licensed gun owners] all want that. We want that more than
  anyone else,” he said. The union is urging licence holders to remain active
  even if they are no longer using firearms and is encouraging members to
  recruit others. “The more people with gun licences, the more political
  influence,” Park said. “Politicians are going to pay attention because
  politicians respect numbers, and the last thing they want to do is to irritate
  big blocks of people.” He said the existence of a strong gun community is “a
  victory against those who hate basic Australian traditional values and
  fairness”. In response to questions, Park told Guardian Australia the Shooters
  Union supports many aspects of the national firearms agreement, including
  licensing, secure storage and the requirement to have a “genuine reason” to
  own a gun. “As an organisation, we do not support people having an absolute
  right to own firearms for whatever reason they feel like,” he said. “And
  frankly, we are getting tired of extremist gun control activists pushing the
  false narrative that any changes – no matter how minor or sensible in favour
  of licensed shooters – to our gun laws will somehow turn the country in[to] a
  war zone or ‘make it like America’.” Park was one of the shooting group
  representatives who attended the May meeting in Canberra, which was convened
  by gun industry lobby group, the Shooting Industry Foundation of Australia
  (Sifa). The Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, Field &amp; Game
  Australia, International Practical Shooting Confederation Australia, Sporting
  Clays Australia, and the National Rifle Association of Australia also took
  part. “The purpose of the meeting was to explore how we can unify shooting
  organisations so that we can coordinate our efforts on key issues and
  strengthen our voice in advocating for all licensed firearms owners,
  businesses, and the broader shooting and hunting community,” a statement from
  Sifa said, describing their alliance as a “historic collaboration”. In July,
  the Australian Clay Target Association and the Australian Deer Association
  joined the group at its second meeting, where they all agreed to push for the
  reinstatement of a federal firearms advisory committee to advise government.
  The organisations are also pushing back against any move to restrict gun
  ownership as part of a new national firearms register that was agreed to by
  state and territory leaders in 2023. It is due to come into effect in 2028 and
  will allow data sharing and firearms tracing between jurisdictions. Sifa has
  opposed the move to implement the register, saying it is unnecessary, while
  Park said it was “an expensive and unworkable duplication of something that
  already exists at state level”. Two federal politicians are backing the
  formation of the more powerful and united gun lobby, with Nationals senator
  Bridget McKenzie and Labor MP and Olympic shooter Dan Repacholi encouraging
  shooting groups to become more politically active. Speaking at a newly created
  online national gun conference last year, attended by many of the same
  organisations, McKenzie said she was happy to see “one united conversation”
  with shooting groups. She also told people who attended the forum (convened by
  a group called Politics Reloaded) to help “normalise hunting and shooting and
  to normalise hunters and shooters in the eyes of the broader Australian
  public”. “There’s a militancy, there’s a political arm … that has to be
  employed, but the social licence to be militant, to be political, also has to
  come with a legitimacy, and that legitimacy in a democracy like ours comes
  from people accepting that you have a right and a privilege to do what we want
  to do,” she said. McKenzie welcomed the idea of shooting groups forming a
  “caucus” to lobby the government, saying this was more effective than having
  individual groups trying to get their message across. She said: “We are well
  resourced” – in apparent reference to the shooting industry – and said she
  believed it was “super possible” to form a stronger alliance. Speaking ahead
  of the WA state election, McKenzie also said that by activating supporters of
  shooting before the election, “there’s a lot of mischief you can make in that
  period of time”. Repacholi has also spoken with the Politics Reloaded group,
  advising them on what shooters can do to “engage and use the political
  process”, such as employing professional lobbyists. “We need to make sure we
  have got the right people in there [parliament] singing the right tune,” he
  said in a March 2024 podcast. Repacholi told the Guardian he supported a
  national firearm registry that was developed in consultation with industry.
  “I’ve always backed responsible firearm ownership for sport, farming and other
  legit reasons. Our gun laws are there for a reason, to keep people safe and
  they’ve worked well for decades. If the number of guns goes up, it’s got to be
  matched with strong checks and balances.” Tim Quinn, president of Gun Control
  Australia, says it is “extremely easy” to obtain a firearm in Australia and
  warns against complacency because the number of guns in Australia is “getting
  bigger, faster”. “We are obviously very proud of our gun laws, but there are
  so many loose processes that we can fix,” Quinn told Guardian Australia.
  “People don’t know the nuance of that, and they don’t know the individual law
  – what they do know is they don’t want a society that has got more guns in it,
  and the number of guns is going up, and it is going up at an alarming rate,”
  he says. Quinn says he is concerned about the growing strength of the gun
  lobby and its new alliance. The national convener of the Australian Gun Safety
  Alliance, Stephen Bendle, says the WA legislation “has scared the pants off
  [the gun lobby]”, but he says the reforms are reasonable and should be adopted
  nationally. “The owning and possession of a firearm is a privilege conditional
  on the matter of public safety – that is written into every firearm act in the
  country – and I think the firearm industry has forgotten that,” he says.
  “[They] think it is a right to be able to own 385 firearms.” “The community
  doesn’t expect that there is open slather on getting as many legal guns as you
  can and having them stored [in homes] in suburban streets.” WA police
  commander Lawrence Panaia says he hopes other states will see the state’s
  reforms as a “beacon” that has public safety as a guiding principle, and
  follow suit. But he says the “politics is going to be difficult”. “You have a
  professional gun lobby that continually tries to disrupt the process,” he
  says. “They will fight it on every single front. Everything you do will be
  questioned.” He says it “beggars belief” that someone in NSW can claim a
  genuine reason for having almost 400 guns. “The real question here is … what
  genuine need or reason could there be to have 400 firearms? What could it
  possibly be?”
