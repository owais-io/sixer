  The new chief executive of Lloyd’s has stressed the insurance market’s
  “apolitical” stance in an apparent shift on climate policy, even as he warned
  of growing threats from an acceleration of extreme weather events. Patrick
  Tiernan, who took over as CEO from John Neal in June, said the corporation
  would no longer discourage insurers operating in the market from underwriting
  coal and other fossil fuel projects. In comments to the Financial Times, he
  said Lloyd’s planned to give its insurers more freedom, adding that “we
  respect the laws of the land” in the countries where they operate and the
  corporation defers to “the energy mix that the government of [a] jurisdiction
  chooses”. In a statement on the Lloyd’s website, Tiernan said: “We must remain
  apolitical. Our neutrality is part of our value. In a world of strained trade
  relations, Lloyd’s licence network can be a safe harbour.” As well as
  announcing sweeping trade tariffs, Donald Trump has been expanding oil, gas
  and coal production, ordering companies to “drill, baby, drill” while ditching
  green energy programmes. Through his trade deals, he is seeking to impose the
  US energy shift on other countries, forcing the EU to buy more oil and gas
  from the US. In recent years, Lloyd’s warned of an increase in the frequency
  and severity of climate change-related weather disasters, ranging from the
  devastating California wildfires to huge floods in Texas this year. The
  corporation started divesting from coal in 2018. Tiernan’s predecessor Neal
  was criticised for being slow to act but in a lengthy report in 2020, Lloyd’s
  pledged to “start to phase out insurance cover for, and investments in,
  thermal coal-fired power plants, thermal coalmines, oil sands, or new Arctic
  energy exploration activities”. It stated that from 1 January 2022, Lloyd’s
  managing agents, who act on behalf of insurers, would be “asked to no longer
  provide new insurance coverage or investments in these activities”. However,
  Lloyd’s stopped short of mandating divestment to its insurance members, saying
  it was up to companies to set their own strategy. While Tiernan’s position
  seems to mark a clear shift, a Lloyd’s spokesperson denied the market had
  changed its policy on underwriting energy. “Our aim is to support whatever
  energy mix individual governments determine is in their jurisdiction’s best
  interests while enabling managing agents to operate at the vanguard of new
  energy technologies,” they said. “For the market to run efficiently we must
  allow participants to make their decisions independently.” Tiernan said the
  world faced the same threats, namely major natural disasters, economic shocks
  and geopolitical instability. “What’s changing is the tempo – driven by new
  dynamics including climate change risk, the advent of AI, increasing social
  unrest and outsized liability awards, or ‘nuclear verdicts’,” he said. “Add to
  that a web of interconnected risks – cyber, supply chains, capital flows – and
  crises no longer ripple, they ricochet. Losses don’t sting, they hurt.
  Insurers must prepare for chain reactions, not just isolated events.” Lloyd’s
  reported a drop in half-year pre-tax profits to £4.2bn, from £4.9bn a year
  earlier. Gross written premiums rose to £32.5bn, from £30.6bn, while
  investment returns climbed to £3.2bn, from £2.1bn.
