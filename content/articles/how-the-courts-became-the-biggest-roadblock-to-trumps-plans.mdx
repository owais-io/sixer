  A federal judge’s ruling last week to maintain a sweeping nationwide ban on
  Donald Trump’s birthright citizenship order highlights the dizzying legal
  battle that has defined the administration’s opening months, with courts
  issuing dozens of such sweeping orders to systematically halt abrasive
  elements of the president’s agenda. US district judge Leo Sorokin in Boston
  rejected Trump administration arguments to narrow his nationwide injunction, a
  court order that prohibits the federal government from enforcing a law or
  policy against anyone across the nation, and not just the people who filed the
  legal challenge. His decision represents just one case in a broader pattern of
  judicial resistance to Trump administration actions. Courts have issued an
  estimated 35 nationwide injunctions against various Trump executive orders and
  policy changes from his inauguration until the supreme court intervened on 27
  June, according to a Guardian analysis of court records and Congressional
  Research Service data. There’s no standard legal definition for a nationwide
  injunction, so it is not possible to provide a single definitive count, but
  the roughly 35 orders during Trump’s second term have halted a broad range of
  policies, from the president’s attempt to end birthright citizenship to
  restrictions on federal funding for diversity programs and changes to refugee
  resettlement. In June, the supreme court significantly limited courts’ ability
  to issue nationwide injunctions, which fundamentally reshaped how opponents
  can challenge executive overreach and dismantled what some legal experts
  viewed as the most potent weapon against sweeping presidential policies.
  Without nationwide injunctions, challengers largely have to now pursue slower
  class-action lawsuits or file multiple suits across jurisdictions to achieve
  the same blocking effect, although the supreme court left the possibility for
  exceptions in some cases like Sorokin’s ruling, which found that nationwide
  relief was necessary to protect Americans from harm. “President Trump’s
  illegal abuses of power have created widespread harm for Americans across the
  country including farmers, students, working families and retirees that
  demanded a national response,” said Donald Sherman, deputy director of
  Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “The supreme court’s
  decision has certainly made it more complex to challenge President Trump’s
  lawless executive actions and put an unnecessary strain on judicial resources,
  but legal advocates and concerned citizens will not be deterred from holding
  the administration accountable in court.” During Trump’s first presidency,
  federal courts issued at least 64 nationwide injunctions against his
  administration, compared with 12 under Barack Obama’s eight-year presidency
  and just six under George W Bush’s two terms. The White House has praised the
  supreme court’s June order, saying “low-level activist judges have been
  exploiting their positions” to deliberately cut down Trump’s policy agenda.
  Those injunctions were issued by courts in mostly Democratic-leaning states
  and jurisdictions, including Washington DC, California, Rhode Island,
  Maryland, Texas, Massachusetts, New York and others, according to a Guardian
  analysis. Harvard Law Review research from Trump’s first term found that 92.2%
  of nationwide injunctions came from Democratic-appointed judges, while 100% of
  similar injunctions against Biden came from Republican-appointed judges. The
  Guardian analysis of the 35 nationwide injunctions issued during the first six
  months of the Trump administration demonstrates the types of policies that had
  been blocked by courts using this tool. Immigration enforcement and
  citizenship changes have prompted at least eight major nationwide injunctions,
  including in the landmark birthright citizenship case, cases targeting refugee
  program defunding and deportation accelerations. Federal funding policies have
  generated a wave of litigation, with at least six injunctions stopping various
  funding freezes and restrictions, stemming from suits filed by groups
  including the National Council of Nonprofits targeting funding freezes, and on
  targeting National Institutes of Health grants by the Association of American
  Medical Colleges. Policies on diversity, equity and inclusion and civil rights
  face numerous legal challenges and have resulted in nationwide injunctions in
  at least five cases, including a suit by the National Association of Diversity
  Officers fighting restrictions under Trump’s executive orders. At least two
  cases stemming from military service requirements stopped by nationwide
  injunctions fall into the same category, while federal agency restructuring
  has prompted suits from multiple state governments and federal employee unions
  and ended with nationwide injunctions. Some injunctions focused on executive
  overreach and legal targeting, while additional injunctions stopped emergency
  tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and restrictions
  on law firms that previously opposed Trump policies. “Since the moment
  President Trump took office, low-level activist judges have been exploiting
  their positions to kneecap the agenda on which he was overwhelmingly elected,”
  the White House said in a statement after the supreme court’s ruling in June.
  “In fact, of the 40 nationwide injunctions filed against President Trump’s
  executive actions in his second term, 35 of them came from just five far-left
  jurisdictions: California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Washington, and the
  District of Columbia.” The Guardian has not been able to identify 40
  nationwide injunctions independently. The White House and the Department of
  Justice have not responded to requests for comment on which injunctions they
  have on their list. The justice department has reportedly faced difficulties
  defending the volume of Trump’s executive orders, with lawyers struggling to
  answer judicial questions and correct the record in court, prompting the
  justice department to seek rapid transfers of attorneys to the division
  handling Trump policy defenses. The administration is also believed to be
  testing traditional presidential deference, the longstanding practice where
  courts generally defer to executive authority for national security and
  foreign affairs as it defends aggressive immigration, trade and economic
  policies, while taking the unprecedented step of suing federal judges who
  issue blocking orders. Legal challenges have also targeted more specific
  policies, prompting nationwide injunctions in cases targeting restrictions on
  gender-affirming care in federal prisons, changes to passport gender markers
  and federal employment terminations affecting thousands of workers. Following
  the supreme court decision in Trump v Casa in June, courts are now prohibited
  from issuing nationwide injunctions against presidential policies. But there
  is an exception, which comes when a judge decides it is the only way to fully
  protect the people bringing the lawsuit, like in the case of the birthright
  citizenship challenge. The White House said: “Now, the Trump Administration
  can promptly proceed with critical action to save the country – like ending
  birthright citizenship, ceasing sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee
  resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping taxpayers from funding
  transgender surgeries, and much more.” But some legal experts aren’t so sure
  on the long-term impact of the supreme court’s restrictions on nationwide
  injunctions just yet. “I think it remains to be seen how the practical
  consequences of the supreme court’s decision shake out,” said Barbara McQuade,
  a University of Michigan law professor and former Obama-appointed US attorney.
  “Several of the justices suggested that class actions would provide a
  mechanism to block lawless executive orders and prevent irreparable harm, but,
  of course, class actions can be cumbersome and slower than a simple temporary
  restraining order. “We will need to see how lower courts address the supreme
  court’s exception where necessary,” McQuade said. For those in the crosshairs
  of Trump’s policies – like undocumented immigrants facing deportation and
  non-profits losing federal funding – the harm could be measured in weeks or
  months. The supreme court’s decision hasn’t eliminated legal challenges to
  presidential power, but it has fundamentally altered their speed and scope.
