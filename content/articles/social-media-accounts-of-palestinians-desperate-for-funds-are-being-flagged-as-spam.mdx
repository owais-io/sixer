  Hanin Al-Batsh estimates she has signed up for more than 80 Bluesky accounts
  in the last six months. Like hundreds of other Palestinians struggling to buy
  or even find food in Gaza, Al-Batsh uses Bluesky to promote her crowdfunding
  campaigns, hoping to raise enough money for flour and milk for her children in
  a given week. Her posts on the text-based social network have grown
  increasingly desperate as Israel tightens its grip of the Gaza Strip, forcing
  millions into starvation. “Hello friends, my children have become weak, have
  lost weight, are malnourished, and have very low iron levels,” Al-Batsh’s
  latest post reads. Images the young mother shared with the Guardian show her
  two sons, one-and-a-half-year-old Ahmed and three-year-old Adam, sprawled out
  on a makeshift bed on the floor of the warehouse where they are sheltering. As
  hunger is spreading rapidly through Gaza, and aid remains inaccessible to
  many, Palestinians are turning to crowdsourcing campaigns hosted on sites like
  GoFundMe and Chuffled as a lifeline. But as they seek to get the word about
  their campaigns out in the world via social media, their accounts are
  frequently shut down or marked as spam. That’s especially the case on Bluesky,
  the young Twitter alternative popular in Gaza. Bluesky has deactivated nearly
  all of Al-Batsh’s accounts after just a few days, she said. The longest she
  has been able to hold on to one is 12 days. When the social network marks one
  account as spam, she creates another one, hoping to reassure potential donors
  that she is not a bot. The shutdowns, therefore, ironically force her to
  resort to exactly the behavior that Bluesky, in its effort to combat bots and
  scams, is seeking to root out: batch following and then repeatedly tagging the
  same people who engaged with their previous accounts. Al-Batsh no longer tags
  people in every post after a stern email from Bluesky, hoping to abide by the
  platform’s rules. “But now no one can find my posts,” she said. In other
  words, in an act of desperation, these Palestinians often do operate like
  bots. With every fresh account, it becomes harder for people like Al-Batsh to
  shake the accusation. Low follower counts and posts that repeatedly tag others
  en masse are often tell-tale signs of a bot. Recently, though, a grassroots
  answer to the problem has emerged. Since May, new Bluesky accounts Al-Batsh
  has made have something new: all her posts end with a green checkmark emoji
  and the phrase: “Verified by Molly Shah,” a reference to a Germany-based
  lawyer-turned-activist who has been independently verifying Gaza crowdfunding
  campaigns. There are a handful of other volunteers doing the same work on
  Bluesky. And similar efforts exist on other social media platforms. Some are
  even run by entire teams of volunteers: there’s GazaFunds and Radio Watermelon
  on X and Instagram, and Gaza Vetters on Tumblr. Still, Shah said, she wished
  there was a better system in place. “This centers me too much,” she said. A
  guerrilla verification network Shah has been on Bluesky since the early days
  of the relatively young platform’s life, when she had only about 7,000
  followers and knew of only one or two people from Gaza with a Bluesky account,
  including one person named Jamal. That’s how her verification project started:
  she had encouraged Jamal, a friend of a friend, to open a Bluesky account and
  shared his posts on her own profile, hoping to bring attention to his
  crowdfunding campaign in early 2024. It worked. Jamal raised $10,000. Shah’s
  verification project snowballed as more people in Gaza joined the social
  network. Many reached out to her, hoping she’d share their campaigns with her
  now 57,000 followers. She began asking for information about the individuals
  or families in the campaigns before sharing them, and that’s how her guerrilla
  authentication network got its start. Today, Shah has a spreadsheet of more
  than 300 accounts she’s vetted and verified. They use the same badge of
  authentication as Al-Batsh, “verified by Molly Shah”, in their posts and
  profile pages. The stamp doesn’t always prevent a Bluesky account from being
  flagged as spam by the company’s systems, but her hope is that it will help
  other people on Bluesky confirm that the person behind the account is genuine.
  “The verification seems to help people recognize that they’re real people,”
  Shah said. “I just want people to get to know Palestinians. To me, I don’t
  think of it as fundraising as the main goal, though I’m happy to help them do
  that. I think of it as [combatting] the persistent and insistent
  dehumanization of Palestinians.” The vetting process isn’t standard, Shah
  said, and can include doing a video call, having someone Shah has already
  vetted or knows personally to vouch or viewing documentation that proves their
  identity and shows that they’re still in Gaza. All of this takes time.
  Al-Batsh said she waited two months before she heard back from Shah.
  Occasionally, Shah will come across a person pretending to be in Gaza or
  misrepresenting their situation in other ways. For the most part, the people
  who reach out to her are in fact real people in Gaza in need of help. Stopping
  devastating scams Gaza has reached catastrophic levels of famine, according to
  aid and human rights organizations, which raises the stakes of each
  fundraising campaign and even each post on Bluesky. Duaa Al-Madhoun, another
  mother in Gaza trying to feed her three children, said she, too, has had
  dozens of her Bluesky accounts deleted. Buying flour, milk and diapers cost
  her $100 a day when those items are available. Lately, diapers and milk have
  been harder to find, she said, and she’ll go some days without eating so that
  she can feed her children. “My child wears nylon bags, no diapers. He suffers
  from diaper rash,” Al-Madhoun said. “Food is scarce and very expensive. If
  food is available, I just eat some rice.” The impact of a fundraiser can be
  near immediate, according to Nat Calhoun, who aids several families in Gaza
  with their campaigns. In one case, Calhoun said, a family they are in touch
  with in Mawasi, Khan Younis, reached out to them about an older woman in their
  town who had not eaten for several days. They were able to raise $110 to buy
  her flour and transferred the money to her the next day. “It can be
  instantaneous,” Calhoun said. “I don’t think people realize that your help can
  make an impact in a day.” To receive the money collected through fundraisers,
  Palestinians need to work with a “receiver”, someone outside of Gaza who sets
  up the campaign and collects the money on their behalf and wires the money
  through their banks. That’s because the platforms use payment processors that
  do not operate in Gaza. The system has meant that Palestinians have been
  required to place a great deal of trust in these middle actors, who are people
  they’ve never met. It also means the campaigns, and the Palestinians relying
  on them, are vulnerable to scams. Calhoun and Shah say many of the scams they
  do see exploit and victimize Palestinians. Al-Batsh’s first campaign was
  hosted on GoFundMe by a woman who listed her location as Tucson, Arizona. The
  campaign raised nearly $37,000. Al-Batsh received about $34,000 before the
  campaign host told Al-Batsh that she had trouble logging into the campaign. “I
  never received the rest of the money,” Al-Batsh said. “It breaks my brain to
  think about,” Calhoun said. “It’s frustrating because the people in Gaza can’t
  make their own fundraisers. They’re at the whims of somebody else and they
  have to trust somebody to do good by them.” Requesting changes from Bluesky A
  spam label on Bluesky is enough to deter donations. Ad hoc verification
  systems like Shah’s provide some level of guarantee that the money people are
  donating will actually help someone in Gaza rather than a bot farm or scammer.
  When Shah shares a campaign, it makes a difference. Al-Batsh’s campaign has
  received 10 donations ranging from $5 to $505 in the two days since Shah
  shared her post. Before that, she was averaging two to three donations a day,
  if that. Though her verification network has helped some Palestinians maintain
  their online lifelines, Shah says it’s not a sustainable system. She is
  overwhelmed with requests and had to decide to share only one account a day.
  In the meantime, thousands of Bluesky users have signed open letters and made
  public pleas asking the company to improve its moderation practices. “We
  understand that some Gazans post in a way that may trigger some of Bluesky’s
  internal automated spam rules when posting fundraising links,” one of the open
  letters, with 7,000 signatures, reads. “However, treating a group of extremely
  vulnerable people the same way that the platform treats t-shirt bots and
  phishers is not only incredibly cruel, it has also exacerbated the situation
  of desperate people just attempting to survive.” Bluesky said in response to
  the open letter that the company was “committed to ensuring” people in Gaza
  “can be heard” on the platform. However, it continued, some of the behaviors
  of these accounts violated community guidelines, and it encouraged users to
  “focus their efforts through authentic accounts”. Bluesky did not respond to a
  request for comment. “We can’t get every moderation decision right, which is
  why we maintain an appeals process,” the post continued. Shah and others
  connected with people in Gaza say few people get a response from the company
  when they file an appeal. It remains difficult for Palestinians to maintain
  their accounts for more than a few days. Bluesky had an opportunity to improve
  its moderation system in the early days of the war in Gaza, when there were
  fewer people on the platform, Shah said. She wishes they had taken it. “It
  sounds like Bluesky is saying: ‘We’re getting rid of spammers,’ but really
  what they’re getting rid of are people who are desperate,” she said.
