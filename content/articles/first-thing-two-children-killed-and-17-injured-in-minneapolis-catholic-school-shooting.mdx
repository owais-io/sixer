  Good morning. Two children were killed and 17 people wounded in a mass
  shooting on Wednesday at a Catholic school in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A
  shooter at the Annunciation Catholic school in south Minneapolis killed two
  children aged eight and 10 in church pews during morning mass. Fourteen more
  children aged between six and 15 were injured, two of them critically, but
  officials said they were expected to survive. The three injured adults were
  parishioners in their 80s, officials said. The shooter died by suicide. The
  attack took place just before 8.30am during a service marking the first week
  of school. The shooter, who was identified as Robin Westman, 23, fired a rifle
  into the windows towards the children sitting in the pews. What have the
  authorities said about motivations? The FBI said it was investigating the
  shooting as “an act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics”.
  Did the shooter obtain their weapon legally? Yes, Westman had lawfully bought
  a rifle, a shotgun and a pistol recently. CDC plunged into chaos after ousted
  chief refuses to resign The Trump administration is attempting to oust the
  director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Susan
  Monarez, but her lawyers said she would not resign and she was being
  “targeted” for being pro-science. Monarez, who was sworn in less than a month
  ago, was pushed out on Wednesday evening, according to a statement posted on
  social media by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that offered
  no explanation for its decision. Her lawyers said she had “neither resigned
  nor received notification” from the White House of her termination. It appears
  the administration is trying to drive Monarez out over a conflict with the
  health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, after she refused to back changes to US
  vaccine policies, the Washington Post and the New York Times reported. What
  has the reaction been? The HHS announcement triggered at least three other CDC
  leaders to publicly resign. Trump serious about pursuing a third term, Gavin
  Newsom warns Donald Trump is serious about running for a third term in breach
  of the US constitution, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, has said as he
  warned again that the president could try to cling to power. Speaking during a
  live interview at a summit in Sacramento, Newsom said Americans needed to wake
  up to Trump’s disregard for democratic processes. “I don’t think Donald Trump
  wants another election,” he said. “This guy doesn’t believe in free, fair
  elections.” Newsom said that during an Oval Office meeting with the president
  in February, Trump had raised the subject after pointing to a portrait of
  Franklin D Roosevelt, the only US president to serve more than two terms. “I
  said: ‘I know exactly what you mean.’ And then he went on and on about the
  third term.” What has Trump said recently about 2028? Asked earlier this month
  if he would run again, Trump said: “No, probably not,” before adding: “I’d
  like to run. I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.” In other news … A
  wave of Russian airstrikes on Kyiv have killed at least 14 people and injured
  dozens in the deadliest attack on the Ukrainian capital in several weeks. The
  UK, France and Germany are expected to reintroduce extensive sanctions against
  Iran after it refused to allow UN inspectors into all of its nuclear sites.
  Argentina’s far-right president, Javier Milei, had rocks and bottles thrown at
  him by demonstrators protesting about a corruption scandal. A Democratic
  candidate has defeated a Maga Republican in a state senate election in Iowa,
  claiming that voters are “waking up” to realize Donald Trump’s party’s
  policies are not working for them. Stat of the day: TB drugs running out in
  Malawi, where 47% of cases are co-infected with HIV Malawi’s stocks of
  tuberculosis medicines will run out by the end of September, health officials
  have warned. In the south-east African country, which has been badly affected
  by the recent aid cuts from the US, UK and other donors, 47% of TB cases are
  co-infected with HIV, according to the US CDC. The lack of medicine threatens
  to undo the progress made over the last decade, in which Malawi reduced TB
  cases by 40%. Don’t miss this: What has the Netflix algorithm done to our
  films? Netflix is churning out “algorithm movies” – films designed to appeal
  to such broad swathes of viewers that the result is bland and forgettable. In
  fact, they explicitly aim to feature obvious moments of exposition for the
  half-attentive viewer, to help those who are watching the films “in the
  background”. Phil Hoad looks at how we got here – and the effect generative AI
  could have on films and viewers. Climate check: How coastal development and
  the climate crisis are affecting southern Malaysia’s sea people The Orang
  Seletar community, one of Malaysia’s Indigenous communities along the coast of
  the southern state of Johor, rely on fishing. But as property development
  destroys the mangroves they fish in and the climate heats the waters, their
  catch is dwindling. Here is how some from the seafaring communities are
  adapting. Last Thing: Would you pay $25 for a bottle of water? Meet the water
  sommeliers When you go to a restaurant, how often do you think about what the
  water tastes like? Water sommeliers (yes, you read that right) want to change
  that, with more than a dozen restaurants in the US now offering a water menu.
  Simon Usborne heads to a restaurant in England that has a water sommelier at
  hand to explain the distinct taste notes offered by each choice – with one
  bottle costing as much as £19 ($25). Sign up First Thing is delivered to
