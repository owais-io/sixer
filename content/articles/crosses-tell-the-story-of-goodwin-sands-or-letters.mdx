  Re your report (‘Running riot through graves’: King Charles urged to protect
  Goodwin Sands from dredging, 18 August), in 1847 the German poet and novelist
  Theodor Fontane wrote the poem Goodwin-Sand, whose last lines translate as:
  “Mast-spikes stick up here and there / And where they surface in the gloom /
  They are crosses over the tomb. / This is a churchyard, half sea, half land, /
  These are the shoals of the Goodwin Sands.” When I was a child at least two of
  those crosses still existed on the Sands. Now that they are gone, we need
  reminding that a huge graveyard with countless bodies from more than 2,000
  wrecks lies a few miles off the coast at Deal. Dr Diana Hirst Rye, East Sussex
  • Apart from being unimpressed by the crown estate’s pettifogging statement, I
  was astonished to find that the estate owns virtually all our seabeds, to a
  distance of 12 nautical miles, not to mention managing the rights for the UK’s
  continental shelf. It’s high time King Charles took a little direct action.
