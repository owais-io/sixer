  The siblings of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent
  accusers who died earlier this year, said their sister had wanted the
  so-called Epstein files to be released, and urged Donald Trump not to pardon
  his longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. In an interview with NBC News on
  Thursday, Giuffre’s family said she would have wanted the documents – a trove
  of materials related to the investigation into the years of abuse into the
  late sex offender – made public. “She had a little bit of hope in her because
  it was said that the files were going to be released,” Amanda Roberts,
  Giuffre’s sister-in-law, told the network in an interview, saying Giuffre
  would have wanted “transparency and justice” for his victims. “She was
  fighting for that to happen right up until the very end,” Roberts added. “She
  wanted the public to know the crimes that they had committed.” Earlier this
  week, Trump said Epstein, with whom he socialized for more than a decade,
  “stole” Giuffre and other young female staffers from his Mar-a-Lago country
  club, where she worked as a spa attendant in 2000. Trump made the remark to
  reporters after he was asked to elaborate on an earlier comment in which he
  said he had kicked Epstein out of his club “because he [Epstein] did something
  that was inappropriate” – specifically, that “he stole people that worked for
  me”. “She’s not an object, she’s a person,” Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s other
  brother, said through tears. “She’s a mom. She’s a sister. And she was
  recruited by Maxwell. She wasn’t stolen.” He said the family was “shocked” to
  hear Trump use the word “stolen” to describe what had happened to his sister,
  who said in a lawsuit that she was hired away from the Mar-a-Lago spa by
  Maxwell when she was 16. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt,
  noted the president was responding to a reporter’s question and did not bring
  up Giuffre himself. “The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey
  Epstein out of his club for being a creep to his female employees,” Leavitt
  said. Giuffre, who died this year, alleged in her complaint that she was first
  abused by Epstein and Maxwell together, and then “lent out to other powerful
  men”, including Prince Andrew. Andrew has denied wrongdoing. Maxwell, who is
  serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role recruiting and trafficking
  minors for sex, has asked the US supreme court to overturn her conviction and
  is reportedly seeking a pardon from the president. A Trump administration
  official said the president was not currently considering clemency action for
  Maxwell. The Associated Press contributed reporting
