  My brother, Matthew Law, who has died aged 63, was for more than 20 years a
  beloved tutor at the Boat Building Academy, the “wooden boat school”, in Lyme
  Regis, Dorset. The academy’s motto, “Launching People (and Boats)”, perfectly
  encapsulated Matthew’s own motivation. Thirty years sober at the time of his
  death, he tirelessly supported others struggling with addiction. He was an
  exceptional mentor: funny, original, gentle and passionate. Born in Dorking,
  Surrey, Matt was the second son of Tim, a headteacher who loved sailing, and
  Anne, who had worked as part of the Student Movement House organisation in
  Kenya, Tanzania and Burma. Growing up in Bude, Cornwall, meant playing in the
  sea and on the downs. Our family moved with my father’s job to Hertfordshire,
  and Matt attended Cavendish school in Hemel Hempstead. Work experience as a
  thatcher and a summer job on tugs in Southampton harbour showed his affinity
  for craft and boats. He got a scholarship to Gordonstoun school in Scotland
  for his sixth form. After a year studying humanities at Middlesex Polytechnic,
  he returned to the family home, by now in Wareham, Dorset, and worked for the
  RNLI as a labourer and in their research department in Poole. In the early 80s
  Matthew joined the Tate Gallery in London as a technician, combining his love
  of art with his forklift driving skills. From there, he joined a year-long EU
  youth expedition, driving a convoy of 4x4s from London to Cape Town, engaging
  in projects along the way. After jobs in London as a management consultant,
  then a researcher for a Confederation of British Industry film project, in
  1989 Matthew joined the Irish aid agency Goal, driven by a desire to return to
  Africa to work in relief and development. He managed their Khartoum office for
  a year, and in 1990 he helped establish Action Africa in Need in Nairobi,
  setting up a new aid route into war-torn South Sudan. This led to him
  overseeing the south-east region of Kenya for Unicef, establishing refugee
  camps and aid routes for the thousands fleeing conflict in Somalia. In 1995 he
  embarked on a master’s in development studies at Trinity College Dublin, where
  he got sober and a distinction. After a stint at Save the Children in London
  he made another change. He undertook a year of training in 1999 at the wooden
  boat school and was apprenticed at Latham’s boatyard in Poole, then returned
  to the school as a tutor, quickly assuming substantial responsibility for its
  operation. One of his colleagues in Lyme Regis described the “many hours we
  spent in fits of giggles, trying to pull ourselves together to look more
  professional. I think it was all this laughter that made him such a hit with
  the students.” He was a wonderful teacher, hugely knowledgable, with a genuine
  interest in those around him; and an enthusiast for, among other things, dogs,
  fun, his family, calligraphy, friends, exuberant rearrangements of the English
  language, and chocolate eggs. He is survived by me, and by his niece, Eliza
  and nephew, Seamus.
