  Ursula von der Leyen’s Turnberry golf course deal has been rightly called a
  capitulation and a humiliation for Europe. Assuming such an accord would put
  an end to Donald Trump’s coercion and bullying was either naive or the result
  of a miserable delusion. The EU should now steel itself and reject the terms
  imposed by Trump. Is this deal really as bad as it sounds? Unfortunately, it
  is, for at least three reasons. The blow to Europe’s international credibility
  is incalculable in a world that expects the EU to stand up for reciprocity and
  rules-based trade, to resist Washington’s coercion as Canada, China and Brazil
  have, rather than condoning it. Economically, it’s a damaging one-way street:
  EU exporters lose market access in the US while the EU market is hit by more
  favoured US competition. Core European industrial sectors such as pharma and
  steel and aluminium are left by the wayside. The balance also tilts in the
  US’s favour in important sectors such as consumer goods, food and drink, and
  agriculture. Tariffs tend to stick, so this is long-term damage. The EU even
  gives up its right to respond to future US pressures through duties on digital
  services or network fees. To top it off, von der Leyen’s defence and
  investment pledges (for which she had no mandate) go against Europe’s
  interest. The EU’s competitiveness predicament is precisely one of net
  investment outflows. As international capital now reallocates under the
  pressures of Trumponomics and a weakening dollar, the case for Europe to
  become a strategic investment power was strengthening. Von der Leyen’s promise
  of $600bn in EU investment in the US is therefore disastrous messaging. How
  could this happen? All EU member states wanted to avoid Trump’s 30% tariff
  threat and a trade war, but none perhaps as much as Germany and Ireland,
  supported by German carmakers and US big tech firms. Yet Irish sweetheart
  digital tax deals, as well as BMW and Mercedes’s plans to move production hubs
  to the US (also to serve the EU market), cannot be Europe’s future. EU
  governments were distinctly unhelpful in building the EU’s negotiating
  position. But in the end, it was von der Leyen who blinked and she has to take
  responsibility. Her close team took control in the closing weeks and went into
  the final meeting manifestly prepared only to say yes, which made Trump’s
  steamrolling inevitable. Let’s think of the counterfactual: if von der Leyen
  had stepped into the room and rejected these terms, Trump’s wrath and some
  market turmoil may have ensued. But ultimately it would very likely have come
  to a postponement, a new negotiation and, at some point, a different deal that
  would not be so lopsided or unilaterally trade away deep and long-term
  European interests and principles. Instead, von der Leyen became a supplicant
  to a triumphant Trump. The situation is reminiscent of the final rounds of the
  Brexit negotiations five years ago when von der Leyen similarly was giving in
  to unacceptable demands from Boris Johnson, only to U-turn under pressure from
  a steelier EU chief negotiator and a quartet of member states. Today, von der
  Leyen runs Brussels with a strong presidential hand and has largely done away
  with internal checks and balances inside the commission. That is her
  prerogative and her style, but the upshot should not be weak, ineffective and
  unprincipled dealings on Europe’s major geopolitical challenges, from Trump to
  Gaza. The “deal” in Scotland is in reality an unstable interim accord. Nothing
  is yet inked or signed; Washington and Brussels are already locking horns on
  its interpretation and negotiations on the finer (and broader) points are
  ongoing. The 27 EU governments will inevitably get involved as the final deal
  needs to be translated into an international agreement and EU law. Some big
  powers – Germany and Italy seemingly – are on board, reluctant or not.
  However, internal political dynamics may change their calculations. Opposition
  parties and rightwing contenders who are a real political threat to leaders in
  Germany and France are already lambasting the deal. Unless von der Leyen
  strikes a dirty bargain with the member states, the European parliament will
  also have a say. The longtime chair of its trade committee, Bernd Lange, has
  set the tone for how the deal would be viewed there, calling it “asymmetry set
  in stone” and even “a misery”. As details seep out on what von der Leyen has
  really agreed to and what the US expects from the EU, and all the consequences
  become clear, an already unpalatable deal may become even more so. Weakening
  US economic data and returning stock market jitters show that Trump’s
  negotiation footing is fragile. His new tariff threats come with new
  extensions, up to 90 days in the case of Mexico, as his position is
  overstretched. For Europe, the lesson from the Brexit negotiations – one that
  von der Leyen ought to have grasped before now – is that nothing is agreed
  until everything is agreed. There is now an opportunity for EU governments and
  the European parliament to course correct and salvage something from this
  train wreck. Georg Riekeles is a former EU official who served on the
  Commission’s task force for the Brexit negotiations. He is an associate
  director of the European Policy Centre think tank. Varg Folkman is a policy
  analyst at the European Policy Centre.
