  Multiple wildfires have ignited across California as the state continues to
  scorch in a multi-day heatwave that is expected to last through the weekend.
  The largest this week, named the Pickett fire, exploded in size on Thursday as
  it burned in a remote area of Napa county, and covered more than 3,200 acres
  (850 hectares) by Friday afternoon. Evacuation orders and warnings have been
  issued on Thursday for hundreds of residents around Calistoga, a small city in
  the region known for its wine, as firefighters faced challenging conditions,
  working through dangerously high temperatures and rugged terrain. The fire’s
  perimeter is just 5% contained. “Firefighter safety will be an emphasis once
  again Friday, with temperatures expected to reach into the upper 90s,”
  analysts with the state fire agency known as CalFire wrote in an update issued
  on Friday. Bob Todeschini, the battalion chief on the Pickett fire, said there
  had been no injuries or structures damaged, in a video shared on social media
  on Thursday night. “We’d like to remind everyone to be vigilant and have a
  plan as we continue with suppression efforts,” he said. The fresh wildfires
  come as California is experiencing its worst multi-day heatwave of the year,
  with some cities already breaking daily temperature records. Fire risks remain
  exceptionally high across the American west with high temperatures expected to
  linger for days. “Hot, dry, and unstable conditions are likely along much of
  the West Coast near and west of the Cascades and Sierra as near record-setting
  temperatures 10-25F above normal are expected,” according to an analysis from
  the National Interagency Fire Center issued on Friday. Paired with low
  humidity and a chance of dry thunderstorms that could produce lightning
  strikes, more fires could ignite and rapidly grow. It has already been a busy
  year for fire, with more than 44,800 ignitions across the US – more than any
  other year in the last decade, according to NIFC statistics. More than 16,500
  wildland firefighters and support staff are currently battling blazes covering
  a combined total of roughly 912,400 acres. Even after this heatwave subsides,
  the risks will remain. With minimal moisture in areas of California and the
  Pacific north-west, fire dangers are expected to climb through the next month
  and into October. Vegetation is dangerously dry and overgrown in parts of
  Nevada, California, Utah, Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming, according to NIFC
  advisories that “point to areas where hot, dry conditions can quickly turn a
  spark into a fast-moving fire”. The heat – which will bake moisture out of
  already parched landscapes and increase the potential for ignitions, rapid
  fire spread and extreme fire behavior – also create significant threats to
  public health. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts
  across the region, extending from Arizona to Washington, warning that the high
  temperatures could break numerous local daily records and will “pose a threat
  to anyone without effective cooling and adequate hydration”. The heat will
  also linger after the sun sets, offering little reprieve overnight. High
  night-time temperatures will add challenges to containing fires that erupt and
  increase the dangers for people unable to access cooling. “Numerous night-time
  temperature records are likely,” the NWS said in a Thursday warning. “Without
  A/C or cooling, the body can’t recover, increasing the risk of heat illness.”
  Extreme heat, often called a “silent killer”, already ranks as the most lethal
  weather-related disaster in the US, and deaths are increasing. Fueled by the
  climate crisis, and often exacerbated by concrete cityscapes that cook when
  temperatures rise, heatwaves are getting longer, larger and more intense. The
  heatwave is expected to begin calming down after Sunday in California and
  south-western states, but could continue through the middle of next week in
  the Pacific north-west.
