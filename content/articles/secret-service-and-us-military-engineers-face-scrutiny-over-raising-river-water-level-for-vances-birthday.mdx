  The US Secret Service and US military engineers are facing scrutiny after Adam
  Schiff, the California senator, demanded they answer questions about the Trump
  administration’s recent decision to change the water level of a lake in Ohio
  to facilitate a family boating trip for JD Vance on his birthday. The Secret
  Service has said that it requested the outflow of the Caesar Creek Lake in
  Ohio be changed shortly before the vice-president’s 2 August trip so that his
  security detail could safely navigate the Little Miami River, which the lake
  feeds into. The story was first reported by the Guardian last week. The Secret
  Service also said that neither Vance nor his staff knew that it had made the
  request. In a letter to Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense, and army corps
  of engineers leadership, Schiff suggested the use of funds to alter the
  outflow of the lake for personal use may have been inappropriate, and said he
  wanted information on the process and documentation of the decision. “The
  misuse of public water resources for the vice-president’s family is
  particularly offensive considering this administration’s cuts to federal
  agencies, cuts which are already harming outdoor recreation opportunities for
  American families,” Schiff wrote. The Guardian reported last week that was not
  unprecedented for military engineers in Louisville, Kentucky, who have
  jurisdiction over the area, to modify water outflows to accommodate public use
  – for example, for use in community river events and training for emergency
  responders. Regulations regarding requests for so-called “deviations” – or any
  changes to normal practices – require approval and documentation that
  demonstrates why the deviation is justified. This process also ensures that
  risks associated with any deviation – including a flood risk or other
  environmental impact – is detailed. The USACE said in a statement last week
  that the Secret Service request “met the operational criteria outlined in the
  Water Control Manual for Caesar Creek Lake and did not require a deviation
  from normal procedures”. But in his letter, Schiff accused the army corps
  leadership of improperly leveraging access to public services for personal use
  and waiving standard documentation that is required to identify and justify
  risks associated with the deviation. “Accordingly, I request an explanation of
  this USACE action and a commitment to no longer using federal resources for
  such unjustified and frivolous purposes,” Schiff wrote. The California
  Democrat also pointed to the Trump administration’s “frivolous release” of
  billions of gallons of water from California reservoirs as another instance in
  which the army corps executed “questionable abuses”. The water was released
  following an executive order from the White House for the alleged purpose of
  helping to fight the Los Angeles fires, though the army corps allegedly and
  reportedly knew the release would not be delivered to southern California
  directly. Vance’s communications director, Will Martin, has defended the canoe
  trip in an article on Breitbart, saying Democrats were trying to “turn it into
  a story about elitism”. He accused Democrats who were critical of Vance for
  benefiting from public infrastructure for his birthday trip of having “no clue
  how normal families operate” and that the idea of a family canoeing together
  is “completely foreign to them”. “The far-left media is desperate to smear
  Vice-President Vance and they’ve hit a new low by attacking him for enjoying
  his birthday with his wife and kids,” Martin said, referring to the Guardian.
