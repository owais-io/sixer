  Pick of the week Talk 90s to Me Miranda Sawyer gets into full-on nostalgia
  mode in this series dedicated to the days of Cool Britannia, Girl Power,
  Trainspotting and much more. If you’ve not had your fill of Oasis yet, her
  first episode is a loving deep dive into fandom and how one Mancunian outfit
  went where no 90s band had gone before. Says former Q editor Ted Kessler, it
  all came down to the Gallaghers’ undeniable strain of “electricity … chaos and
  anarchy”. Hannah J Davies Widely available, episodes weekly StanLand This tale
  of a podcaster transported to a weird world behind an Ikea wardrobe boasts a
  stacked cast including Jon Hamm, Rhea Seehorn and John Waters, and counts Bob
  Odenkirk as an executive producer. It’s a lot to live up to and sometimes
  feels laboured. But if sideways fantasy fiction is your thing, it may well
  hook you. HJD Widely available, episodes weekly No Easy Fix The Atlantic’s
  2024 miniseries Scripts was a powerful look at soaring rates of psychiatric
  drug use in the US. This time round, Ethan Brooks turns his attention to
  homelessness and addiction in San Francisco and touches on an important
  paradox: the fact that, despite being all-too visible to those around them,
  homeless people are often those who have been reported as missing. HJD Widely
  available, episodes weekly Write Me Dirty Another week, another Katherine Ryan
  podcast. This time, in each episode she asks two funny guests to make up a
  very filthy story. First up, Taskmaster alumna Stevie Martin (who dedicates
  hers to her nana) and Fatiha El-Ghorri are told to set their stories in a car
  showroom. Hollie Richardson Widely available, episodes weekly The Ballad of
  Big Mags Myles Bonnar’s six-parter for BBC Scotland is full of mind-boggling
  facts about Stirling’s Margaret Haney, whose criminal brood were once dubbed
  “the family from hell”. Bonnar succeeds in highlighting the contradictions of
  a woman who was both an anti-paedophile vigilante and a crook – and who may
  have even been the inspiration for EastEnders matriarch Big Mo. HJD Widely
  available, episodes weekly
