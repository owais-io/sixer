  Dinner or a shower? Older people fear tough choices when Australia’s new aged
  care changes are rolled out

  Margaret Duckett is scared for her friends. The 77-year-old pensioner is the
  recipient of a home care package – which allows her to get support with
  cleaning, gardening, transport, physiotherapy and podiatry – and some personal
  care, so she can continue living independently at her home in Sydney’s
  Riverview. When changes to the Aged Care Act are rolled out across the country
  in November, she will be grandfathered in and the costs of her support won’t
  change. But her friends who have not yet been assessed for home care packages
  will be forced to pay much more for basic care. Under the new act, home care
  package recipients, including those on the full pension, will be required to
  make co-payments for nonclinical services including – controversially –
  showering, dressing, continence support and wound care, as well as other
  things such as assistance with cooking, cleaning and gardening. “Too many
  pensioners go without food to visit a doctor already,” she says. But under the
  changes, she fears people will be forced to make even starker choices. Choices
  such as whether to pay for groceries or pay for help to take a shower. She is
  not alone in holding these concerns. Senators David Pocock and Penny
  Allman-Payne, who will launch a Senate inquiry this week into the Aged Care
  Act, say they are concerned the changes to the home care packages will either
  push people into residential care sooner or mean that they end up in hospital.
  “People are going to refrain from getting some aspects of care,” Allman-Payne
  says. “And that’s definitely going to contribute to bed block in hospitals and
  more people being pushed into residential aged care.” ‘Everybody deserves to
  have a shower’ At the heart of the changes to the new home care package
  provisions is the co-payments system. It means that care, which used to just
  come out of someone’s allotted home care package, will also require a
  co-payment from the individual. The government will cover the full cost of
  clinical care such as visits to doctors and specialists. But for “independence
  support” – which includes help with showering, medications, dressing and wound
  care – people will have to pay between 5% of the cost for full pensioners to
  up to 50% for a self-funded retiree. For everyday living support – which
  includes gardening and cleaning – the out-of-pocket costs will range from
  17.5% for full pensioners through to 80% for self-funded retirees. The middle
  category and, in particular, the inclusion of showering as an “independence
  support” rather than a “clinical” measure, has advocates particularly
  outraged. “Everybody deserves to have a shower a day or every second day. If
  they are wanting help with a shower, it means that they can’t do it for
  themselves,” says Amina Schipp, an aged care advocate. “So if they have to
  give up a shower because it means they’ll be able to afford dinner, that’s
  what they’ll do, but that’ll lead to other issues – UTIs and infections and
  whatever else.” If the new co-payment system applied to her, Duckett says she
  would have to reduce or cancel the fortnightly cleaning support that she gets,
  which is not a clinical need, but could lead to real health issues. “I often
  have ulcers and wounds and things. It’s a dangerous situation clinically, but
  [cleaning] is still categorised as a life choice.” Penny Allman-Payne, a
  Greens senator, says that when announcing the legislation, the government
  “made a big deal” of reassuring older people that they “didn’t need to worry
  because the government would foot 100% of the cost of clinical care. “And yet,
  the bulk of the care that an old person needs is actually not clinical care,”
  she says. “It’s help with showering, it’s help with taking medication, it’s
  help with mobility, feeding, all of those things and those things are not
  being fully covered by the government. “And that’s where … for some older
  people, those costs are going to be significantly increased and we are
  certainly hearing from people … saying, if I was in the same situation, we
  would have to forego some of this care.” ‘We’re not rolling in money’ The new
  Aged Care Act passed parliament in November 2024, aimed at responding to a
  range of recommendations from the royal commission into aged care quality and
  safety. Announcing the new act in September 2024, Anthony Albanese said it was
  “the greatest improvement in aged care in 30 years” and aimed to “support the
  growing number of older Australians choosing to retain their independence and
  remain in their homes as they age” as well as improve residential care and
  introduce laws to allow for stronger penalties against those who breach
  standards in aged care provision. The government says the new package will
  allow them to support another 300,000 people and has defended the co-payment
  system, saying that current arrangements aren’t sufficient to keep up with the
  rapidly growing demands on the aged care sector. Sam Rae, the minister for
  aged care and seniors, told Guardian Australia: “The Labor government’s
  reforms will support more older Australians to live and receive high-quality
  care in a safe and familiar environment, close to family and community. “The
  new Aged Care Act’s needs-based funding model will ensure that older people at
  a financial disadvantage will receive extra support to get the care they
  need.” Some aspects of the act have drawn praise from aged care groups, such
  as the Older Persons Action Network (OPAN), which has said while it doesn’t
  agree with everything in the new package, it’s “significantly better than the
  one we have”. It says the new package “delivers faster services to the
  community, gives older people more choice and control over their aged care
  [and] provides stronger protections”. A co-payment system for aged care is not
  a bad idea in principle, says the independent senator David Pocock, “as long
  as … it’s properly means tested and as long as it actually delivers on what
  was agreed, the government’s stated aims that these reforms will keep people
  at home for as long as possible. “I think this is one of the challenges … of
  aged care reforms is recognising that we do have an ageing population and how
  do we ensure that people who need support have the support they need to age
  with dignity, whilst not overburdening younger generations with the cost of
  paying for that.” But he says there is a lot of uncertainty about how the new
  system will work “and I think [there are] some very valid questions being
  raised about some of the services that will attract a co-payment”. The
  government has promised that those who were already approved for a home care
  package by 12 September 2024 would be no worse off under the new system, but
  have conceded that 30% of pensioners and 75% of part-pensioners approved for a
  home care package after this date are going to pay more for their care as a
  result of the changes. Duckett says the entire idea of the co-payment system
  is predicated on the myth that older people have money to burn, which is
  untrue, particularly for those on pensions like her. “The evidence is so very,
  very clear that co-payments differentially impact on the poor and
  disadvantaged,” she says, citing the statistic that nearly 60% of people over
  65 receive the age pension. “We’re not rolling in money … The budget is tight.
  “When you’re on an income of less than $30,000 a year, living in Sydney,
  there’s not much money left over to go and play with … Now if you’re going to
  have to start paying co-payments as well, at even a small level, it will have
  an impact.” ‘Fifteen thousand gets you bugger all’ Paul Absalom, 78, had polio
  when he was a child and for most of his life has lived with “one leg that’s
  pretty useless and the other one that’s nearly useless”. But about seven years
  ago, injuries from falling stopped him walking and he gets around on a
  scooter. Absalom says he lucked out: his Alice Springs home is – without him
  having to do much work to it – quite accessible for him. But it did require
  Absalom to renovate the bathroom nine years ago, removing the bathtub,
  retiling the room and getting an accessible shower. All up it cost Absalom
  about $20,000, which he paid for himself; it was not part of a home care
  arrangement. However, if someone in Absalom’s position were in need of a
  similar renovation under the new Aged Care Act, it appears they would not be
  able to get it. Home modifications are now capped at $15,000 for someone’s
  entire lifetime, with an additional $15,000 available for assistive technology
  like wheelchairs. “Fifteen thousand gets you bugger all, basically,” said
  Absalom. On top of the lifetime cap, under the old system, people could opt to
  save money from their home care package and then put the accrued funds towards
  a more expensive item such as a new shower, a stair lift, or ramps in and out
  of the house. The item still had to be approved by an occupational therapist
  as being necessary and falling within the guidelines of appropriate spending,
  but was a way for people to pay for expensive modifications – particularly as
  people over 65 are not eligible for NDIS. Under the new scheme, only $1,000,
  or 10% of someone’s home care package budget, can be carried over each quarter
  – which leaves all new recipients of a home care package “at a real
  disadvantage”. This is yet another area where Absalom and other advocates fear
  changes to the act will push people from being able to live at home
  independently into residential care, because of a lack of the support they
  would have had under the old system. “The government’s made a lot of noise
  about wanting to keep people in their own homes … But without the possibility
  of being able to make those home mods, it gets very difficult,” he says. “It’s
  nearly saying, that if you can’t afford to do them, you’ll have to go into
  residential care.”
