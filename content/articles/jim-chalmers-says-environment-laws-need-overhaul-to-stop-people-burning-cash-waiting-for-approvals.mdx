  waiting for approvals’

  The federal treasurer says too many people across Australia are “burning cash
  waiting for approvals to build things” while flagging the Albanese
  government’s overhaul of environment laws could help boost productivity. Labor
  is planning to reform the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation
  Act after failing to deliver promised changes in its first term. Jim Chalmers,
  speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of next week’s next economic reform
  roundtable, said better rules and processes were needed for faster approvals,
  while still protecting nature. “It will be one of the main ways that people
  think through our regulatory challenges and our challenges around the time it
  takes to get projects approved,” Chalmers said. Sign up: AU Breaking News
  email “In all the consultation I’ve been doing – in housing, renewable energy
  projects – there are too many instances where people are burning cash waiting
  for approvals to build things that we desperately want people to build.”
  Legislating a federal environment protection agency was a “very high and
  immediate” priority for the re-elected Labor government, the new environment
  minister, Murray Watt, said in May. Watt signalled he wanted nature laws
  passed quickly to avoid another drawn-out political fight. The former Treasury
  boss and environment campaigner Ken Henry has pitched the redesign as a
  productivity measure, comments Chalmers welcomed in his Guardian interview. He
  said other stakeholders had expressed similar views about the Howard-era laws
  to him privately in recent months. “The status quo is no longer acceptable on
  the EPBC Act,” the treasurer said. The goal of cutting cumbersome
  environmental regulation while maintaining environmental protections has
  eluded both sides of politics for more than a decade. The Abbott government
  campaigned against “green tape” and sought to give state and territory
  governments sole responsibility for approving projects. The prime minister,
  Anthony Albanese, scuttled a deal with the Greens to pass the so-called
  “nature positive laws” at the end of 2024, fearing a backlash in
  resources-reliant Western Australia. Labor wants to push changes through
  federal parliament within 18 months, likely as one package of laws rather than
  in multiple stages – as attempted by the former environment minister Tanya
  Plibersek. Treasury included reforms to environmental rules that would free up
  an estimated 30,000 additional housing approvals in a list of potential
  outcomes from the roundtable, which was leaked to the ABC on Thursday.
  Chalmers said there were already “green shoots” emerging in Australia’s
  housing affordability and supply crisis, promising further moves to accelerate
  construction and planning approvals. Welcoming an uptick in recent official
  homebuilding data, the treasurer said Labor was determined to speed up
  approvals for as many as 65,000 new homes, part of efforts to build 1.2m new
  dwellings by 2029. “We’ll do better on housing if everyone does their bit,”
  Chalmers said. “I’m confident that people in all parts of the system,
  investors, states and territories, certainly the commonwealth, the industry,
  there is a real appetite to work together to build more homes more quickly,
  and so that’s why we’ve got such an open mind to the ideas that people have
  been raising with us.” The 1.2m target will be a challenge for the Albanese
  government, with Treasury and industry warning sluggish approval times and
  workforce shortages will make it hard to reach. But Chalmers said work by the
  housing minister, Clare O’Neil, and this week’s change by corporate regulator
  Asic to review rules requiring superannuation funds to disclose stamp duty
  paid on residential real estate will help speed up new construction. The
  so-called RG97 rule forces investors to declare stamp duty costs and is
  considered a deterrent to some investment. If implemented, the change could
  mean an extra 35,000 homes being built, Chalmers said. “The last four or five
  datasets on housing, we’ve seen green shoots.” Chalmers used an address to the
  National Press Club on 18 June to suggest the roundtable could deliver
  concrete tax reform proposals, declaring that “no sensible progress can be
  made on productivity, resilience or budget sustainability without proper
  consideration of more tax reform”. But weeks later, it was clear that the
  prime minister had become concerned the government was losing control of
  expectations, and moved quickly to rein in excitement over what the roundtable
  would achieve. “The government will make decisions, and the roundtable isn’t a
  substitute for government decision-making,” Albanese said on 6 August. Days
  later, the prime minister killed off any immediate hopes of tax reform. “The
  only tax policy that we’re implementing is the one that we took to the
  election,” he said. Labor has faced calls from unions for a minimum 25% tax
  rate on high earners. The ACTU called for a 25% levy on LNG exports and caps
  to limit diesel fuel rebate payments to big corporations, as well as a
  four-day week for some workers. The Productivity Commission has already
  proposed slashing the company tax rate to 20% for firms with less than $1bn in
  annual turnover, as well as a 5% net cashflow tax on about 500 of the
  country’s biggest businesses, including miners and supermarkets. Albanese has
  ruled out changes to the rate and base of the GST and negative gearing, while
  changes to generous capital gains tax concessions and negative gearing rules
  for property investors look too politically sensitive. With expectations now
  firmly lowered, questions have been asked about the value of the three-day
  roundtable, particularly in the context of the enormous ministerial and
  departmental effort involved. “There’s been a heap of effort, working around
  the clock for four weeks to make sure that people’s voices are heard and that
  we can shape up a meaningful and useful roundtable,” Chalmers said. “I see it
  as three days to help inform three budgets.”
