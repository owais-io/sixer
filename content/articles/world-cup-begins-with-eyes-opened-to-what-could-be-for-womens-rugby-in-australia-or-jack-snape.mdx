  The world of sport spins fast, as match follows tournament follows season in a
  dizzying cycle of sporting entertainment. So when should Australia care? When
  should the collective head look up from the school lunches and phone bills of
  the everyday and tune in? The “underdog” Wallaroos begin their Women’s Rugby
  World Cup campaign in England this weekend, and this one means something. Just
  ask fans of the host nation’s Red Roses, who have already sold out the World
  Cup final in anticipation of the nation’s first title since 2010. The 82,000
  capacity crowd at Twickenham will be the largest in women’s rugby history. Ask
  Wallaroos captain Siokapesi Palu, who after witnessing the huge interest in
  England this week expressed hope that soon Australia would follow. “It’s good
  to see with our own eyes and with the lens of where women’s sport probably
  isn’t as visible back home than it is here,” she said. “It’s a great benchmark
  in the standards that we want.” Ask Australian veterans Arabella McKenzie and
  Emily “Horse” Robinson, who both missed out on a place in the Wallaroos squad
  in pre-tournament selection shocks. Rather than retreat in disappointment,
  they have thrust themselves into the spotlight by starting a podcast they joke
  is partly for counselling. “It’s an incredible event coming up, and we want to
  really spotlight the Wallaroos and the other rugby teams and the best players
  from around the world,” McKenzie said on the Back Row Seats, part of the
  Female Athlete Project. “This is the first World Cup in nine years that I
  haven’t been to, so it’s a lot to take in,” Robinson said. “But it’s positive
  that we can shine a light on our mates and the game that we both still love.”
  Ask Jaime Fernandez, father of Wallaroos lock Ashley and Rugby Australia’s
  manager of women’s high performance, who followed up a pre-tournament
  interview with a heart-felt text message about how this group was “special”,
  and how their sacrifices and progress warranted more attention. Fernandez won
  a silver medal for Australia in the men’s eight at Sydney 2000, and came to
  Rugby Australia from a decade in elite rowing in 2023. It was part of an
  expansion of investment undertaken to improve the performance of the
  Wallaroos, who are currently ranked No 6 in the world but whose reputation
  trails well behind international benchmarks of England, New Zealand and
  Canada. A year before Fernandez arrived, Rugby Australia had won the right to
  host the 2029 World Cup, as part of the sport’s so-called golden decade.
  “There was this real energy and drive to move and shift, in the first
  instance, the XVs game forward from where it was,” he said. “It was just this
  perfect alignment of things occurring for us to give it a kickstart.” Look at
  the list of the most experienced Wallaroos, and you get some indication of the
  progress and expanded schedule of the past few years. Headed by Ash Marsters
  with 41 caps, nine of the 10 most capped are currently still playing. In the
  years before Fernandez came in, the women’s XVs programme relied on club and
  state programmes to develop talent, with few national staff. Now, a typical
  annual programme will involve 10 or more Tests, as well as tours and training
  camps. Around 40 players are now contracted by Rugby Australia in XVs,
  alongside 20 or so in sevens, with the best players earning close to $100,000
  per year. Emerging fullback Caitlyn Halse said more time with coaches has
  allowed her to improve her kicking and decision-making. “I feel like I’ve
  gotten a lot better at kicking and more knowledge of kicking, like when to
  pull the trigger on a 50-22, or when to kick long or do a high bomb or
  something like that,” she said. Halse is one of several young talents pursuing
  XVs despite the lure of women’s sevens, which gained national recognition when
  Australia won gold at Rio in 2016. Thanks to government and Australian Olympic
  Committee support and the high profile of the global sevens tour, that
  programme has been a leader for local women’s rugby for more than a decade.
  But as XVs builds momentum, Rugby Australia is working to bridge the gap
  between the two formats. The sevens representatives were given a chance to
  fast track their development in XVs this year. Only Tia Hinds made it all the
  way to the Wallaroos World Cup squad, with some facing injury and others
  withdrawing from consideration. Former Wallaby Mat Rogers, the manager of
  sevens star Maddi Levi, has been critical of the process, saying the
  transitioning players were “set up to fail” this year. Fernandez said a
  historic separation between the programmes and competing calendars has
  prompted a lower level of cooperation in the past, but now there’s a “genuine
  intent” to work together and by 2029 a combined squad could be a reality.
  “It’s just going to take some time and patience to work our way through that,”
  he said. “Ideally, we have a group of players who could play across both that
  train together, prepare together, and we are then more targeted around our
  benchmark events.” But for now, the Wallaroos’ focus is on the first pool
  match against Samoa this week, screened at prime time on Saturday night in the
  eastern states. Fernandez hopes they enjoy it. “They feel the weight of
  expectation, they feel pressure,” he said. “But this shouldn’t feel like work,
  this should be something that you truly just have a smile on your dial when
  you run out.”
