  I’m the only one who’s not been in. The floor’s open. Someone goes in for
  their second round, buying me some time with a two-step, a dribble and out.
  Another agonising pause. I know Tiger’s looking at me – he’s not going to let
  me get out of this, so I jump in. I’d been working on my running man, but the
  two‑step is my anchor now. And I just keep two-stepping. It’s fitful, it’s
  awkward, it’s out of time – but I’m doing it, footworking in the middle of a
  dance circle. “You’re part of the culture now!” beams Tiger, as I jitterbug
  back to the sidelines. It’s my first time attending a footwork practice
  session, led by the instructor Tiger in the foyer of Central Saint Martins art
  college in London. I heard about these sessions through an “open decks” night
  dedicated to footwork, the furiously fast and bassy style of dance music from
  Chicago. The dance actually came before the music, but that part of it has
  never really caught on in the UK. Times are changing, though. Not since
  flailing to dubstep at university have I felt so enthused by the dancing side
  of club music. From the twist in the 60s to the migraine skank in the 00s,
  music fans have always loved to throw down moves – and surely the point of
  going to a nightclub is to dance. But nowadays that’s often far from the case.
  Phones have turned clubs into vehicles for social media content, with some DJs
  becoming exasperated at the way that punters – who often stand still, filming
  big-screen visuals, or each other – seem more interested in documenting the
  night than dancing. This can create a vibe-killing feedback loop. “I asked
  some friends why they don’t dance in public and some said because of the fear
  of being filmed,” the rapper Tyler, the Creator recently posted by way of
  introduction to his dance‑focused new album, Don’t Tap the Glass. “I thought:
  damn, a natural form of expression and a certain connection they have with
  music is now a ghost.” In Britain, it’s also getting harder to go out clubbing
  at all, due to the cost of living crisis and a drop in the number of
  nightclubs – about 400 have closed in the past five years. So, across the
  country, grassroots dance communities are countering this by creating safe
  spaces for people to learn new moves and feel emboldened to share them on the
  dancefloor. “People need something to do on a night out,” says Eve Burgsoul,
  who co-runs Bristol Northern Soul Club with Levanna McLean. Dancing, she says,
  means “they are in the experience”. Northern soul spun out of the Twisted
  Wheel nightclub in Manchester in the 60s before spreading to Wigan, Blackpool
  and Stafford in the 70s and generating an entire subculture of British people
  spinning, dipping and doing other elaborate moves to obscure, uptempo US soul
  music. It survived as a hobby for older generations, but Bristol Northern Soul
  Club, and other nights like it, have galvanised a younger crowd. Their videos
  of McLean shuffling to soul classics and pop songs on the streets of Bristol
  have been such a hit that they have gained traction worldwide. “We’re viral in
  Russia because our dancing got remixed to a techno song,” says Burgsoul.
  Clubbers at Bristol Northern Soul Club nights learn the basics of keeping time
  and focusing on their feet. Knowing even some rudimentary moves means that
  “rather than standing there with a drink, waiting for someone to talk to you,
  you’ve got something to do”, says Burgsoul. “You feel invested in the event,”
  adds McLean. Learning to dance opens you up to whole new communities –
  something those in the ballroom scene know intimately. In the US, ballroom
  culture has provided solidarity for Black and Latin LGBTQ+ people since the
  60s; the dancer Les Child formed the first British vogue collective, the House
  of Child, in the 80s. These houses can serve as surrogate families for
  community members estranged from their biological relations, as well as teams
  that perform for renown and cash prizes. Vogue is an integral feature of these
  balls. It’s a sharp battle dance consisting of five basic elements: spins and
  dips, duckwalk, catwalk, hands and floor. Smily discovered ballroom after he
  was disowned by his family at 17 and happened upon a vogue class at Studio 25
  in Manchester, hosted by the ballroom dancer and Manchester Ballroom Community
  (MBC) founder Sacha 007. Smily immediately took to the acrobatic style.
  “Voguing was a wholesome release of dopamine for me,” he says. “I channelled
  my energy into every move and people enjoyed it. Eventually, I went on to walk
  in Paris.” Smily now runs MBC and hosts open sessions where newbies pay to
  learn the basic elements of vogue. MBC has a large pool of beginners keen to
  walk balls, but nowhere for them to perform, since most vogue events happen in
  London and many can’t afford the trip. “Manchester definitely needed more
  queer, trans, Black and POC [people of colour] spaces,” says Smily. With money
  from the workshops and other fundraising events, MBC has managed to throw a
  few balls in Manchester and now hosts one of the city’s first OTA (open to
  all) vogue nights. Partnerships such as these are bringing dance out of the
  studio and into public spaces. In London, the footwork promoter 160 Unity has
  joined forces with After Werks, the class I attend, resulting in dance circles
  at the front of their last two nights in London. “The footwork crew has
  brought something to dance music that I’ve yearned for so long: communal
  dance,” says Chris Kanski, a 160 Unity punter and After Werks regular. He
  arrived at After Werks from a background in hardcore punk and metal. “Footwork
  nights give that spontaneous expression and that challenge that’s so special
  in hardcore punk. There are eyes on you and people are looking both at what
  you express and what you can do.” The same feeling is evident in the UK jazz
  dance scene, which took off in the 70s as teenagers began leaping, stomping
  and skipping to the sounds of acid jazz and Latin fusion at clubs such as
  Chaplins in Birmingham. The craze migrated south, where DJs such as Gilles
  Peterson turned London into the new mecca of UK jazz dance with his nights at
  Dingwalls. It endures today. At the Bath House community building in London, I
  witness the jazz dance luminary Masumi Endo work tirelessly to encourage
  bystanders on to the floor for Jazzy Sport London’s No Nation Under a Groove
  party, which brings together three dance communities: After Werks, Epic Jam
  (breakdance) and Footnotes (jazz dance). By the end of the evening, the
  dancing spirit has reached such a fever pitch that the whole room is moving
  together in one bubbling cauldron of styles. “There’s nothing like playing to
  an active audience who are sweating their tits off and really feeling the
  music,” says Jayson Wynters, who DJs at the jazz dance event Come Sunday at
  Hockley Social Club in Birmingham alongside Nick Schlittner. One of Come
  Sunday’s main challenges has been holding on to their young dancers, many of
  whom move to London in search of job opportunities in TV and theatre. But in
  M.uuya they have a loyal, 32-year-old regular who relishes the
  intergenerational side of the event. “It has lineage,” he says. “You’re
  entering a community that’s larger than that moment in time.” Back at the
  footwork dance class, Tiger remembers how bouncers and DJs would welcome him
  into his local nightclub in Muswell Hill, London, where he went weekly to
  practise his moves. That was 18 years ago; he wonders whether “DJs and
  promoters should reach out to dancers more”. When they do, the effect can be
  intoxicating: earlier this year, he was the star of the night when the
  footwork legends RP Boo and DJ Spinn played at Venue MOT in south London. “If
  I’m doing the Biz Markie” – an old-school hip-hop move – “next to you in the
  club, I can show you what to do,” he says. And while he believes dancers are
  inherently free in expression, he argues that knowing some basic moves allows
  you to have the most amount of fun on the dancefloor. He’s not wrong. My
  two-step has kept me occupied during an average club night on Rye Lane in
  Peckham, London, and my erk’n’jerks – another footwork move – have left me
  exhausted and elated after a particularly sweaty set in Bermondsey. My dancing
  isn’t going to save a club from its financial woes, but if promoters can
  partner with grassroots collectives, organise workshops and encourage dancers
  to the floor, they can benefit from an integral aspect of club culture that
  people, old and young, are clearly craving. “People love it,” says Kanski.
