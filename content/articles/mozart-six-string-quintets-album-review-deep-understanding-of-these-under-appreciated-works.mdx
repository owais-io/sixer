  Mozart: Six String Quintets album review – deep understanding of these
  under-appreciated works
sectionName: Music
webPublicationDate: '2025-09-04T14:00:55Z'
bodyText: >-
  Formed by string players from some of Europe’s leading orchestras and
  ensembles specifically to give historically informed performances of Mozart’s
  string quintets, Spunicunifait takes its name from a nonsense word used by
  Mozart in one of his letters, the meaning of which remains a mystery. “We
  wanted to make a recording that would approach the quintets with the same
  reverence that [Mozart’s] quartets receive,” they say, and that approach
  results in performances of the six works that have transparency, flexibility
  and easy athleticism. There are the five well-known mature quintets, as well
  as the early B flat work K174, for which Spuncunifait play two versions of its
  finale. All are composed for a quintet of strings with two violas (unlike
  Boccherini’s quintets and Schubert’s famous C major quintet, which employ two
  cellos). The players – Lorenza Borrani and Maia Cabeza (violin), Max Mandel
  and Simon Von Rahden (viola) and Luise Buchberger (cello) – use a mix of
  18th-century instruments and 21st-century copies; the recorded sound is close
  and involving. Not all aspects of the group’s approach will be to all tastes:
  vibrato is very sparingly used, and its absence can often be starkly
  effective, but the tendency to link notes in phrases with tiny glissandi can
  sometimes seem a little overdone. These are minor quibbles, though. The
  performances reveal the group’s musicality and deep understanding of these
  under-appreciated works in every bar. Stream it on Apple Music (above) or on
  Spotify
