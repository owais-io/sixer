  files’

  Four days after JD Vance reportedly asked top Trump administration officials
  to come up with a new communications strategy for dealing with the scandal
  around the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he appears to have put
  his foot in it, sparking a new round of online outrage even as he tried to
  defuse the furor. In an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday, the
  vice-president tried to deflect criticism of the administration’s refusal to
  release the Epstein files by blaming Democrats. He accused Joe Biden of doing
  “absolutely nothing” about the scandal when he was in the White House. “And
  now President Trump has demanded full transparency from this. And yet somehow
  the Democrats are attacking him and not the Biden administration, which did
  nothing for four years,” he said. Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine
  Maxwell, was convicted of conspiring with Epstein to sexually abuse multiple
  minor girls and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison during the Biden
  administration. If Vance’s attempt to switch public blame onto Democrats was
  the big idea to emerge from his strategy meeting with attorney general Pam
  Bondi and FBI director Kash Patel, which according to CNN he convened at the
  White House last week, then their labours appear to have backfired. (Vance
  denied to Fox that they had discussed Epstein at all, though he did
  acknowledge the meeting took place.) Within minutes of the Fox News interview
  being broadcast, social media began to hum with renewed cries of “release the
  files!” Clips of Vance smearing Democrats quickly began to circulate on X. “We
  know that Jeffrey Epstein had a lot of connections with leftwing politicians
  and leftwing billionaires … Democrat billionaires and Democrat political
  leaders went to Epstein island all the time. Who knows what they did,” he
  said. Vance also repeated Trump’s previously debunked claim that Bill Clinton
  had visited Epstein’s private island dozens of times. Clinton has acknowledged
  using Epstein’s jet, but denied ever visiting his island. “Fine. Release all
  the files,” was the riposte from Bill Kristol, the prominent conservative
  Never Trumper who urged the documents to be made public with “no redactions of
  clients, enablers, and see-no-evil associates”. Jon Favreau, Barack Obama’s
  former head speechwriter, replied: “Release the names! Democrats, Republicans,
  billionaires, or not. What are you afraid of, JD Vance?” Favreau added that
  Trump’s name “is in the Epstein files”. That was an apparent reference to a
  report in the Wall Street Journal last month that a justice department review
  of the documents conducted under Bondi had found that the president’s name did
  appear “multiple times”. Other social media users used the Fox News interview
  as an excuse to re-run video of Trump in the hosting Epstein and Maxwell at
  Mar-a-Lago. Epstein died in August 2019, during Trump’s first presidency,
  while the financier and socialite was awaiting trial in a Manhattan jail; the
  death was ruled a suicide. The White House has been caught in a bind over the
  Epstein affair which spawned conspiracy theories among many of Trump’s
  supporters, which now senior figures in the administration had actively
  encouraged during the 2024 campaign. In July the justice department announced
  that there was no Epstein client list and that no more files would be made
  public, a decision that clashed with earlier statements from top Trump
  officials, including Bondi’s statement in February that a client list was
  “sitting on my desk right now to review”. The decision triggered an immediate
  and ongoing uproar that crossed the partisan political divide. Among the most
  viral clips in the aftermath of that reversal was video of Vance himself
  telling the podcaster Theo Von, two weeks before the election: “Seriously, we
  need to release the Epstein list, that is an important thing.” In his Fox News
  interview Vance also warned that “you’re going to see a lot of people get
  indicted” after Trump accused Obama of “treason” and called for his
  predecessor to be prosecuted. The director of national intelligence, Tulsi
  Gabbard, has passed documents to the justice department that she claims show
  that the Obama administration maliciously tried to hurt Trump by linking
  Russian interference in the 2016 election to him. Obama has dismissed Trump’s
  call for his prosecution as weak and ridiculous.
