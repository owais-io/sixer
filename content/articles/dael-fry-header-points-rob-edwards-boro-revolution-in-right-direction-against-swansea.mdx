  It is almost exactly 30 years since goals from Craig Hignett and Jan Åge
  Fjørtoft secured Middlesbrough a Premier League victory against Chelsea as
  they played their first game at a brand new Riverside Stadium. Even the
  presence of Ruud Gullit at sweeper in a visiting side featuring Mark Hughes in
  attack could not deny Boro a 2-0 win as an exciting decade peopled by, among
  other luminaries, Juninho, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Nick Barmby, Gareth Southgate,
  Gaizka Mendieta and Bolo Zenden dawned. Along the way Boro would reach three
  League Cup finals, winning one, while also losing FA Cup and, most excitingly,
  Uefa Cup finals. Not to mention bouncing back from a one-season second-tier
  sabbatical. Teesside was firmly on not just the UK but the European map. Or at
  least it was until the economic profile of football ownership changed and
  Steve Gibson’s club struggled to compete at the very highest level. These days
  the Riverside rarely rocks to capacity crowds and, after eight seasons out of
  the Premier League, a relatively modest 26,286 congregated to see how their
  club’s latest manager, Rob Edwards, shaped up. The good news for Boro fans is
  that the answer is so far, so good, after Dael Fry’s winning header secured
  three points. “I’m really pleased,” said Edwards. “It was a tough game but
  lovely to keep a clean sheet and score from a set piece. Swansea’s strikers
  had very few touches of the ball and we played some good stuff at times.”
  Edwards is big on connectivity and has taken the admirable step of attending a
  plethora of supporters’ events over the summer, canvassing opinions while
  attempting to tap into the local psyche. The former Luton manager has switched
  formation to 3-4-2-1 while endeavouring to wean his squad off the increasingly
  slow possession-heavy approach favoured by Michael Carrick. Edwards wants to
  see his team in high-tempo, hard-pressing mode but here Boro’s players
  sometimes seemed to forget Carrick had been sacked and reverted to their old
  habits. If they experienced a fortunate defensive reprieve when Ronald’s
  half-volley flew fractionally wide, Swansea’s Lawrence Vigouroux did extremely
  well to fingertip Morgan Whittaker’s shot on to the bar Like Edwards, Alan
  Sheehan was anxious to endear himself to a newish public in his first
  competitive match after being promoted from Swansea’s caretaker manager to the
  real thing. How the Irishman could have done with Luka Modric, a minority
  investor in Swansea, not being otherwise engaged staffing Milan’s midfield.
  Sheehan speaks enthusiastically of the heavily decorated Croat, explaining
  Modric has passed some invaluable technical tips on to the squad and is
  apparently looking forward to visiting south Wales soon. Another celebrity
  minority investor is the American rap star Snoop Dogg and he and his contacts
  are apparently already doing wonders to boost Swansea’s commercial revenue
  streams. Snoop Dogg is also scheduled to visit the Liberty Stadium this season
  and has been forgiven for an unfortunate incident in 2011 when he performed in
  south Wales wearing a Cardiff replica shirt. Fry headed Boro into an early
  second-half lead with a stooping connection with Whittaker’s corner. It proved
  the cue for the home side to take control and only a timely headed
  interception on Cameron Burgess’s part prevented Hayden Hackney shooting Boro
  further ahead. Hackney’s eye for a pass dictates that the 23-year-old
  midfielder does not lack admirers. Indeed Boro recently accepted a £20m bid
  for Hackney from Ipswich only for a player who has been watched repeatedly by
  Newcastle, among others, to reject that move. “It’s a win-win situation,” said
  Edwards. “If Hayden’s here, great; he’s a brilliant player. But, if he’s not,
  the funds will be available to spend.” Sheehan, too, is presiding over a
  stylistic shift as Swansea transition from a possession-monopolising approach
  to a more direct one. “We didn’t create anywhere enough; they made sure we
  played down the sides a bit too much,” said Swansea’s manager. “No excuses,
  just disappointment.” The suspicion, though, is that Sheehan’s will be far
  from the only team to stumble in the shadow of the Cleveland Hills as, 30
  years after the Riverside’s doors first opened, Edwards aims to return the
  good times to Teesside.
