bodyText: >-
  Gunk opens with new divorcee Jules sitting at home cradling a baby who is 24
  hours and 17 minutes old, feeding him colostrum from a syringe. After being
  fed, the baby cries, which Jules interprets as a howl of rejection: “He has no
  language to tell me I’m not right for him.” We learn that Jules isn’t the
  child’s biological parent; the birth mother is Nim who, shortly after being
  stitched up, left the hospital ward and seemingly vanished. Concerned for her
  wellbeing, the hospital called the police who questioned Jules. “Nim has run
  away before,” she told them. “And she’s good at hiding.” Set in Brighton, this
  is Saba Sams’s first novel, the follow-up to her much-admired short story
  collection Send Nudes. Where that book examined the lives of girls coming of
  age, Gunk has an older heroine in Jules, who is desperate to have a child. Her
  alcoholic ex-husband, Leon, who ran a student nightclub and with whom she
  tried and failed to conceive, cheated on her multiple times with his young
  staff. When one of the bartenders he slept with, Nim, discovered she was
  pregnant, she and Jules came to an arrangement and moved in together. The
  narrator is the actor Lizzie Schenk, who imbues Sams’s protagonists with depth
  and humanity. A poignant tale of motherhood and partnerships reimagined, Gunk
  shows how life can be simultaneously messy and beautiful. For Jules, life had
  been “small and dark” before Nim “prised her way inside and detonated it. All
  around me were smithereens. I looked up, and found scraps of sky.” • Available
  via WF Howes, 4hr 25min Further listening Shouting Out Loud Audrey Golden,
  White Rabbit, 12hr 42min Golden narrates her biography of the seminal yet
  latterly underappreciated British band the Raincoats, who formed in 1977 and
  cast a long shadow over the careers of Nirvana, Bikini Kill and Sonic Youth.
  How to Lose Your Mother Molly Jong-Fast, Picador, 6hr 55min The daughter of
  writer Erica Jong documents her annus horribilis, when her husband was treated
  for cancer, her aunt and stepfather died and her mother, with whom she had a
  difficult relationship, was diagnosed with dementia. Read by the author.
