  It has been a fixture of bake sales and cafes in Australia for more than a
  century. Now the lamington is making its debut on the British high street as
  Marks &amp; Spencer launches its own version. The chain will stock two
  varieties: a “classic” chocolate and coconut lamington and a caramelised
  biscuit version, which went viral on social media after being launched by
  Woolworths in Australia last month. Both will be baked in the UK and sold in
  packs of two for £4. The lamington is traditionally a square piece of sponge
  dipped in chocolate icing and rolled in desiccated coconut. In Australia and
  New Zealand it is regarded as a national treat and is commonly seen in a
  raspberry version. M&amp;S’s take on the classic uses a buttermilk-enriched
  chocolate sponge coated in chocolate sauce and coconut flakes and finished
  with jam and buttercream. The caramelised biscuit version swaps coconut for
  biscuit crumb and is topped with buttercream and salted caramel sauce. Alice
  Birch, a product developer for bakery treats at M&amp;S Food, said:
  “Lamingtons are definitely the most iconic cake from down under and it’s very
  exciting to be the first to bring our version of this beloved Aussie classic
  to the UK high street. Ours are extra special – they’re hand-finished with
  toppings and super indulgent thanks to the rich chocolate sponge and chocolate
  sauce coating.” The cake is thought to have originated in Queensland in the
  1890s when the chef of the governor, Lord Lamington, is said to have used
  leftover sponge, chocolate and coconut to feed unexpected guests. The M&amp;S
  lamingtons go on sale from Wednesday and are also available on Ocado.
