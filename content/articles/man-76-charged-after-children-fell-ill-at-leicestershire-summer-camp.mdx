  A 76-year-old man has been charged after a number of children became unwell at
  a summer camp in Leicestershire. Jon Ruben, of Ruddington, Nottingham, has
  been charged with three counts of wilful ill treatment of a child. The charges
  relate to three children at the rural camp in the village of Stathern,
  Leicestershire police said on Friday. Police launched an investigation after
  children attending the camp at Stathern Lodge, near Melton, became unwell.
  Emergency services attended the scene and eight children, all boys aged
  between eight and 11, along with one adult, were taken to hospital as a
  precaution. All of the patients have subsequently been discharged. Ruben has
  been remanded into custody and will appear at Leicester magistrates court on
  Saturday. Janine McKinney, chief crown prosecutor for CPS East Midlands, said:
  “The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the prosecution of a 76-year-old
  man with child cruelty offences following a police investigation into a summer
  camp held at Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire. “This decision has been made
  after reviewing a file of evidence from Leicestershire police. “Jonathon Ruben
  will be charged with three offences of wilful ill treatment of a child
  relating to three boys. He will appear at Leicester magistrates court on
  Saturday 2 August. “This has been an extremely upsetting and shocking moment
  for the community, and especially for the children and parents most directly
  affected. “We would like to remind all concerned that there are now active
  criminal proceedings against Mr Ruben and he has the right to a fair trial.
  There must be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online that
  may in any way prejudice these proceedings.” Leicestershire police had
  originally said the incident happened on Monday, before amending it to Sunday,
  and it remains unclear whether officers only responded on Monday and whether
  that is why the force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police
  Conduct (IOPC). The force said in a statement: “The owners and operators of
  Stathern Lodge are independent from those people who use or hire the lodge and
  are not connected to the incident.” The investigation is being led by the East
  Midlands special operations unit’s major incident team. DI Neil Holden, the
  senior investigating officer, said: “We understand the concern this incident
  will have caused to parents, guardians and the surrounding community.” He
  added: “This is a complex and sensitive investigation and we will continue to
  provide updates to both parents and guardians and the public as and when we
  can.” The IOPC said: “Our assessment team has examined all available evidence
  and concluded the matter should be independently investigated by the IOPC.
  “The investigation will look at whether there were any breaches of
  professional behaviour – namely a failure to carry out duties and
  responsibilities – that resulted in a delay in Leicestershire police’s
  response to what was later declared a critical incident.”
