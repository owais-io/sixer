  Earlier this summer, access to climate.gov – one of the most widely used
  portals of climate information on the internet – was thwarted by the Trump
  administration, and its production team was fired in the process. The website
  offered years’ worth of accessibly written material on climate science. The
  site is technically still online but has been intentionally buried by the team
  of political appointees who now run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
  Administration. Now, a team of climate communication experts – including many
  members of the former climate.gov team – is working to resurrect its content
  into a new organization with an expanded mission. Their effort’s new website,
  climate.us, would not only offer public-facing interpretations of climate
  science, but could also begin to directly offer climate-related services, such
  as assisting local governments with mapping increased flooding risk due to
  climate change. The effort is being led by climate.gov’s former managing
  editor, Rebecca Lindsey, who, although now unemployed, has recruited several
  of her former colleagues to volunteer their time in an attempt to build
  climate.us into a thriving non-profit organization. “A lot of federal
  employees are grieving over the sense that they’ve not just lost a job, but a
  vocation,” said Lindsey. “None of us were ready to let go of climate.gov and
  the mission.” In the first few weeks after the Trump administration ended
  their work, Lindsey’s new team has received a steady flow of outside support,
  including legal support, and a short-term grant that has helped them develop a
  vision for what they’d like to do next. “The things that were most popular on
  climate.gov were things that basically just taught people about climate, both
  natural climate and climate change,” said Lindsey. “There is a need for
  content that helps people achieve basic climate literacy independent of an
  agency.” As multi-year veterans of the federal bureaucracy, at times they’ve
  been surprised by the possibilities that the new effort might offer. “We’re
  allowed to use TikTok now,” said Lindsey. “We’re allowed to have a little bit
  of fun. We have a group chat. We’re diving into things that are not part of
  our wheelhouse.” The climate.us team is also in the process of soft-launching
  a crowdsourced fundraising drive that Lindsey hopes they can leverage into
  more permanent support from a major foundation. Lindsey also set up an email
  address to contact the team to offer in-kind support. “Someone bought our
  domain name for us. And we have somebody that’s volunteered web hosting space
  for this phase. But we do not yet have the sort of large operational funding
  that we will need if we’re going to actually transition climate.gov operations
  to the nonprofit space.” In the meantime, Lindsey and her team have found
  themselves spending the summer knee-deep in the logistics of building a major
  non-profit from scratch. “We’ve all had to let go of the 9-5 mentality and
  basically try to do things as quickly as possible,” said one member of
  Lindsey’s new team who previously worked with her at climate.gov but asked not
  to be named for fear of retribution. “By carrying on the legacy of climate.gov
  and actually trying to republish the most vital parts of climate.gov, we hope
  that we can be a cornerstone,” said Lindsey. “We hope that it will provide a
  critical mass that will attract other partners who want to be part of the
  effort.” Given the context of why Lindsey is doing this work at this time and
  in this way, it has been an emotional summer. The effort has the sheen of
  equal parts science journalism and a cathartic personal vendetta against an
  administration that has all but declared war on federal science efforts.
  “We’ve been optimistic and alternating between being energized and feeling
  like this is a good thing and we’re on the right path and then, of course,
  being terrified that we’re not going to be able to pull it off and six months
  is going to have passed and we all should have been looking for new jobs and
  we didn’t,” said Lindsey. “What’s happening can feel so overwhelming that it’s
  easy to feel like you’re powerless to do anything about it,” said Lindsey’s
  team member. “But sometimes you have to just look out and see what’s within
  your reach. And this problem is within our reach, so we just see it as sort of
  doing our part.” Lindsey also told the Guardian that all the content for
  climate.gov is still up if you know where to look, which when she found that
  out, made her even more upset. “This is information that the taxpayers have
  already paid for,” said Lindsey. “This administration is trying to hide it and
  take it away from us. It’s an abuse of government. It’s a waste of resources.
  People should be indignant. That’s not the way the government should work.” “I
  think it’s important for this initiative to persist even past this
  crowdfunding phase,” said another part-time contributor to the project, who
  wished to remain anonymous because they are still an employee of the federal
  government. “Whether people realize it or not, climate change impacts
  everyone, regardless of the current political environment. And climate science
  is the only way to understand and adapt to what is happening on our big
  beautiful planet.”
