  ‘Really transitional moment’: what should we do about declining fertility
  rates?

  “We happen to be alive at this really transitional moment,” said Prof Jane
  Falkingham, the director of the Centre for Population Change at the University
  of Southampton. “We’re moving from a world with high fertility and high
  mortality to a world of low mortality and low fertility. We have to get our
  heads around how we’re going to make that transition from the old world to the
  new world.” Earlier this week, figures from the Office for National Statistics
  showed the fertility rate for England and Wales had fallen for the third year
  in a row to reach a record low of 1.41. The rate represents the average number
  of live children women can expect to have in their child-bearing life. The
  figures are part of a long-term trend of declining fertility rates across much
  of the globe – and experts are still working out exactly what the
  repercussions will be for our society and economy. “We’re going to have an
  ageing population, so we need to think about the ages we start work, the ages
  we finish work, and how we organise the life course,” said Falkingham. “These
  are a lot of big policy challenges and we’ll have to think through what the
  solutions will be.” Some of the effects are already being felt, with schools
  in some parts of the UK closing or merging due to declining pupil numbers, and
  the sector expected to lose £1bn in funding by 2030. In June it was announced
  that five primary schools in Westminster, central London, would be merged to
  two, after they reported declining pupil numbers, put down to housing costs
  and falling birthrates. Paul Morland, a demographer and the author of No One
  Left: Why the World Needs More Children, said the sharp decline in fertility
  rates meant that “instead of just steadily building up the problem for the
  future, we’re dramatically building up the problem for the future”. “You’ll
  start seeing that in schools closing. And what that means is in 20 years’
  time, we will have a smaller and smaller number of people of working age.
  That’s going to make the public finances impossible, and the welfare state
  unsustainable,” he said. Dr Rebecca Montacute, the research director at the
  Social Market Foundation, a cross-party thinktank, said declining fertility
  rates caused “major economic challenge” in the long term. “You simply will
  have fewer people of working age who are able to pay taxes and then actually
  pay for all of the goods and services that we need in the wider economy. At
  the same time, you have more ageing people, and they have obviously a heavy
  cost to the state in terms of the health and social care they need,” she said.
  This would leave government with a “stark choice” between reducing public
  services or bringing in younger workers from abroad, both of which were
  politically challenging, she said. However, there are many who say a declining
  fertility rate is no cause for alarm, and will actually bring environmental
  and economic benefits due to less consumption and demand for resources. Dr
  Joshua Hill, the chief research and operations officer at the charity
  Population Matters, said: “Tackling biodiversity loss, like rewilding, is
  easier to do with a lower population, and it also leads to a reduction in
  pollution and waste. “For the UK, having a smaller population makes everything
  easier. It increases our food security. Health crises become lower. We are a
  small nation with a high population density. Everything is scarce,
  relatively.” The UK population is predicted to grow to 86 million by 2100,
  fuelled by net migration (without migration, it is modelled to fall to 48
  million), so Hill argues there is little concern about a declining workforce
  in the short term. He said the advent of artificial intelligence could lead to
  a reduced demand for workers anyway. “I think actually the reality is that
  joblessness is going to be a far bigger problem than having not enough
  people,” he said. There is, however, concern about who will care for our
  ageing population, and whether our current social care system has the
  resources to cope, particularly when unpaid, informal support networks – often
  created by children or younger relatives – are not there. “The cohort of women
  born in the 1960s, around 20% of them didn’t have children, so when they move
  into their 70s, 80s and 90s, we’re going to see more of a focus on the funding
  of social care,” said Falkingham. But she said this would probably lead to the
  emergence of different models of care, such as through friendship groups, or a
  greater reliance on technology. Japan, for instance, is starting to roll out
  home-care robots to help look after its ageing population. But Japan should
  also act a warning for what could come in the future, Morland said. “People
  say Japan is not falling to pieces, and that’s true. But it has got massive
  debt and its innovation and creativity has gone down and down. So it
  definitely suggests long-term decline, whether that’s government debt or the
  number of patents,” he said. Japan has also seen an epidemic of lonely deaths,
  with 68,000 people expected to die alone and unnoticed this year, the majority
  of them over 65. “There is a risk that a lot of older people will be left
  uncared for,” Morland said. “There’s a lot of dependence of older people on
  their children, and they just won’t be there to do it. We have three workers
  for every retiree where we used to have four, five or six, and that’s putting
  huge pressure on the state.”
