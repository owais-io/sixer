  Botswana’s president has declared a public health emergency due to shortages
  of essential medicines and equipment, as a downturn in the global diamond
  market and US aid cuts take a toll on the country’s finances. The announcement
  came after the Ministry of Health suspended non-urgent surgeries on 4 August,
  stating that the country was short of medicines to treat hypertension,
  diabetes, cancer, asthma and eye conditions, as well as supplies including
  bandages and sutures and those for sexual and reproductive health. The
  president, Duma Boko, said in a televised address on Monday night that the
  country’s medical supply chain had failed, as he announced 250m pula (£13.8m)
  in funding for emergency medicines, the distribution of which would be
  overseen by the military. Boko blamed the state procurement agency Central
  Medical Stores (CMS), which he said in turn blamed intermediaries, for
  ratcheting up drug prices in the southern African country, which has a
  population of about 2.5 million and is the world’s largest diamond producer by
  value. He said: “The current prices often are inflated five to 10 times. And
  under the current economic conditions, this scenario is not sustainable.”
  Boko, who defeated the party that had been in power for six decades in
  elections last October, said the CMS had quoted 705m pula for a year’s worth
  of the medicines that Botswana needed. Meanwhile, a new emergency taskforce
  received a quote of less than 80m pula. Thabo Lucas Seleke, a University of
  Botswana lecturer, said the CMS was plagued by dysfunction, inertia, unmet
  reform pledges and corruption allegations, adding: “There have been yearly
  reports from the auditor general, which … flagged incomplete procurement
  records, missing contracts and recurrent delivery delays.” Also feeding into
  the problem is the dire state of Botswana’s economy and public finances, which
  contributed to Boko’s victory last year. There is no end in sight for the
  three-year downturn in the price of diamonds, which in 2024 accounted for
  about a quarter of Botswana’s GDP, one-third of government revenues and 80% of
  exports, according to the International Monetary Fund. The economy shrank by
  an estimated 3% in 2024. Zoë McCathie, an analyst at the consultancy Signal
  Risk, said: “The diamond downturn has been a lot more sustained than diamond
  mining companies and the state itself had initially predicted. As a result,
  the state was not as prepared for this as it could have been.” The Ministry of
  Health, in its 4 August statement, said it owed 1bn pula to “private health
  facilities and supplies, amongst others”. Botswana is a world leader in
  tackling HIV/Aids. In 2000, one in eight children were born with HIV. In 2023,
  it was fewer than 100. Earlier this year, it became the first country with a
  high HIV-positive population to be awarded the World Health Organization’s
  gold-tier status for eliminating mother-to-child – or “vertical” – HIV
  transmission as a public health threat. However, while Botswana buys its own
  antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV, it has also been hit by US aid cuts
  announced in January. Before the cuts, the US funded about one-third of the
  country’s HIV response, according to UNAids – $55m (£41m) annually from the US
  president’s emergency plan for Aids relief (Pepfar) and $12m via the Global
  Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Some, but not all, global Pepfar
  funding has since been restored.
