  The traditional post-summer rentrée feels almost incomplete without an
  accompanying political crisis in France. And right on cue this year’s return
  from les grandes vacances has delivered – but in the form of a shock move that
  could collapse the government within a fortnight, plunging Europe’s second
  biggest economy into chaos. Prime minister François Bayrou stunned the country
  on Monday by announcing he would seek a “back me or sack me” confidence vote
  in the national assembly on 8 September. For a minority prime minister, it is
  a risky gamble indeed – he has almost no chance of winning the vote, wrote
  Angelique Chrisafis, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent. France is now bracing
  for political paralysis or destabilisation – as well as its debt crisis – at a
  time when geopolitical demands are intensifying: the war in Ukraine and
  Russia’s threat to Europe’s security; EU/US trade tensions and an escalating
  row with the Trump administration over France’s expected recognition of
  Palestine. As the EU’s biggest military power, France is co-leader of the
  western coalition that could potentially send troops to Ukraine in the event
  of a peace deal. Yet President Macron’s international focus may soon have to
  switch to the domestic search for a new prime minister. Bayrou, appointed by
  Macron just nine months ago, vowed on Tuesday to “fight like a dog” to remain
  in power. But the parliamentary arithmetic is stacked against him, with
  opposition parties on the far right and the left already declaring they will
  vote against him. The PM’s troubles escalated after he outlined proposals for
  a budgetary freeze in 2026 and the abolition of two public holidays, a plan
  that drew howls of outrage from all sides. Bayrou says austerity is imperative
  because France is broke and on the cusp of a “national emergency” over its
  deficit and debt. By now putting his own job on the line he appears to be
  daring political opponents on the far right and left to press the nuclear
  button – hoping they won’t want the blame for the ensuing upheaval with France
  already facing pressure on the bond markets. The timing suggests he is also
  hoping to outmanoeuvre the anonymous organisers of “Bloquons Tout”, a
  grassroots campaign that is threatening to bring the country to a standstill
  with nationwide anti-cuts protests on 10 September. Either way, Bayrou’s days
  in the Matignon appear to be numbered. Angelique pointed out that the veteran
  politician recently achieved the distinction of becoming the most unpopular
  French prime minister since the start of the Fifth Republic in 1958. A snap
  poll for the French TV channel TF1 published Wednesdsay morning showed that
  63% are in favour of dissolving parliament – in other words, fresh elections –
  and 68% think Macron should resign if an election perpetuated the current
  parliamentary gridlock. Paul Taylor, a France-based Guardian opinion
  contributor and senior visiting fellow with the European Policy Centre, says
  Bayrou’s calculus is that if the vote is purely on the fiscal crisis and the
  need to take drastic measures to reduce the debt mountain, enough opposition
  MPs will abstain and the government will survive with enhanced legitimacy.
  “But it doesn’t look as if either the political class or the public are buying
  Bayrou’s argument that France is on the brink of a debt crisis,” he noted.
  Bayrou was appointed after his predecessor, Michel Barnier, was ousted after
  using special powers to force through spending cuts after just three months in
  the role. Because of the size of the French economy, the uncertainty is a
  concern for the eurozone more broadly. The Paris stock market tumbled after
  Bayrou’s announcement, shares in French banks slid and borrowing costs have
  risen. Peace in Ukraine? Talks between Kyiv and its western allies on
  “security guarantees” for a postwar Ukraine are said to be making progress,
  even if the bigger picture suggests that Donald Trump’s peace initiative is
  going nowhere. Vladimir Putin has hardened his stance since his red-carpet
  summit with Trump in Alaska, wrote Pjotr Sauer, the Guardian’s Russia affairs
  reporter. Moscow is flatly rejecting the prospect of troops from countries in
  Europe being positioned in Ukraine. Donald Trump has also ruled out US “boots
  on the ground” in Ukraine, offering only a vague, undefined US coordinating
  role. This means that despite the upbeat mood after last week’s Washington
  summit, where Macron and other European leaders flanked President Zelenskyy,
  the realisation is sinking in, wrote Paul Taylor, that Europe is on its own in
  defending Ukraine and hence its own security against Russian aggression. There
  is anger but little surprise in Donetsk, from where Dan Sabbagh sent this
  vivid dispatch, at the lack of a breakthrough. Putin apparently demanded the
  industrial region’s handover during the Alaska summit. As Ukraine prepared to
  mark 34 years of independence from the Soviet Union last weekend, the
  Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov articulated the Ukrainian fear that peace
  remains “a distant dream”. He writes: “Trump’s peace plans once again have
  turned out to be an illusion, and the only person who has not yet realised
  this is the US president.” Thanks for reading: you can find a curation from
