  Gusts of more than 100mph from Storm Floris have brought travel disruption,
  power cuts and the widespread cancellation of events across large parts of the
  UK. Central and northern Scotland was the area most affected on Monday,
  causing the kind of problems normally seen on a stormy winter’s day. Met
  Office data showed a gust of 134mph was recorded at the summit of Cairn Gorm
  in the Highlands, 1,245 metres above sea level. The strongest gust away from
  mountains was 80mph at South Uist. Storm Floris was the UK’s sixth named storm
  of the 2024-25 season and the first since Storm Éowyn in January. Its arrival
  led to an amber weather warning across much of Scotland, with police advising
  against unnecessary travel. The alert, which warns of there being a danger to
  life, is in place until 11pm on Monday. A yellow weather warning was in place
  across southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, parts of north Wales and northern
  England. It warned of “unseasonably strong and potentially disruptive winds”
  until midnight. Rail travel was severely disrupted, with LNER telling
  passengers not to travel north of Newcastle. Avanti West Coast advised people
  not to travel north of Preston. ScotRail said there would be a blanket 50mph
  speed restriction and many services stopped at midday. Posting on social
  media, the rail operator asked people who lived near railway lines to tie down
  garden furniture and trampolines because of the danger of them blowing on to
  tracks. Disruption to the rail network in Scotland will probably continue into
  Tuesday, passengers have been warned. Network Rail said it was working
  tirelessly to clear routes blocked by falling trees and debris but some checks
  will need to be carried out on Tuesday morning. The Forth Bridge was closed to
  doubledecker buses, motorcyclists and pedestrians and many other bridges were
  closed to high-sided vehicles. In Newcastle, the Tyne Bridge was closed to all
  traffic because of the wind. A number of campervans were blown over on the A87
  road, which leads to Portree on the Isle of Skye. The aviation analytics
  company Cirium said 68 flights from UK airports on Monday were cancelled
  including 12 at Aberdeen, the worst-affected airport. Monday’s performance of
  the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo was cancelled, the first time in its
  75-year history that it had not gone ahead because of the weather. A swathe of
  Edinburgh festival fringe events were also cancelled, with the Pleasance
  Courtyard and the Pleasance Plaza both closed until 6pm. Edinburgh zoo closed
  at lunchtime because of the escalating wind speed. School pupils in Orkney,
  Shetland and the Western Isles were warned that the delivery of some exam
  results, expected on Tuesday, would be delayed. Floris is the strongest named
  storm to have occurred in the month of August. Since the naming process was
  started in 2015, there have been five named storms in August. The Met Office
  forecaster Peter Sloss told BBC Radio Scotland it represented “uncharted
  territory”. Dr Jess Neumann, an associate professor of hydrology at the
  University of Reading, said summer storms came with added dangers. She said:
  “There is a potential danger to life as Storm Floris is due to hit during peak
  summer holiday time when people may be travelling or visiting unfamiliar
  places outside of their usual area. When the unexpected hits, that’s when
  people are the least prepared and most at risk.” Lorna Slater, the Scottish
  Green co-leader, said the storm showed the need for urgent action to tackle
  the climate crisis. Slater said: “We should not be seeing storms like this in
  August, but with climate chaos around us these kinds of scenes will only
  become more common and more severe.” There were reports of fallen trees on
  roads and rail lines across the affected area as well as power cuts in
  Northern Ireland, Scotland and northern England. Scottish and Southern
  Electricity Networks (SSEN) said it was working to restore power to 22,500
  properties in the Highlands and north-east Scotland, with more cuts expected
  later in the day. Not everyone would be reconnected by the end of the day, the
  company said. SSEN’s director of customer operations, Andy Smith, said Floris
  was the strongest summer storm it had seen in a very long time. “At the height
  of summer, we’ve mounted an operation that’s comparable in size to the ones we
  mobilise when a storm hits during the depths of winter,” he said. The Met
  Office’s chief meteorologist, Matthew Lehnert, said: “Winds will first ease in
  the west during later Monday but remaining very strong overnight until early
  Tuesday in the east. Heavy rain may also contribute to the disruption in
  places.”
