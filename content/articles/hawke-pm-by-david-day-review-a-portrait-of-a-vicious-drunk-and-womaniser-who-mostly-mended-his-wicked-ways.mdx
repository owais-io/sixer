  mostly mended his wicked ways

  The second instalment of David Day’s biography of Bob Hawke, which chronicles
  the public and private lives of Labor’s longest-serving prime minister, is as
  masterful, gritty and in many ways as disturbing as the first. The first,
  Young Hawke: The Making of a Larrikin, traced his life from birth through his
  unconventional upbringing, student days in Australia and Oxford, and his rise
  as a unionist amid eventual national expectation he’d one day become prime
  minister. A portrait emerged of an unlikeable and perhaps pathological
  narcissist, a vicious drunk who apparently loved many women, including his
  long-suffering wife Hazel, while he was borderline predatory with others. The
  parallel story traced his rise as a worker’s hero and a friend to bosses, a
  peacemaker and king of consensus who made remarkable gains for ordinary
  Australians. For a long time Hawke carried with him through public life a
  broad assumption he’d become PM. For Hawke, personally, it was fated. But he
  and his most assiduous supporters knew that even as Australia’s most
  celebrated “larrikin” (a catch-all, that, for blackout pisshead, lousy dad,
  worse husband and occasional sleaze) he would have to mend his wicked ways. At
  least for public consumption. Hawke was self-aware enough to understand this
  as he entered parliament and immediately set about building his profile as a
  team-playing caucus member – all the while enjoying stratospheric political
  popularity and stalking Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The Hawke marriage was
  pretty much over, except in name, when he entered parliament in 1980. He was
  still drinking heavily and found his lower-profile life on the backbench
  challenging. But to the amazement of many peers, he quit the booze and began
  to lead a more discreet personal life in his quest for prime ministership – a
  job he retained for a Labor record of almost nine years. Quitting drink was
  not easy for one whose public wheels had been oiled by grog for more than
  three decades. But it was as critical to his ascent as a strategy to publicly
  air some of the worst aspects of his past through Blanche d’Alpuget’s 1982
  biography, Robert J Hawke. Both decisions helped him become electorally
  presentable. (D’Alpuget, of course, became Hawke’s second wife after his
  political departure when Paul Keating rose, just as inevitably, and knocked
  him off as PM in December 1991.) This public inoculation was a high-risk
  strategy that seems to have worked. As Day writes: “The fact that the
  biography was written by an excellent writer who also happened to be his
  lover, and that it was vetted by him and Hazel, would have given him some
  confidence about its likely reception. Moreover, as a narcissist, he expected
  to be forgiven and embraced whatever he did.’’ Those who’ve worked anywhere
  near politics understand its terrible toll on families; the effect on Hawke’s
  was devastating. There is a poignancy to how Day writes about the familial
  collateral on Hazel and their three children, Sue, Rosslyn and Stephen. When
  Hawke was mustering support against Hayden he needed Victorian power broker
  Bill Landeryou’s backing. His daughter Rosslyn, then 21, had been working for
  Landeryou – a favour from the power broker “in the hope of distancing her from
  the Sydney drug culture’’ she’d become immersed in. When Rosslyn alleged to
  her father that Landeryou had raped her, Day recounts how Hawke urged her not
  to go to the police so as to avoid controversy while he sought the Labor
  leadership. “In convincing his daughter not to complain to the police, Hawke
  would have doubtless consoled himself that he was also protecting her, since
  any prosecution would have seen her … heroin use become the stuff of lurid
  headlines at a time when rapists were rarely convicted,” Day writes. The Hawke
  marriage continued as a partnership throughout his prime ministership during
  which he oversaw (with Keating’s critical support as treasurer and as his
  sharpest parliamentary advocate) unprecedented social and economic reforms,
  not least the prices and incomes accord, the introduction of universal
  healthcare, compulsory superannuation and floating of the Australian dollar.
  Lagging badly in the polls in late 1990 and his government adrift with Keating
  now on the backbench after his failed first leadership challenge, Liberal
  leader John Hewson released his Fightback manifesto with its centrepiece goods
  and services tax. Whereas Keating would have demolished Fightback, publicly
  and in parliament, a “transfixed’’ Hawke was a “rabbit in the headlights”.
  This was, Day concludes, Hawke’s undoing. Those of us who grew up watching
  Hawke ascend, who voted for him in 1983 and benefited from his progressive new
  Australia won’t regret it when they read this book. But they will understand a
  lot more about the man’s fabric. Hawke PM: The Making of a Legend by David Day
  is out now (HarperCollins Australia, $49.99)
