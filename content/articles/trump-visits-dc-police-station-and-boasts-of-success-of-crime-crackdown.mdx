  Donald Trump told law enforcement officials that his administration will buy
  new grass for parks in Washington DC so they resemble his golf courses, during
  his visit to a US park police facility on Thursday – an event ostensibly
  scheduled to tout his crackdown on crime in the city. The president had
  indicated earlier in the day he would join police and national guard troops on
  something resembling a patrol, but his remarks at park police’s Anacostia
  station was his lone stop on his excursion from the White House. Flanked by
  secretary for homeland security Kristi Noem, attorney general Pam Bondi and
  interior secretary Doug Bergum, Trump declared his takeover of the
  Metropolitan police department to be a success because people were eating out
  again, despite restaurants reporting a drop in reservations. Trump also vowed
  that his administration would lay down new grass in DC’s parks and green
  spaces, as part of a wider ambition to clean up the nation’s capital. “One of
  the things we are going to be redoing is your parks. I’m very good at grass,
  because I have a lot of golf courses all over the place. I know more about
  grass than any human being I think anywhere in the world,” Trump told the
  officers. “And we are going to be re-grassing all of your parks, all brand-new
  sprinkler systems, the best that you can buy. Just like Augusta. It’ll look
  like Augusta. It will look like, more importantly, Trump national golf club,
  that’s even better,” he said, comparing his own golf course in Virginia to the
  venue for the Masters. “We’re going to have all brand-new, beautiful grass.
  You know, like everything else, grass has a life. Do you know that? Grass has
  a life. You know, we have a life, and grass has a life. And the grass here
  died about 40 years ago,” Trump added. The freewheeling remarks from Trump
  also touched several other topics unrelated to DC crime, and he basked in his
  recent legal victory after a New York state appeals court threw out a $500m
  judgement against him in the civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney
  general, Letitia James, in 2022. The excursion came a day after JD Vance,
  defense secretary Pete Hegseth and Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen
  Miller, visited national guard troops posted at Union Station and pledged to
  expand the crackdown. The group’s impromptu stop at a Shake Shack in Union
  Station drew boos, insults and epithets that echoed around the cavernous
  entrance hall of the beaux arts-style train station. Trump has long complained
  about perceived crime rates in DC and the declaration gave him an opening to
  invoke a legal justification to bring the Metropolitan police department under
  his administration’s control and deploy national guard troops from several
  states. Falsely painting DC as an urban hellscape overrun by “bloodthirsty
  criminals”, Trump authorized the deployment of law enforcement units across
  the city – both in areas with high rates of recorded crime, as well as popular
  nightlife and tourist spots, including near the White House and Union Station.
  Since then, the White House has also tied its immigration enforcement agenda
  to reducing crime in DC, deploying US Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) agents and other federal law enforcement on local patrols to detain
  immigrants in traffic stops. The surge of law enforcement agents has
  corresponded to a higher number of daily arrests, which the administration has
  used to argue Trump’s move was reducing the number of undocumented immigrants
  and take credit for bringing down crimes such as carjackings and shootings.
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday morning, DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, said the
  city had previously had drops in violent crime before the Trump administration
  took the police department over and added an order from the US attorney
  general, Pam Bondi, compelling DC police to cooperate with federal officials
  focused on immigration and homeless enforcement.
