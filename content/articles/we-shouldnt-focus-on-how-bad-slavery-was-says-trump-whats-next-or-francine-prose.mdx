  Donald Trump’s critique of the Smithsonian Institution for its focus on “how
  bad slavery was” might seem like a joke, except that, like so many of the
  ignorant, mean-spirited and flat-out racist opinions and directives issued by
  the White House over the last six months, it’s not even remotely funny. What
  makes it even more absurd and disturbing is that the president and his minions
  (JD Vance, the vice-president, sits on the Smithsonian’s board) are determined
  to micro-manage the exhibits and wall texts on view at the 21 museums that
  operate under the Smithsonian’s aegis and to replace the truth about history
  with “unifying and constructive descriptions”. Among the proscribed images are
  a picture of the former NIAID director Dr Anthony Fauci (one of the
  president’s perceived enemies) and a photo of immigrants watching fireworks
  through a gap in the border wall. Apparently, the purpose of removing programs
  that “degrade shared American values, divide Americans by race or promote
  ideologies inconsistent with federal law” is to present the American past as
  an unblemished landscape of positivity and perfection, to pretend that nothing
  wrong – let alone evil – has been done on our shores since our nation’s
  founding. The point is to create a national identity that mirrors the
  president’s own view of himself as a model of moral purity, an angelic being
  who has never made a mistake that merits an apology or even a moment of
  regret. If white America has never harmed, disenfranchised, enslaved and
  slaughtered our Black and Indigenous American populations, then clearly
  there’s no reason to take the measures – such as the establishment of DEI
  programs – designed to remedy the inequities and cruelties that the powerful
  have inflicted on the weak. Like many “ideas” that have been issued from the
  Oval Office, this one doesn’t seem to have been thought through with any
  clarity or even common sense. Even the most diehard Maga supporters would
  probably agree that slavery is, by definition, “bad”. It’s not a delusional
  fantasy of woke ideologues to suggest that it’s wrong to whip and shackle, to
  buy and sell our fellow human beings. Consequently, the only way to avoid
  making slavery look “bad” is not to mention it at all, not to admit that it
  ever existed, not to acknowledge that from our country’s inception to the end
  of the civil war, this crime against humanity was perfectly legal. Presumably,
  the history of the civil rights movement – the image of George Wallace, the
  Alabama governor, setting his attack dogs loose on Black demonstrators is
  another “bad” look for America – will also be erased from the museum walls.
  Why would we need to learn about the courage it took to desegregate schools
  and lunch counters when we have effectively censored the fact that they were
  ever segregated at all? To whitewash (pun intended) history, to prevent
  students and museumgoers from learning the truth is not only a grave insult to
  Black and Indigenous Americans but a problem for us all. Because the fact is
  that the past explains the present, and without history, there’s no way of
  understanding how we arrived at the current moment. Students whose teachers
  hope to supplement their education with a trip to the Smithsonian will leave
  the museum understandably perplexed. Does Donald Trump want them to conclude
  that the majority of Black people traveled to our shores, first class, on the
  ship that brought his ancestors here from Bavaria? If there was no slavery,
  why was the civil war fought? Did Indigenous Americans elect to have their
  land stolen, to be massacred and forced on to reservations, to see their
  children taken away and sent to harsh and punitive boarding schools? In my
  experience, people in general – and children in particular – know when they
  are being lied to. More than likely, kids will sense that something about the
  museum exhibit they just saw doesn’t add up, that an essential part of the
  story has been left out. But maybe that’s really the point. The attack on
  museums, like the assault on education, is meant to convince us that the truth
  doesn’t matter, that there is no truth, that the wisest course is to blindly
  accept and repeat whatever lies an authoritarian government chooses to tell.
  There’s some disagreement about who first said: “Those who cannot remember the
  past are doomed to repeat it.” Some claim it was Winston Churchill, others
  attribute it to George Santayana. But does anyone doubt its veracity? Perhaps
  the most nightmarish explanation is that our current administration actually
  wants us to repeat the most loathsome events of our common past – and to be
  assured that every act of brutality will disappear from our collective
  consciousness. There’s a terrifying kind of freedom in knowing that our most
  odious deeds will be erased from our historical memory, that what we do now
  will have no consequences – indeed, no reality – in the years to come.
  According to the “historically accurate” museum exhibits and history books of
  the future, there will have been no slavery, there was no discrimination,
  there were no massacres of our Indigenous population. There was never a time
  when hard-working, law-abiding immigrant families were separated, when yet
  more children were stolen from their parents, when, according to the current
  estimate, 80,000 people – most of them entirely innocent – were imprisoned,
  when thousands more were kidnapped off the streets and deported from a country
  they had labored so hard to benefit. And none of this will be mentioned, none
  of this can be said or written on a wall text, lest we allow the unpatriotic
  ideologues to make America look bad. Francine Prose is a former president of
