  The Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to hobble the international
  criminal court in what the ICC has denounced as a “flagrant attack against the
  independence of an impartial judicial institution”. The US state department on
  Wednesday announced new sanctions on four ICC officials, including two judges
  and two prosecutors, saying they had been instrumental in efforts to prosecute
  Americans and Israelis. As a result of the sanctions, any assets that the
  targets hold in US jurisdictions are frozen. The sanctions were immediately
  denounced by both the ICC and the United Nations, while Israel welcomed the
  move announced by the secretary of state, Marco Rubio. It is just the latest
  in a series of steps the Trump administration has taken against the
  Hague-based court, the world’s first international war crimes tribunal. The
  US, which is not a member of the court, has already imposed penalties on the
  ICC’s former chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, who stepped aside in May pending an
  investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, and four other tribunal
  judges. The new penalties target the ICC judges Kimberly Prost of Canada and
  Nicolas Guillou of France and prosecutors Nazhat Shameem Khan of Fiji and Mame
  Mandiaye Niang of Senegal. “These individuals are foreign persons who directly
  engaged in efforts by the international criminal court to investigate, arrest,
  detain or prosecute nationals of the United States or Israel, without the
  consent of either nation,” Rubio said. He added that the administration would
  continue “to take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our troops,
  our sovereignty and our allies from the ICC’s illegitimate and baseless
  actions”. In a separate statement, the state department said Prost was
  sanctioned for a ruling to authorize an ICC investigation into personnel in
  Afghanistan, which was later dropped. Guillou was sanctioned for ruling to
  authorize the ICC’s issuance of arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and
  Israel’s former minister of defense Yoav Gallant related to Israel’s war in
  Gaza. France – whose president, Emmanuel Macron, was in Washington two days
  earlier – expressed “dismay” over the action. The sanctions are “in
  contradiction to the principle of an independent judiciary”, a foreign
  ministry spokesperson said in Paris. Khan and Niang were penalized for
  continuing Karim Khan’s investigation into Israel’s actions in Gaza, including
  upholding the ICC’s arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, according to
  the statement. In response, the ICC issued a statement calling the sanctions
  “a flagrant attack against the independence of an impartial judicial
  institution” and “an affront against the Court’s states parties, the
  rules-based international order and, above all, millions of innocent victims
  across the world”. A UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said the ICC had the
  full support of the world body to carry out its work. The UN was “very
  concerned” about the US continuing to target the international court, he said.
  “We firmly believe that the ICC is a key pillar of international criminal
  justice, and we respect their work,” Dujarric said. “The decision imposes
  severe impediments on the functioning of the office of the prosecutor in
  respect for all the situations that are currently before the court.” Netanyahu
  welcomed the US move. “This is a firm measure against the mendacious smear
  campaign against the State of Israel and the IDF, and for truth and justice,”
  he said in a statement, using an acronym for the Israeli military. Wednesday’s
  move carries on a history of Trump administration actions against the ICC
  dating back to his first term in office. During Trump’s first term, the US hit
  the ICC with sanctions, but those were rescinded by Joe Biden’s administration
  in early 2021. Danya Chaikel, the International Federation for Human Rights’s
  representative to the ICC, said the escalation in US sanctions amounted to “a
  continued attack on the rule of law and a blatant attempt to intimidate those
  pursuing accountability for atrocity crimes”. She said the new sanctions were
  a “defining test” for the ICC’s 125 member states. “Will they defend the
  court’s independence and the rights of victims of international crimes, or
  allow intimidation by powerful states to dictate who deserves justice?” she
  added.
