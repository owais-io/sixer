  Good afternoon. A powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever
  recorded, has triggered a series of tsunami warnings and evacuation orders
  stretching across Japan, the US west coast and parts of the Pacific. The
  shallow quake hit near Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula on Wednesday, with reports
  of waves up to 4 metres high in the remote region. Japan issued evacuation
  warnings and the country’s weather agency said the first waves measuring 30cm
  had reached the eastern coast of Hokkaido. In the US, tsunami waves had hit
  the state of Hawaii, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said, warning
  that urgent action should be taken to protect lives and property. A tsunami
  warning was also issued for parts of the Alaska Aleutian Islands, and a watch
  for portions of the US west coast. The PTWC included Australia in its
  advisory, saying waves of 0.3 to 1 metre were possible along the coast, though
  the Bureau of Meteorology says there is currently no tsunami threat. Follow
