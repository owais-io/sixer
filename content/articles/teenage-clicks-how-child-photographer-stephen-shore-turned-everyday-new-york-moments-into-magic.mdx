  Black-and-white street shots of elegant, unimpressed elderly women. Classic
  cars in shadows cast by New York’s soaring tenement buildings. Street-corner
  preachers. Imposing wiseguys too busy posturing to notice the camera. Stephen
  Shore’s new book, Early Work, is full of such everyday New York moments turned
  into magic. Though he later won acclaim for the photographs he took at Andy
  Warhol’s studio/hangout the Factory, the previously unseen Early Work may be
  some of Shore’s most uninhibited and daring pictures – and they were taken in
  the early 60s, when he was a teenager. Perhaps it’s understandable, then, that
  the photographer, now 77, can’t really remember taking them – though he does
  recall that he printed them himself, in a DIY darkroom set up in the bathroom
  of his parents’ home on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. “The memory of the prints
  I made then is hard to separate from the memory of the actual event of taking
  the photograph,” he admits over the phone. “I don’t remember what was on my
  mind then, but what I see looking at them now is a kind of formal awareness,
  which I guess I understood intuitively. I understood from the beginning that a
  camera doesn’t point, it frames. I also understood the gap between the world
  of the photograph and the world we experience – the world of the photograph
  has to make sense on its own, out of context.” He does remember how he took a
  series of shots from an unusual high angle, a kind of giant’s eye view of
  passersby – as if the voracious young photographer were trying to grasp his
  home city from every possible perspective, to make himself big enough to
  understand it. “I put a very wide-angle lens on my Leica and held the camera
  over my head and took pictures randomly.” The idea for Early Work came after
  Shore returned from Rhinebeck Village in upstate New York, whereupon his
  studio manager Laura Steele presented him with a stack of prints made from his
  archive. The picture on top depicted Shore’s parents standing on a street
  corner – in Rhinebeck. Though Shore has lived nearby since the early 1980s, “I
  had no idea I had been there before.” The picture appears on the back cover of
  the book and is the one in the collection Shore is most attached to. Aside
  from sentimental reasons, it prefigures the formal concerns he would explore
  aged 23, when he travelled across the US with an 8x10 camera, taking the
  photographs that appear in his lauded book Uncommon Places, an expansive
  portrait of America’s diners, gas stations and national parks. Looking through
  Early Work, it is remarkable how uninterested Shore seems to be in people his
  own age. Most of his subjects are over 40. Their generation, he points out,
  had lived through the Great Depression and the second world war – many were
  veterans trying to return to regular life in the city. The pictures suggest a
  reverence and respect for their authority, though Shore can’t remember whether
  he was feeling this when he took them. “I see a photographer observing the
  people and the city, observing their inner state, how they interact, looking
  at social and cultural meanings,” he says. “People who are drawn to the medium
  of translating the world into an image tend to be fascinated by the world.”
  Shore’s documentation of 1960s New York inevitably reveals how social habits
  have changed over the decades. “The city is crowded now, but people don’t hang
  out in the same way,” he says. “People were out on the street experiencing
  each other, engaging with each other and feeling free to roam the city, not
  scrolling through TikTok.” The pictures also convey a sense of liberation
  perhaps less accessible to New York kids today. “Parents were not as
  protective and determining of their children’s activities,” Shore says. “When
  I was eight and living in Manhattan, I went to school downtown alone on two
  different buses. That was typical in the 1960s.” It was Shore’s uncle Leo who
  introduced him to photography. Recognising his nephew’s nascent interest in
  chemistry, he gave Shore a Kodak ABC Darkroom Outfit as a sixth birthday
  present – a simple kit for making contact prints at home, complete with
  developing trays and chemicals. By 1962, the 14-year-old Shore had signed up
  to take photography classes at New York’s New School, where he studied briefly
  under the great Austrian American photographer Lisette Model – whose influence
  can be seen in the confrontational approach and bold attitude of some of
  Shore’s shots of people on the street. He became involved in a photography
  community who would get together once a month to critique each other’s work.
  “You’d get a little slip of paper in an envelope with a time and date for the
  meeting,” he remembers. “It was like a secret society – except we didn’t have
  any pretensions to exclusivity.” Photography was hardly ever exhibited at
  museums or galleries at the time: “There was absolutely no notoriety involved
  in being a photographer, there was no remuneration, pictures sold for nothing
  – if they sold. Some people are drawn to the medium without any possibility of
  fame or fortune.” MoMA was one of the few New York art institutions to take
  photography seriously enough to have a curator dedicated to it, Edward
  Steichen, and at 14 Shore called him up, which led to MoMA acquiring three of
  Shore’s photographs. In 1971, Shore became the first living photographer to
  have a solo exhibition at the Met. Despite being awarded two prestigious
  fellowships in 1975 and a subsequent solo show at MoMA the following year, his
  pictures sold for as little as $125 each. Shore got by financially thanks to
  teaching – he has been the director of the photography department at Bard
  College, New York, since 1982. “I’ve taught every generation from X to Z.”
  Early Work ends with pictures Shore took on his very first day at the Factory.
  He and Warhol had met at a screening where the latter premiered his
  underground movie The Life of Juanita Castro and Shore presented a 16mm film,
  Elevator. He would spend three years photographing the Factory almost daily,
  capturing “superstars” such as Edie Sedgwick, its house band the Velvet
  Underground, and the groundbreaking work its impresario was making. Warhol,
  Store says, “was always friendly and direct. He was 20 years my senior and
  would, if I said something inappropriate in a situation, correct me, somewhat
  like an older relative giving guidance, but otherwise he treated me as a
  friend.” As Shore was the only other person in the group who lived on the
  Upper East Side, “when we broke up for the evening, perhaps two in the morning
  after a late supper in Little Italy or Chinatown, Andy and I would share a
  taxi uptown. We had totally unguarded conversations.” Many of the Factory
  regulars were gay, as was Warhol, but “he understood that I was straight – and
  this was never an issue”. While Shore got unprecedented access to the Factory,
  the pictures he took there lack the expansive experimentation and lucidity of
  Shore’s street shots. You can sense the photographer, still only a teenager,
  feeling his way into a new world. In his 20s, Shore would become one of the
  defining photographers of postwar America, but Early Work shows that his
  ability to articulate the mood of his country in images was present right from
  the start. “Painters start with a blank canvas and make marks to add
  complexity; photography is the opposite – you start with the whole world,” he
  says. “I don’t know what to do with a blank paper – but put me on a street
  corner and my imagination goes off!” • Stephen Shore: Early Work is published
