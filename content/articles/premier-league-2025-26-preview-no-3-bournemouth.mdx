  Guardian writers’ predicted position: 10th (NB: this is not necessarily Ben
  Fisher’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s
  position: 9th Prospects Three months ago, Bournemouth won at Arsenal for the
  first time to maintain their hopes of qualifying for Europe with three games
  to go. It was an impressive comeback victory built on set pieces, Dean Huijsen
  heading the equaliser from Antoine Semenyo’s long throw – cue the Chill Guy
  meme celebration – before Evanilson poked in a scruffy but well-worked winner
  from a corner. Bournemouth came up short in their quest to play in Europe as a
  positive season fizzled out after three wins from their final 15 matches. And
  now three of their back five from that day have departed – Huijsen for Real
  Madrid, Milos Kerkez for Liverpool and Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was on loan from
  Chelsea, for Arsenal. The expectation is that Illia Zabarnyi will become the
  next high-profile exit, with Paris Saint-Germain pushing to sign the
  22-year-old. The fact Bournemouth sold Huijsen to Real in a £50m deal after a
  single season and 36 appearances serves as a reminder of the club’s journey
  across the last decade, and their continued eye for smart business. The thing
  worth remembering is that while it appears Bournemouth have been decimated,
  those on the inside recognise this is how their buy-low, sell-high model
  works. The downside is the breakup of a brilliant, buccaneering defence.
  Whether Bournemouth can cope with a flurry of key departures remains to be
  seen but this summer they moved to find a permanent goalkeeping solution in
  Djordje Petrovic, a £25m signing from Chelsea. Finding a commanding No 1
  capable of holding down the position had been a priority after acknowledging
  the stability rival clubs had gained from making similar moves. Petrovic, who
  shone on loan at Strasbourg last season, would appear a solid platform on
  which to build. But for a team that operated with a thin squad last season, it
  is impossible to shake the sense that starting over represents a daunting
  task. The manager Andoni Iraola led Bournemouth to 56 points last season,
  their record tally in the top flight, as they finished ninth, equalling their
  best finish. His appointment two years ago, driven by the now Liverpool
  sporting director Richard Hughes, has proved a masterstroke and last term
  enhanced the reputation of Iraola, the definition of a hands-on coach, among
  rivals. The 43-year-old is into the final 12 months of his contract and while
  he prefers working on rolling contracts, another extension is up in the air.
  Iraola, who does a good line in self-deprecation, is a self-confessed fidget:
  he clicks a multi-colour pen throughout interviews and tapes over some of his
  fingers for superstitious reasons. “It’s stupid,” he said. “But I have done it
  for so many years that I continue doing it.” Off-field picture Bournemouth’s
  80-year-old billionaire owner, Bill Foley, flew from the US in April to
  formally open the club’s £35m state-of-the-art training complex and on the
  same visit he shared another welcome nugget: he has agreed a deal to buy their
  Vitality Stadium home, allowing Bournemouth to expand its capacity to about
  20,000. The Cherries have been locked into an onerous lease with the property
  company Structadene, which bought the ground in 2005, then known as Dean
  Court, for £3.5m, a deal that helped the club avoid administration. Foley –
  via his Black Knight consortium – added the Portuguese club Moreirense to his
  stable, which includes investments in Lorient, Hibernian and Auckland FC. Star
  signing There was so much noise about Kerkez’s departure for Liverpool that
  the arrival of his replacement, signed before Kerkez officially headed for
  Anfield, went under the radar. Adrien Truffert has the tools to be a breakout
  star in the Premier League. Bournemouth sealed the signing of the 23-year-old
  Belgium-born left-back for an initial £11.4m from Rennes, a fee the Cherries –
  and some of their top-flight rivals who have tracked the full-back – regard a
  snip given his profile. Truffert, capped once by France in 2022, was captain
  of Rennes and made his 150th Ligue 1 appearance in May. Perhaps it is a quirk
  of fate that as a toddler he lived in Bournemouth for a year with his family.
  Stepping up Daniel Adu-Adjei spent the first half of last season on loan at
  the bottom of League Two, scoring two goals in 17 appearances for relegated
  Carlisle, so it would be quite the jump if he is involved. The 20-year-old
  striker, born in Hammersmith to Ghanaian parents, has impressed in pre-season,
  scoring against Everton, and trained regularly with the first team at the
  beginning of this year. His father, William, regards Tony Yeboah as one of his
  closest friends, while Daniel is studying a nutrition course funded by the
  Professional Footballers’ Association, his go-to dish a BBQ pulled chicken
  burger. “At Carlisle, I lived by myself and had to cook all my dinners so I
  learned a lot,” he said. A big season for … Few players had as satisfying a
  summer as Alex Scott. Even an awkward face mask, the result of a fractured jaw
  sustained against Aston Villa in May, could not dampen his spirits. Scott
  starred for England as Lee Carsley’s under-21s won the European Championship
  in Slovakia, starting all five matches, though he was forced off through
  injury in the final. Bournemouth paid Bristol City £25m to sign Scott two
  years ago but his progress has been stop-start and he began only eight matches
  last season, largely owing to a lengthy knee injury. Scott, 22 this month, is
  a throwback midfielder, a cute passer with an endearing appetite to get his
  hands dirty. Everybody is craving to see more of his talent.
