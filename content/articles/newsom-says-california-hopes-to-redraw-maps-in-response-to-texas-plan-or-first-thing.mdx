  Good morning. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has said lawmakers will
  proceed with a redistricting plan to counter the Republican-led map drawing
  effort in Texas aimed at securing a House majority after the midterm
  elections. The Democrat plan, known as the election rigging response act,
  would “neuter and neutralize” Republican efforts to gain up to five more seats
  in Texas. It would do so by superseding California’s independent redistricting
  commission and drawing new congressional lines. As Newsom spoke at the
  Japanese American National Museum’s National Center for the Preservation of
  Democracy, federal border patrol agents, armed and masked, raided the area.
  Will Newsom go ahead if Texas stands down? No. The California plan will only
  take place if Texas, or another Republican-led state, redraws its map in favor
  of the GOP. Experts condemn NIH director’s defense of cut to vaccine research
  Experts have criticized the director of the National Institutes of Health’s
  reasoning for cutting funding for research into mRNA vaccines. Jay
  Bhattacharya said the funding to develop these vaccines was being rescinded
  because they had failed to “earn public trust”, but critics said he and other
  top health officials in the Trump administration had been at the forefront of
  spreading doubts about public health institutions and life-saving medicines.
  Bhattacharya’s comments about public trust appeared in an op-ed in the
  Washington Post in which he defended the decision by the anti-vaccine health
  secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, to cut $500m in funding for mRNA vaccine
  research. Kennedy said he was doing so after having “reviewed the science”,
  but experts have said the evidence Kennedy reviewed did not support halting
  the research. What else do experts say about Bhattacharya’s “public trust”
  claims? That the issue is not whether the vaccines have public trust, but
  whether they are safe and effective, which they “clearly” are and this must be
  communicated. Man fleeing Ice raid outside LA Home Depot hit and killed on
  freeway A man was struck by a vehicle and killed as he tried to get away from
  immigration agents who were raiding a Home Depot in Los Angeles county on
  Thursday, authorities have said. While details remain scarce, officials in
  Monrovia confirmed city police officers had seen agents shortly before 10am at
  the store, which allows day laborers to wait outside for work opportunities.
  Soon after, Monrovia emergency services responded to reports of a pedestrian
  struck on the 210 freeway. The state assembly member John Harabedian, who
  represents the area, said 10 people were detained during Thursday’s operation.
  “One individual, fearing for their safety, fled and was tragically struck by a
  vehicle,” he said. Who was the man? He has not been identified. He was
  transported to a local hospital, where he died from his injuries. In other
  news … Donald Trump phoned Norway’s finance minister unexpectedly last month
  to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, according to reports in
  Norwegian media. Israel appears ready to give formal planning approval to an
  illegal West Bank settlement project of more than 3,400 new homes, in a move
  that critics warn will split the occupied territory in two. Donald Trump has
  said he believes Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal on the Ukraine war as
  the two leaders prepare for their meeting in Alaska on Friday. Bolivia looks
  likely to lurch rightwards in its upcoming presidential election on Sunday, as
  the leftist party of former president Evo Morales faces political exile. Stat
  of the day: Hundreds of incarcerated women in California filed sexual abuse
  complaints between 2013 and 2024 Despite female inmates in California filing
  hundreds of complaints of sexual abuse by staff between 2013 and 2024, just
  four officers were fired for sexual misconduct during that period. The data
  suggests this is a structural problem in US prisons. Don’t miss this: ‘I tried
  to be nice. Sometimes, I would explode’ – John Fogerty on Creedence, contracts
  and control John Fogerty wrote some of the most iconic songs of the 1960s with
  Creedence Clearwater Revival. But when his relationship with his brother Tom
  fell apart, and the band split in 1972, things began to go downhill for him. A
  period followed in which he suffered from “an inability to write any new
  songs, an allergic reaction to his old ones (he would turn off the radio if
  they came on), a refusal to play live in any meaningful sense, periods of
  heavy drinking, reckless behaviour, disturbed sleep”. Here, he tells the
  Guardian about how he came out the other side. Climate check: Plastic
  pollution talks fail Negotiators in Geneva have rejected the draft treaties
  for an agreement to end the plastics pollution crisis. The main sticking point
  has been whether the treaty should impose plastic production limits or focus
  instead on waste management, recycling and reuse, with oil- and gas-producing
  countries and the plastics industry opposing production limits. Countries in
  the latter camp include Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iran, reportedly with the
  support of the US. Last Thing: ‘I rent out my mohawk as a billboard’ Bob
  Bagnall pays the bills in an unusual way. You could say he’s in advertising,
  with his hair acting as the billboard. Bagnall, AKA Mohawk Bob, first tried
  out the style when his kids’ school had a “Crazy Hair Day” for the dads, but
  it soon became a permanent look. Then the interest from businesses started
  rolling into his inbox, so much so that he was able to quit his job at the
  grocery store. “I still have a solid hairline for a 58-year-old … Perhaps one
  day it’ll all fall out and I’ll have to start faking it, but until then, I
  don’t think my mohawk’s ever coming off.” You could say it’s hair to stay.
