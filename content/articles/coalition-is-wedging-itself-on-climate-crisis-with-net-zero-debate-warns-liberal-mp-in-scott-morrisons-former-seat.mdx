  One of the Liberal party’s two surviving inner-metropolitan MPs has warned
  voters see the Coalition as unserious on climate change, suggesting the
  opposition could lose more seats to Labor if it opposes policies for net zero
  by 2050. Simon Kennedy, the member for the Sydney seat of Cook, previously
  held by Scott Morrison, told a closed-door meeting of Liberal and Nationals
  MPs at Parliament House that the Coalition should be “wedging” Labor on energy
  policy, not backsliding on efforts to cut carbon emissions. The previously
  unreported comments were prompted by former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce’s
  private member’s bill to overturn net zero, announced last week. After a
  series of anti-net zero statements from Joyce and climate sceptic MPs
  including Barker MP Tony Pasin, Joyce and Nationals senator Matt Canavan,
  Kennedy was the only Coalition MP to speak up for net zero policies. His
  intervention prompted calls of support from a range of Coalition MPs across
  parliament. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Both the Liberals and the
  Nationals are reviewing net zero policies after their May election loss. A
  review of the Coalition’s 2022 federal election defeat noted perceptions of
  the Morrison government’s response to issues including the climate crisis had
  seen it lose voters, including to teal independents. “My personal belief and
  the community’s belief is that we need to be serious on climate and reducing
  energy prices,” sources said Kennedy told the meeting. “There’s a debate on
  net zero and they [the public] interpret us as not being serious on climate.”
  Party room deliberations are traditionally kept confidential. Kennedy
  described climate and energy policies as “Labor’s weakest point”, the sources
  said, predicting the Albanese government would miss its targets for renewables
  uptake and emissions reductions. “It’s a false dichotomy that we have to
  choose between lowering energy prices and lowering emissions,” sources said
  Kennedy told the meeting. “We should be wedging them on their own plan, not
  ourselves.” Guardian Australia approached Kennedy about his comments. He said
  the Coalition should be leading a robust debate about “Labor’s mess”, naming
  the energy and emissions minister, Chris Bowen. “Bowen’s lie of lower energy
  prices is wrecking Australia’s economy and we’ve still failed to meet
  targets,” Kennedy said. “The politics and policy line up for us. We can set a
  clear, credible framework that drives investment in the technology already
  being developed by the private sector. “The Liberal future should be built on
  innovation: delivering cheaper, cleaner power and a stronger economy powered
  by Australian ingenuity, not empty promises.” South Australian Liberal senator
  Andrew McLachlan said the Coalition’s comprehensive policy review, being led
  by the shadow energy minister, Dan Tehan, was warranted. “It is also important
  to note that while some members have begun publicly advocating for the
  abandonment of our net zero by 2050 commitment, that is in no way a fait
  accompli in our party room,” McLachlan said. “There are many in favour of
  continuing our emissions reduction targets, both for environmental and
  economic reasons.” One MP present for the meeting, who spoke on the condition
  of anonymity, said there were frustrations the policy reviews were being
  overshadowed by the small but vocal group opposing net zero. They said
  Kennedy’s comments “solidified support” behind the party process. “It [the net
  zero debate] has caused frustration towards that small group and probably lost
  them some support [internally].” Another Coalition member, also speaking on
  condition of anonymity, said MPs should let the policy reviews run their
  course. “People should respect the process. The process is important to have
  their [Coalition members’] opinions be heard and for us to come up with a
  considered position.” Labor used its majority on Thursday to allow debate on
  Joyce’s private member’s bill in the House of Representatives next month.
  Joyce was the only Coalition MP to vote with the government and members of the
  crossbench to allow debate. Former Liberal minister Simon Birmingham told the
  Australia Grains Industry Conference in Melbourne that Labor and Climate 200
  were successfully weaponising Nationals’ positions on climate against the
  Liberals. “It is a problem. There’s little point shying away from it,” the
  newly appointed Australian Banking Industry chief executive said on Thursday.
  “If you look at the way things that are said by National party figures or
  leaders are then deployed in campaigns against Liberal candidates in those
  urban electorates, it has clearly real cut-through. “The real debate that the
  Coalition can and should be having in terms of talking to voters today is
  about the five- to 10-year horizon: around their power prices, their
  fertiliser prices – the pressure points that are happening on the journey to
  net zero.”
