  Fed governor Lisa Cook

  Donald Trump has suggested he already has a replacement in mind for the
  Federal Reserve governor he is trying to force, even as Lisa Cook said she
  would sue the administration over her removal. Speaking during a cabinet
  meeting lasting more than three hours on Tuesday, the US president said: “We
  have some very good people for that position. I think, maybe in my own mind, I
  have somebody that I like.” Trump said he would consult Scott Bessent, the
  treasury secretary, and Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary. Trump is
  reportedly considering the possibility of naming his economic adviser Stephen
  Miran to serve out the remainder of Cook’s term, which does not expire until
  2038. Earlier this month, Trump nominated Miran to serve for a much shorter
  term, as a replacement for another member of the Fed’s board, Adriana Kugler,
  a Biden nominee who was due to be replaced in five months. Cook has said that
  she will sue to keep her position as a governor of the independent central
  bank and her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called Trump’s move to fire her “illegal”.
  Here is the key Trump administration news of the day: Fed governor to sue over
  Trump attempt to fire her The Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook will sue the
  Trump administration over its bid to fire her over unconfirmed allegations of
  mortgage fraud, her attorney has said. Donald Trump announced he was firing
  Cook on Monday night, in an extraordinary move that marks the latest
  escalation in the US president’s attack on the central bank’s independence.
  But Trump has “no authority” to remove her from the Fed’s board of governors,
  Cook’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, argued in a statement to reporters, saying: “His
  attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or
  legal basis. We will be filing a lawsuit challenging this illegal action.”

  Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than
  $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in
  federal funding to the Ivy League university. “Don’t negotiate with them,
  they’ve been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in
  a cabinet meeting. Read the full story Texas sued for allegedly stripping
  Black voters of political power Texas’s redrawn congressional maps have drawn
  a lawsuit from the NAACP, accusing the state of committing a racial
  gerrymander with its maps that strip Black voters of their political power.
  Read the full story Court tosses Trump lawsuit against Maryland judges over US
  deportations A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed an unprecedented lawsuit
  filed by the Trump administration earlier in the summer against all 15 judges
  serving on Maryland’s federal district court – a case that opposed pausing
  some deportations from the state. In a 37-page ruling, US district judge
  Thomas Cullen of Virginia’s western district – nominated and confirmed to his
  position during Donald Trump’s first presidency – wrote that “any fair reading
  of the legal authorities cited by defendants leads to the ineluctable
  conclusion that this court has no alternative but to dismiss”. Read the full
  story US envoy sparks uproar after telling Lebanese journalists to ‘act
  civilised’ Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US
  envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”. Read the
  full story What else happened today: The Trump administration is cancelling
  another $175m in funding for California’s high-speed rail, marking another
  setback for the state’s much-delayed project. Melania Trump on Tuesday invited
  schools students to participate in a government-sponsored nationwide contest
  that is designed to encourage them to work together to use artificial
  intelligence tools to solve community issues. The Democratic governor of
  Illinois, JB Pritzker, has hit back at Donald Trump for commenting on his
  weight, saying the Republican president is himself “not in good shape” amid
  escalating tension over the possible deployment of the national guard on the
  streets of Chicago. Trump has welcomed Cracker Barrell’s decision to reverse
  changes to its logo that were considered “woke”. Catching up? Here’s what
  happened on 25 August 2025.
