  On Wednesday, China is holding a military parade in the capital, Beijing, to
  mark 80 years since the end of the second world war. But it’s not just about
  the past, the parade says a lot about the forces reshaping the world today,
  and in the future. At the parade, Chinese leader Xi Jinping will be flanked by
  the leaders of some of the world’s most heavily sanctioned nations – Russia,
  North Korea, Iran and Myanmar – and a host of other leaders of the global
  south but notably almost no western leaders. The parade is seen as a show of
  military and diplomatic strength by Beijing amid high-stakes negotiations with
  Donald Trump’s administration in the US over trade. Who is going to China’s
  victory day parade? Russian president Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim
  Jong-un will attend the victory day parade on 3 September, marking the end of
  the second world war after Japan’s formal surrender. It will be the first time
  the two leaders have appeared in public together alongside Xi. Iranian
  president Masoud Pezeshkian is also expected to be on the dais as tens of
  thousands of troops march through the Chinese capital, completing a quartet
  that western political and economic analysts have described as the “axis of
  upheaval”. Myanmar junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, who rarely travels abroad,
  will also attend, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday. Most western
  leaders are expected to shun the parade, making it a major show of diplomatic
  solidarity between China, Russia and the global south. The only western heads
  of state or government attending the events in Beijing are Robert Fico, the
  prime minister of EU member state Slovakia, and Aleksandar Vučić, the
  president of Serbia. Fico has been an opponent of sanctioning Russia for its
  war against Ukraine and has broken ranks with the EU by visiting Moscow. Vučić
  also visited Moscow in May and wants good relations with Russia and China but
  says Serbia remains committed to joining the EU. The United Nations will be
  represented by undersecretary general Li Junhua, who previously served in
  various capacities at the Chinese foreign ministry, including time as the
  Chinese ambassador to Italy, San Marino and Myanmar. What can we expect to see
  at the parade? The highly choreographed event, one of China’s largest in
  years, will unveil cutting-edge equipment such as fighter jets, missile
  defence systems and hypersonic weapons – the results of a long-running
  modernisation drive of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) which has lately
  been beset by corruption scandals and personnel purges. China is expected to
  showcase a range of new weapons, including an enhanced DF-26 intermediate
  range ballistic missile – dubbed by Chinese media the “Guam killer” for its
  ability to hit the US Pacific base with a conventional or nuclear weapon. New
  anti-ship missiles called the Ying Ji, which means “eagle attack” in Chinese,
  have been spotted by analysts. Chinese commentators have described them as
  designed to “prevent the United States from posing a serious threat to China’s
  national security.” On the day, Xi Jinping will survey tens of thousands of
  troops at Tiananmen Square alongside several foreign dignitaries including
  guest of honour Vladimir Putin. Many ordinary Beijing residents who have
  experienced weeks of widespread disruption to their daily lives will be hoping
  for a brief respite. The last time the parade was held in 2015, China
  implemented a nationwide three-day public holiday and Beijing schools delayed
  the start of term. Ahead of the parade, Beijing has also mounted a campaign to
  emphasise the “correct view” of second world war history, which emphasises
  that China and Soviet Russia played a pivotal role in fighting fascist forces
  in the Asian and European theatres. A People’s Daily commentary this week
  claimed China’s contribution to fighting Japan was “selectively ignored and
  underestimated by some”, adding the Communist party’s (CCP) wartime efforts
  were “deliberately belittled and vilified”. What are the experts saying?
  Political analysts say the parade is designed to demonstrate Xi’s influence
  over nations intent on reshaping the western-led global order. “Xi Jinping is
  trying to showcase that he is very strong, that he is still powerful and well
  received in China,” said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew
  school of public policy at the National University of Singapore. “When Xi was
  just a regional leader, he looked up to Putin, and saw the kind of leader he
  could learn from – and now he is a global leader. Having Kim alongside him, as
  well, highlights how Xi is now also a global leader.” Lim Chuan-Tiong, a
  researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University
  of Tokyo, said the primary purpose of the “temporary spectacle” was to
  reinforce Xi’s power and the strength of the CCP. “Commemorating the 80th
  anniversary ... does not necessarily require a military parade,” he said,
  noting that China only really started marking the date 10 years ago, and at a
  fraction of the budget. “Most of the [leaders] attending, the ones invited,
  are not there to support China’s commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the
  victory of WWII,” Lim said. “They are there to give face to China, to give
  face to Chinese leaders and to avoid harming bilateral relations. Very
  simple.” What other world leaders have been in China? Prior to the parade,
  world leaders have been attending the Shanghai cooperation organisation
  security forum (SCO). As well as Vladimir Putin, Indian prime minister
  Narendra Modi and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, have been among
  the attendees. Much has been made of Modi’s visit – his first in seven years –
  just as India’s ties with Washington have soured. It has come days after the
  US doubled tariffs on Indian exports to 50%, citing Delhi’s refusal to stop
  buying Russian oil. For China, the two-day SCO summit that started on Sunday
  could not be better timed. Modi “will be in China at a moment when India-China
  relations are stabilising and India-US relations have gone south. It is a
  powerful optic,” South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said. “I’m not sure
  whether US officials fully realise how much trust they have squandered in such
  a short time.” With additional research by Lillian Yang and reporting by
  Reuters
