  The suspect in the recent deadly shooting of US comedian Reggie Carroll
  reportedly had been working as security for fellow standup comic Katt
  Williams, with whom the slain entertainer had toured with. Tranell Marquise
  Williams, the man suspected of murdering Carroll on 20 August in Southaven,
  Mississippi, had also been on the tour in question providing his services at
  the time of his arrest, according to the news outlet WHBQ. The station, based
  in nearby Memphis, Tennessee, attributed the information to three independent
  sources in a report published Tuesday. Local police have said officers
  responding to a shooting at a home on Southaven’s Burton Lane found Carroll,
  52, critically wounded. The Baltimore native later died at a hospital in
  Memphis where he had been brought for emergency treatment. Southaven police
  said relatively quickly that they had arrested a man in connection with
  Carroll’s death and jailed him on a count of murder. But it wasn’t until
  Monday that they identified that suspect as Tranell Williams, 38. Police by
  Monday had posted a 14-day notice requesting occupants leave the Burton Lane
  home where Carroll had been killed, which was also the address provided for a
  clothing line owned by Katt Williams, 53, WHBQ reported. Additionally, that
  home was listed as Tranell Williams’s last known address. Posts on a social
  media page belonging to the victim showed him traveling earlier in the year on
  Katt Williams’s ongoing Heaven on Earth comedy tour. Carroll’s brother – Kempe
  Earle – and a friend, Gerald Kelly, told WHBQ they were in disbelief over his
  killing. “Man, it’s like your family member, your brother, your closest
  relative goes out of town, and something happens to them, and you don’t know
  what exactly,” Earle said. Earle added that Carroll was in Southaven because
  he was “out there … with Katt Williams”. Kelly remarked: “I’m still numb – I’m
  frustrated. I’m ready to go to war. We need answers.” Katt Williams’s film and
  television credits include Friday After Next as well as The Boondocks.
  Carroll, meanwhile, gained a following while performing in comedy clubs across
  the US. He appeared on the live variety series Showtime at the Apollo, the
  2023 standup special Knockout Kings of Comedy and the 2022 television movie
  Rent &amp; Go. One of his most notable credits on the Internet Movie Database
  was an episode of The Parkers, a sitcom which starred Mo’Nique. The
  Oscar-winning actor was among those who paid tribute to Carroll as word of his
  death spread, saying on social media that she had “an amazing time being on
  tour together” with him. “The last time me and my brother Reggie, girl, was
  together – that’s what it was, an amazing time being on tour together, being
  on that road together, what a time,” Mo’Nique said. “So I have no sad tears
  because all of our times together [were] amazing.”
