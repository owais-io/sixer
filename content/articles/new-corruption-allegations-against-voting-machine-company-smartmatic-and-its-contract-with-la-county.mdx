  contract with LA county

  The justice department is alleging in a new court filing that three Smartmatic
  executives who were indicted last year on bribery and money-laundering charges
  transferred money from a 2018 voting machine contract with Los Angeles county
  into slush funds that were originally set up to pay bribes to election
  officials in Venezuela and the Philippines between 2012 and 2016 to obtain and
  retain lucrative election contracts. Prosecutors say one of the executives
  transferred an undisclosed amount from the $282m LA county contract into the
  slush funds in 2019 but did not say if anyone actually received bribes from
  the county’s money at that point. The government is seeking to prove the funds
  were part of a long pattern of bribing election officials by Smartmatic, the
  voting machine company, which sued Fox News for defamation after the 2020
  election. A separate court filing in a lawsuit brought by Fox News against LA
  county to obtain records about Smartmatic’s relationship with Dean Logan, LA
  county’s registrar-recorder and county clerk who oversees elections and the
  Smartmatic contract, Fox News asserts that Logan may have received
  inappropriate gifts from the company in the form of business-class travel and
  upscale restaurant meals. Logan is supposed to report vendor gifts above $50
  on annual disclosure forms, but records obtained by Fox News and included in
  the court filing show he did not report some gifts from Smartmatic. Logan
  maintains he was not required to report the travel or a meal that Fox
  highlights in its filing. Fox News is seeking the records from LA county to
  support its defense against a defamation suit filed against it by Smartmatic
  in 2021. Last year, prosecutors in Florida filed corruption charges against
  the president of UK-based Smartmatic, along with two other current and former
  executives, for allegedly operating a years-long bribery and money-laundering
  scheme that paid bribes to an election official in the Philippines. The
  justice department has since said that the scheme involved payments to
  officials in Venezuela as well, where the company obtained its first elections
  contract in 2004. US election integrity activists have long been concerned
  about Smartmatic’s contract with LA county, due to the company’s controversial
  history, the founders’ ties to Venezuela and a lack of transparency over
  company ownership. The company first tried to get into the US elections market
  in 2006, but a federal investigation into its ownership and potential ties to
  the Venezuelan government at the time put a halt to its US ambitions until it
  obtained the contract with LA county in 2018. Concerns about the company and
  its role in US elections increased last year when the justice department
  indicted its executives. The new revelations about the LA county money raise
  even more questions about the county’s contract. Prosecutors allege that the
  Smartmatic executives conspired for years with the owner of Jarltech
  International, a hardware maker in Taiwan that manufactured voting machines
  for Smartmatic, to overcharge customers for the systems it built then used the
  excess money to pay bribes to election officials in the Philippines and
  Venezuela. Prosecutors do not say if they overcharged LA county as well or if
  any LA county money actually got paid out in bribes to anyone – only that some
  of that money made it into slush funds that had been used in the past to pay
  bribes. The justice department declined to answer questions about the case but
  said in a court filing that it has documents and witness testimony to support
  its claims about LA county’s money. Smartmatic itself has not been accused of
  wrongdoing, only the three executives. But a Smartmatic spokesperson says the
  justice department allegations are “filled with misrepresentations” and also
  says the company operates “ethically” and abides “by all laws always, both in
  Los Angeles county and every jurisdiction where we operate”. The new
  allegations are not part of charges the justice department brought against the
  Smartmatic executives. Prosecutors are only asking a Florida court to allow
  evidence about the LA county money to show a pattern in how the executives
  managed their alleged bribery and money-laundering scheme. After news of the
  indictments broke last year, the county barred the three executives from any
  further association with its Smartmatic contract but did not “debar” the
  company itself, something it can do if a contractor shows a lack of “business
  integrity or business honesty”. The county can also terminate a contract if a
  vendor gives any county officer or employee “improper consideration” in the
  form of travel, entertainment or tangible gifts to secure favor. But Logan’s
  office says it stands by its work with the company. With regard to the
  implication that LA county money that got into the slush funds might have come
  from overcharging the county, Logan says the county’s contract with Smartmatic
  uses fixed pricing. “The alleged actions in the federal matter are unrelated
  to the work performed under contract by Smartmatic for Los Angeles County,”
  according to a statement sent by Logan in an email. “The County has no
  knowledge or visibility into how Smartmatic USA used proceeds from that
  contract; however, the County does validate work performed and deliverable
  requirements aligned to the fixed price structure of the contract prior to
  making any payments.” The contract runs through March 2027, but has three,
  two-year extension options that, if exercised, would stretch the agreement to
  2033. It also does allow for changes in pricing up to 10% of the contracted
  amounts. The three indicted executives include company president and
  co-founder, Roger Alejandro Piñate Martinez Jr; Jorge Vasquez, former
  vice-president of hardware development for Smartmatic’s US division; and Elie
  Moreno, who oversaw the company’s contracts. According to a company bio,
  Piñate, who goes by Roger Piñate, played a “critical” role in winning the LA
  county contract and was chief operating officer until becoming president in
  2018, the year Smartmatic won the Los Angeles contract. Piñate is a Venezuelan
  citizen and permanent US resident, and Elie Moreno is a Venezuelan-Israeli.
  The company put Piñate and Moreno on administrative leave after the
  announcement of their indictments last year, and currently Ruliena Piñate,
  Roger’s cousin, oversees Smartmatic’s LA contract with another employee. She
  was co-president with her cousin before his indictment. Vasquez, a US citizen,
  left Smartmatic in 2021 in the midst of the justice department investigation.
  The justice department accuses him of receiving direct kickbacks for his role
  in the alleged scheme. Controversial beginnings Smartmatic has been dogged by
  controversy almost since its founding in Florida in 1999 by Piñate and two
  fellow Venezuelan engineers – Antonio Mugica and Alfredo José Anzola – as a
  network applications developer. The company shifted to voting machines in 2004
  when then-Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez was threatened with a recall
  referendum. Months before the recall election, Venezuela’s National Electoral
  Council announced it would replace the country’s six-year-old voting machines
  with new ones under a $91m contract awarded to Smartmatic, Bizta – a small
  software firm owned by Mugica and his father – and the state-run telecom
  CANTV. Smartmatic and Bizta got the contract despite having no experience in
  voting machines or elections. There were other concerns about the deal as
  well: the Venezuelan government owned 28% of Bizta through a $200,000
  investment in the firm, a close associate of Chávez was on Bizta’s board, and
  two of the five members of the electoral council denounced the contract,
  citing irregularity with the bidding process. Chávez survived his recall
  battle, though not without additional controversy: he and his supporters were
  accused of rigging the election based on an outcome that differed from an exit
  poll. However, after an audit of the results, the US-based Carter Center,
  which monitors overseas elections, supported the outcome, as did the US state
  department. Riding its success in Venezuela, Smartmatic tried to enter the US
  elections market in 2006 by using money from the Venezuela contract to buy the
  California-based Sequoia Voting Systems, whose voting systems were used across
  the US. The purchase caught the attention of the Committee on Foreign
  Investment in the United States, which launched an investigation into
  Smartmatic’s ownership and possible ties to the Venezuelan government. But
  rather than cooperate with the federal inquiry, Smartmatic quickly sold off
  Sequoia. The company then turned to Europe and other election markets, moving
  its headquarters to the UK in 2012. It won a contract worth more than $180m to
  supply the Philippines with more than 90,000 voting machines for its 2016
  elections, with Jarltech International on board to manufacture the machines.
  But the company became embroiled in more controversy almost immediately after
  the election when Philippine authorities charged the head of Smartmatic’s
  technical support team and two subordinates with accessing a system on
  election night used to transmit unofficial results and making an unauthorized
  change to code. The case was later dismissed. Two years after the Philippines
  election, Smartmatic won the Los Angeles contract. Smartmatic hoped to parlay
  this win to expand across the US. But after its machines were used for the
  first time in the 2020 presidential primary and general election, Donald
  Trump, who lost the election, falsely accused Smartmatic and Dominion Voting
  Systems of manipulating the results to give the election to Joe Biden. These
  claims were amplified by Fox News and other media outlets sympathetic to
  Trump, and in 2021, Smartmatic filed a series of defamation lawsuits against
  media outlets and Trump supporters who they say encouraged and amplified the
  vote-rigging assertions, including a $2.7bn defamation suit against Fox News.
  Smartmatic claims Fox News reporting decimated its US business prospects,
  causing other election jurisdictions to shun it. But Fox News says it simply
  covered newsworthy claims made by Trump and others. Last year Smartmatic
  settled a similar suit against Newsmax for $40m and against One America News
  for an undisclosed sum and seemed to be on path to win or settle the Fox News
  suit as well until the indictment of its executives. Fox News has used the
  indictments and alleged bribery scheme to support its defense in the
  defamation suit, saying in court documents that if the company has had trouble
  expanding its business in the US, it’s due to these allegations and the
  company’s troubled history, not Fox News reporting. The charges Prosecutors
  from the southern district of Florida allege that the three Smartmatic
  executives and Jarltech owner Andy Wang engaged in a years-long conspiracy to
  overcharge the Philippines government for voting machines, then used the
  fraudulently obtained funds to pay more than $1m in kickbacks to Juan Andres
  Bautista – chair of the Philippine elections commission at the time – to win
  and retain a contract to supply systems for the 2016 elections there. Jarltech
  allegedly overcharged the Philippines government $10-$50 per voting machine in
  “extra” or “rush” fees, amassing about $6m in a slush fund to pay the bribes.
  Wang allegedly managed the funds in Hong Kong bank accounts, and Smartmatic
  executives directed the payments, using bogus purchasing agreements, shell
  companies and banks in Europe, Asia and the US. Bautista passed the money to a
  family member who then bought a condo in San Francisco, prosecutors say. Wang
  did not respond to questions from the Guardian. The justice department
  investigation began after Bautista’s estranged wife told Philippine
  authorities in 2017 that her husband had $20m in “unexplained wealth” and
  provided them with 35 passbooks for offshore bank accounts in Bautista’s name.
  Bautista resigned as chair of the election commission two months later, and in
  2023, news broke that the justice department had filed charges against him and
  was investigating unnamed Smartmatic executives as well. But the scheme didn’t
  start with the Philippines. Prosecutors say the conspirators had also inflated
  the cost of voting machines sold to Venezuela to amass $4m for bribes paid to
  unnamed Venezuelan officials between 2012 and 2014 , showing a pattern of
  illegal activity. In 2019, prosecutors say Piñate also transferred ownership
  of an upscale home in Caracas to Tibisay Lucena Ramírez, then president of the
  Venezuelan National Electoral Council, to secure her assistance with its
  business interests in that country. A Smartmatic spokesperson calls the house
  claim “untethered from reality”. She says Smartmatic “ceased all operations in
  Venezuela in August 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has
  never sought to secure business there again”. In 2017, Smartmatic accused the
  Venezuelan electoral council and the Nicolás Maduro regime of manipulating
  voter turnout numbers and election results and ceased business in the country.
  But prosecutors say Piñate hoped to repair the relationship with Venezuela
  with Ramírez’s help and gave her the Caracas home as a bribe. Ramírez died in
  2023. Los Angeles county The federal case against Smartmatic executives and
  the company’s lawsuit against Fox News have now become intertwined due to the
  new allegations about the LA county money and questions about whether the
  executives used bribes to win favor around the county contract. Fox News says
  in its recent filing against LA county that it “does not yet have evidence
  that slush fund payments or real estate title transfers were made to any L.A.
  County official”, but it says that gifts Logan received from the company
  follow “patterns of misconduct” that prosecutors have alleged occurred in
  other countries, and that Logan cultivated an unusually close relationship
  with Smartmatic executives that went “well beyond typical business
  relationships.” Logan took a nine-day trip to the Maldives and Taiwan in July
  2019 that was partially funded by Smartmatic, including business-class air
  fare, accommodations and meals, according to text messages obtained by Fox
  News and included in its court filing. The Maldives portion was covered by an
  organization that invited Logan to speak there, but Smartmatic paid for
  Logan’s travel to Taiwan. Based on another text message not included in the
  court filing but seen by the Guardian, Smartmatic played a role in
  coordinating the conference invitation to Logan as well. Logan’s wife
  accompanied him on the trip, but the text messages indicate he gave his credit
  card number to Smartmatic to cover her $5,000 air fare. Logan and his wife
  tacked on tourist activity to the Taiwan portion of their trip, and it’s not
  clear how much Smartmatic paid for the entire excursion. Under California Fair
  Political Practices Commission regulations, gifts to state and local officials
  from a single source were limited to $500 a year when Logan took the trip.
  Smartmatic would not say how much it paid for the Taiwan trip, citing ongoing
  litigation. An LA county spokesperson said in an email that the Taiwan trip
  was not a gift but a work trip to conduct oversight of the manufacturing
  process – the trip included a visit to Jarltech, the subcontractor that was
  making the hardware for LA county’s machines. The spokesperson wrote: “the
  lead from the County’s VSAP design contractor was also part of the trip, which
  included detailed reviews and presentations of products that required approval
  prior to manufacturing, and onsite visits to multiple product and
  manufacturing assembly plants/operations.” Approval of the manufacturing
  process was required as part of the contract, he says, and “protocols for
  notification and approval of the travel were followed and are documented in
  the responsive records provided [to Fox News]”. Asked why the project manager
  for the contract, whose job is “inspecting any and all tasks, deliverables,
  goods, services, or other work provided by or on behalf of the Contractor”
  didn’t visit the Jarltech facilities instead of Logan, spokesperson Michael
  Sanchez said that as chief elections official “Logan had and continues to have
  clear responsibility for ensuring contract compliance.” Fox News disputes that
  the travel was covered under the contract, noting that the contract only
  mentions paying travel expenses if county officials are auditing financial
  records related to Smartmatic’s contract with the county and have to travel
  outside the county to view the company’s financial records. Sanchez says the
  paragraph addressing travel expenses “is not limited to the inspection of
  financial records for a financial audit” but includes travel to “examine … any
  pertinent transaction, activity, or record” relating to the contract. In
  addition to the Taiwan travel, Fox News says Smartmatic paid for an unknown
  number of meals in upscale restaurants for Logan, at least one of which Logan
  did not report on annual disclosure form in 2022. In a deposition in the
  lawsuit Fox has filed against LA county to obtain Logan’s records, Logan
  disputes that he was required to report the meal because he says it was a
  personal meal with a Smartmatic employee. He also rejects the suggestion that
  Smartmatic won its contract out of favoritism. “The contract between Los
  Angeles County and Smartmatic USA was competitively bid, evaluated, and
  awarded in compliance with the County’s open competitive public procurement
  processes,” Logan wrote in an email.
