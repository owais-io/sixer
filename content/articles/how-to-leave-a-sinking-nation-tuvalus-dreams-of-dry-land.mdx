  In November 2022, Simon Kofe, then foreign minister of the island nation of
  Tuvalu, announced a sensational plan for his country’s survival. Climate
  breakdown poses an existential threat to small island-nations in the Pacific,
  but Tuvalu’s geography makes it especially vulnerable. The highest point of
  elevation in the country is 4.5 metres. If the water rises, there is no hill
  to run to. In the past four decades, local sea level has risen twice as fast
  as the global average. By 2050, the government expects half of the capital,
  Funafuti, to be flooded by tidal waters. By the end of the century, more than
  90% of the land could be submerged. “As our land disappears, we have no choice
  but to become the world’s first digital nation,” Kofe declared in a video
  address to delegates at the UN climate conference Cop27. In the background was
  an islet of Funafuti, Te Afualiku. “Islands like this one won’t survive,” Kofe
  said. Then came the twist: “So, we will recreate them virtually.” Organ music
  swelled, the camera zoomed out, and the image of Kofe standing on the island
  flickered like a glitch in a video game. The leaves of the trees behind Kofe
  were bathed in sunlight, but as the view widened, the sky was revealed as a
  black void: Kofe was delivering his address from a digital rendition of the
  islet. As he continued his speech, the camera went higher, as if on a drone,
  and Kofe became smaller and smaller. Frigate birds circled above him,
  signifying bad weather. “Without a global conscience and a global commitment
  to our shared wellbeing,” Kofe continued, “we may soon find the rest of the
  world joining us online, as their lands disappear.” As an advertisement to
  draw attention to Tuvalu’s grim predicament, it was designed to shock. The
  words Kofe spoke had been polished by an Australian creative agency affiliated
  with Accenture. They generated a tremendous market response: travel vloggers
  began to descend on the “sinking nation”, followed by country-counting
  tourists who wanted to get a glimpse before it disappears. The idea of a
  virtual future for Tuvalu generated frenzied commentary. By creating a digital
  clone of the islands, a headline in the Guardian pondered, could we not
  “preserve the island nation before it’s lost to the collapsing climate?” The
  Sydney Morning Herald reported, “Tuvalu turns to metaverse to guarantee its
  existence.” The video won an award at the Cannes Lions international festival
  of creativity, beating ads for Mastercard and Budweiser. Adweek reported on
  the “award-winning metaverse project that’s saving a nation”. This was a time
  when the US media was producing two articles a day about the metaverse: it was
  going to “shape our future”, it was the “future of connection”, it was
  “reality beyond fantasy”. It also became something that might save poor Tuvalu
  from extinction. Yet this outlandish idea sidestepped the most basic question
  posed by Tuvalu’s possible submersion: where are the people going to go? Last
  year, I flew from New York to Fiji, which provides the only aerial connection
  to Tuvalu, to find out how Tuvaluans felt about the future that the government
  had imagined for them. * * * Spread 420 miles across the western Pacific,
  halfway between Australia and Hawaii, Tuvalu is made up of nine islands, six
  of which are atolls. Funafuti is an atoll, consisting of 33 individual islets.
  Their combined surface area is smaller than Central Park, and the lagoon they
  surround is spread over 103 sq miles. From the window of a low-flying, 68-seat
  aircraft that flies three times a week to Tuvalu from Fiji, I could only see a
  part of the atoll, not the whole ring. There were no tall structures visible,
  no sprawl of cement and no bridges connecting the islets, some of which are
  completely covered in a huddle of treetops. The population of Tuvalu is just
  over 11,000 and more than half of the people live on a single islet of
  Funafuti, called Fongafale. It is a sliver of land eight miles long, with a
  small airstrip near the centre. After my plane landed, it came to a stop in
  front of a small airport building. Going through immigration, customs and the
  exit took about five minutes. Filamona Lodge, one of the four lodging options
  in the country, where I had booked a room, was less than 100 metres away. It
  was a two-storey house, in which more than a dozen rooms had been carved out
  with thin walls. The upper floor was made of planks of wood. The owner-family
  lived in the back. The open-air restaurant was almost full when I arrived,
  because the airport has no lounge, and the departing passengers come here to
  sit, wait and sweat after checking in their luggage. Metia Lotoala, a
  30-year-old father of three, with buzzed hair, a goatee and a look of
  perpetual amusement on his face, showed me to my room. Lotoala grew up in
  Tuvalu and his family owns the lodge. My room was slightly bigger than the
  others but the best part, Lotoala told me, was that it was adjacent to a
  balcony, which overlooked the airstrip. In the evening, I realised what he
  meant. The widest open area on the islet, the airstrip is an essential part of
  daily life. After 5pm, when the temperature climbed down, it transformed into
  a town square. Soccer goalposts and volleyball nets were brought out and
  placed on the runway. Young men dashed about in trainers and shorts; old men
  watched them sitting cross-legged on their mopeds. Families laid out picnics
  on mats made by weaving the leaves of the pandanus tree, which, along with
  pukas and coconuts, line the edge of the airstrip. At 6.45pm, under an indigo
  sky, church bells rang out along the main street and all movement on the islet
  came to a halt. Those walking back home stopped by the side of the streets,
  mopeds and cars turned off their engines. Like many island-nations in the
  Pacific, Tuvalu is devoutly Christian. Every evening, 15 minutes are reserved
  for prayer time. By the side of a road that runs along the airstrip, I chatted
  with a police officer who had asked me to stop and wait. She told me that
  there are 132 police personnel in the country, and the last notable crime took
  place in 2015, when a drunk motorcycle rider ran over someone who was sleeping
  the night at the airstrip. Sleeping at the airstrip used to be common practice
  and continues to be permitted; since the accident, cars and mopeds have been
  banned. Night descended quickly and by 7pm it was dark. Back at the lodge, the
  plastic chairs of the restaurant were occupied by a couple from Peru, two
  college students from Hong Kong and an Indian sexologist. A story I heard
  there, later confirmed by Lotoala, was about a tourist who arrived a few weeks
  earlier, spent about an hour walking about, then bought a return ticket, and
  flew back on the same flight he had come on. The tourists I met had been
  flying around the Pacific and were all heading to their next destination in a
  couple of days. No one felt they hadn’t spent enough time, no one said they’d
  be coming back. After a dinner of chicken soup, I asked what had brought them
  here, to one of the least visited countries in the world. MR Krishna, the
  Indian sexologist, told me he had come “to see Tuvalu before it disappears”. *
  * * A couple of days later, I went to see Simon Kofe. He was almost defensive
  when I asked him about the Cop27 address. “Everything I said in my speech was
  backed by science,” he told me, sitting in the porch of his lagoon-facing
  house, where the video was filmed on a green screen. “If our statehood is
  permanent and we lose our physical territory, a digital nation is going to be
  the representation of the sovereign state of Tuvalu.” Kofe reminded me that he
  had “never used the word ‘metaverse’” in his address. He was surprised to see
  that “that’s what everyone ran with”. Media outlets, especially those covering
  technology, have portrayed Tuvalu as a country leaping into a digital future,
  but in terms of internet accessibility, landing in Tuvalu felt like
  time-travelling to the mid-2000s. No international telecommunications service
  has coverage here. The only way to connect to the internet was to buy a sim
  card from the office of Tuvalu telecom, which opens for a few hours every
  weekday. A woman handed me a sim card after noting down, by hand, the details
  of my passport in a long register. The sim card offered 2G speed and sketchy
  network. It cost more than $10 for two gigabytes of data, and I was unable to
  load a YouTube clip of Kofe’s famous address. I was told that a few houses had
  set up Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet connection, but it is far out
  of the financial reach of most locals. In a bid to counter China’s overtures
  in the region, Japan, Australia and Taiwan, led by the United States, are
  working out a plan to connect several Pacific states with an undersea internet
  cable, but completion is years away. “First we will have to bring the
  internet,” Kofe told me. “It is not something that will happen overnight.” In
  2023, the government of Tuvalu amended its constitution to note that “the
  state of Tuvalu … shall remain in perpetuity in the future”, irrespective “of
  climate change or other causes resulting in loss to the physical territory”.
  Since then, Tuvalu has managed to get more than a dozen bilateral partners,
  including New Zealand and Australia, to formally acknowledge its permanent
  statehood. The idea has unanimous appeal, and acceptance, across the region,
  where several other countries’ boundaries are similarly threatened by the
  climate crisis. In international law, a state is traditionally defined as an
  entity with four attributes: a permanent population, a defined territory, a
  government, and the capacity to form relationships with other states.
  Submersion means Tuvalu will fail to meet the first two criteria. And with
  this, come other tricky questions. The sale of fishing licences contributes
  almost half of Tuvalu’s national income – would an underwater but online
  Tuvalu retain these territorial rights over maritime territory? The government
  has taken steps, by amending its constitution and securing bilateral
  agreements, to secure its future sovereignty over the waters – but this may
  have far-reaching implications for international law, and the commonly
  understood meaning of statehood itself. “Statehood is a fiction, a legal
  fiction that we came up with,” says Sumudu Atapattu, the director of the
  Global Legal Studies Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison law school.
  In this century, as the climate crisis will scramble the commonly understood
  meanings of nationhood and sovereignty, the world is going to have to come up
  with, in Atapattu’s words, “a new fiction”. Digital statehood is an attempt at
  this redefinition, but at this stage the details are unknown. Recent bilateral
  agreements with New Zealand and Australia provide residential visas to a few
  hundred Tuvaluans each year to move to those countries, but a far greater
  number of locals aspire to emigrate than the 355 who receive these visas every
  year. In June, when applications opened for the first time for 280 Australian
  visas to be allocated to Tuvaluans, more than 8,000 people applied. But at the
  current rate, it will take more than 30 years for everyone to leave Tuvalu, by
  which time Funafuti, according to government estimates, might be underwater. *
  * * Grace Malie grew up in Fongafale. For high school she moved to Vaitupu,
  the largest atoll of Tuvalu, where just over 1,000 people live. Students from
  all the other islands attend Motufoua secondary school while living with local
  families in Vaitupu. Malie told me she learned the local dances, faatele in
  Tuvaluan, from all the eight inhabited islands of Tuvalu, each of which has
  distinct linguistic dialects and customs. Later, she went to study at the
  University of the South Pacific in Fiji, moved back to Fongafale, and worked
  briefly as an assistant to Kofe. In 2023, at the age of 24, Malie visited
  Cop28 in Dubai as a youth delegate. “I find it kind of hard to accept when I
  ask people where they are from, and they say, ‘New York’, and I say, ‘The big
  city!’” she told me. “But when I say, ‘I’m from Tuvalu’, they’re like,
  ‘Where?’, and I say, ‘In the Pacific’, and they’re like, ‘Where?’, then I say,
  ‘You know Australia? Hawaii? Yeah. Somewhere in between there.’” Malie said
  that the people she was talking to probably couldn’t even imagine what Tuvalu
  looks like. Malie appreciated how Kofe’s speeches were changing that. But she
  was also disturbed by the image of the virtual islet where Kofe was standing
  in the 2022 video. “The visuals are for people who are not living here to be
  able to see, and for us, it is like …” Without finishing that sentence, Malie
  popped her eyes and retreated into her chair behind outstretched hands. Was it
  scary to watch? I asked. “Yes,” Malie said. “It brought the reality closer to
  home.” I met Malie shortly after she had returned from Cop28 with her friend
  Tamala Pita, who was sitting with us at the restaurant of Filamona Lodge. As
  youth delegates, Malie and Pita told me, it was exhausting to talk about
  erosion, submersion, migration and weave it together with their personal
  experiences. “It was emotional,” Malie said. “You are talking about losing
  your home to these strangers, and you think about what you are saying, and you
  start crying, it is just emotionally draining.” Both Malie and Pita broke down
  several times during the nine days in Dubai; they consoled each other and were
  consoled by youth delegates from other developing nations. Both were stunned
  by the excessive, needless use of indoor lighting and air-conditioning. Pita
  said: “There were lights on the floor of the metro station! I was like, do you
  really need that?” Whenever Malie is away, she is always thinking of
  returning. I asked her what she misses when she is travelling. “Ohh,” she
  said, letting her shoulders droop. Then, with a burst of energy: “Everything!
  Being able to sleep with your door open, the wind coming into the house, there
  is no homelessness here, there is no stress.” Many houses in Tuvalu have
  openings on all sides, with sloping roofs made of thatch or corrugated iron.
  Generally, the house is one big hall, where the family sleeps on mattresses on
  the floor. The bedding is rolled up and put in a corner in the morning, and
  the hall becomes the living room. What is it like to consider, I asked Malie,
  that Tuvalu might become uninhabitable in her lifetime. “We need to convey
  that possibility, but we also want to try to make sure that doesn’t actually
  happen to us,” she said. It is a difficult balance. Tuvalu is walking a fine
  line: to get the attention of the world, it must publicise its own
  disappearance, while doing everything it can to survive. The government of
  Tuvalu is reclaiming land on the lagoon side, with funds from the UN. That
  gives Malie hope. So does her religious faith. “We always have journalists
  coming up and talking about these scientific facts, but then we have to remain
  true to our fight and our cause and our people, and we have remained resilient
  and remained hopeful,” she told me. “We’ve said this so many times, but the
  motto of Tuvalu is ‘Tuvalu mo te Atua’, which means, Tuvalu with God.” * * *
  Until recently, Tuvalu was best known for its fortuitous top-level domain –
  .tv. In 1995, a government office in Fongafale received a fax, informing them
  that Tuvalu’s country code on the world wide web had been assigned. The
  government officials gathered around the fax, one recalled in 2019, and
  wondered: “What the hell is this internet thing?” Before long, video platforms
  wanted URLs ending in .tv, and Tuvalu cashed in. Every streaming company
  running a website address that ends in .tv, from Amazon to Apple to Hulu to
  Twitch, pays a licensing fee. Last year, it contributed more than $10m to the
  country’s $80m revenue. Besides the licences for tuna fishing in its
  territorial waters, which amount to about $35m, .tv is Tuvalu’s second-largest
  source of income. Before it became independent in 1978, Tuvalu had been under
  British rule for almost a century. When independence was looming, it was
  important to Tuvaluans to not be merged with the Gilbert islands, which became
  Kiribati. Tito Isala, a septuagenarian with curly white hair, who was part of
  the committee that negotiated the terms of independence in the 1970s and lived
  with his wife a few houses down the road from my lodge, told me that Kiribati,
  which has a surface area of 300 sq miles, would have “swallowed little
  Tuvalu”. They decided to become an independent country comprising nine atolls,
  eight of which were inhabited, and adopted the name Tuvalu, which in Tuvaluan
  means eight standing together. Today, Fongafale, on its less than one sq mile
  of land, houses more than 6,000 people, and offers them few services. There
  was no ATM in the country until a few months ago. There are no barbershops;
  people cut their own hair or wait till their next visit to Fiji. A small
  garden run by a Taiwanese aid agency is the only source of fresh produce. A
  bag of vegetables can be bought once or twice a week, at $13 each. Locals
  catch fish in the lagoon, which is the only source of fresh meat in the
  country besides pork; neither is available in plenty. The population is
  sustained by imported food. A supermarket, a warehouse really, near the north
  end of the airstrip, accounts for more than 70% of the country’s imports. It
  sells butter manufactured in California, Japanese washing machines, and sofas
  of unspecified origins; this is also where everyone buys vegetables, grain and
  meat. Sacks of rice are piled in one corner. Imported, processed food has
  disturbed the diet. A quarter of Tuvalu’s population has diabetes. Tuvalu,
  according to the UN, is among the world’s least-developed countries. On the
  northern end of Fongafale, just before the point where Kofe made his famous
  address, there is a huge garbage dump – among the tallest structures on the
  island – which sometimes combusts spontaneously. On the southern end is a
  rusted warship, and the stony beach is covered in broken glass and plastic
  bottles, torn clothes and washed-up Blundstone boots. People who live here
  feel deeply connected to the place, but even they concede that to see how
  beautiful Tuvalu is, one must get out of Fongafale, and go to the outer
  islands. “Too many people live here, that’s the problem,” Lotoala, the motel
  owner, said to me. One evening in the balcony next to my room, I asked Lotoala
  what he thought about the threat posed by the climate crisis to Tuvalu. “Do
  you mean that the islands might drown?” he asked me. When I said yes, he
  responded: “I don’t think it will happen.” With a boyish, confessional smile,
  he added: “People don’t like you when you say that. But I don’t think it will
  happen.” He knew that when the tides run high, around March every year, water
  seeps through the ground in Fongafale. “But it only happens at that one
  place,” he said. “It has been happening there since I was a kid.” Lotoala
  believes that it will be “hundreds” of years before the islands are fully
  submerged, but he knows that it will become increasingly difficult to continue
  to live here. “This is what I tell my children: you have to think about
  moving, about being flexible, you have to have that mindset, you should not
  get stuck here.” The idea of submersion is not convincing to all the locals.
  They have seen the erosion of Fongafale before their eyes and are acutely
  aware of the changing climate, but at the same time, they have also seen
  atolls grow and gain ground. Tito Isala dismissed all talk of a digital future
  with a wave of his hand: “It is defeatist, hopeless.” Nor was he excited about
  the idea of Tuvaluans settling on foreign shores. “We do not want to
  relocate,” he said. “Where are we going to go? New Zealand?” Isala said. “How
  do they treat the Māori?” He gave me another hypothetical. “America? Who wants
  to deal with their Trumps and Bidens?” Isala opened an iron chest in his
  living room and pulled out a large, laminated, navigational map of Funafuti.
  He unrolled it on the top of the trunk. “The islets make the shape of a human
  face in profile; we are here, at the back of the head,” he said, pointing to
  Fongafale. “Here we have lost land.” Then he pointed to the chin on the map,
  at an islet of Funafuti called Motuloa. “Motuloa has grown its landmass,”
  Isala said. * * * The local understanding of the adaptability of the atolls is
  backed up by some scientific data. When Malie had told me submersion “is a
  possibility”, she wasn’t simply dismissing the projections of sea level rise
  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “The signs are very clear,
  especially from the IPCC reports,” Malie said. “But then you have other
  science, which is uncertain, which says it [submersion] might happen, it might
  not happen.” This “other science” is mainly based on the work of Paul Kench, a
  coastal geomorphologist who has studied shoreline changes in the Maldives,
  Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the Great Barrier Reef, Kiribati and Tuvalu. Kench
  studied coastal changes and physical geography of islands at the University of
  Auckland, then did his PhD at the University of New South Wales, where his
  dissertation was on atolls in the Indian Ocean. When we spoke on Zoom, Kench
  was in Singapore, where he is a professor in the department of geography at
  the National University. Kench has amassed a significant body of work to show
  that rising sea level does not necessarily mean the submersion of low-lying
  atolls. The projections of Tuvalu’s disappearance assume that atoll islands
  are static structures. Kench’s work shows that they are instead dynamic
  entities that are constantly transforming themselves, even gaining landmass.
  Using data from aerial images going back to the second world war, Kench showed
  that in the past four decades, while sea level rose in Tuvalu twice as fast
  the global average, total land area slightly increased, by 2.9%. The greatest
  gains were made by the islands of Vaitupu and Nanumaga. Fongafale itself had
  gained 4.6 hectares in the past four decades, even as the locals were watching
  both tips of the islet being eroded before their eyes. In 2018, Kench
  published another paper with two other researchers, which is the most
  comprehensive analysis of Tuvalu’s coastal changes. The paper showed that 73
  of the 101 islets analysed had accreted surface area amounting to 80.7 
  hectares. The remaining 28 had eroded, losing 7.24 hectares in total. These
  changes happen through a combination of factors. The reef is continuing to
  produce sediment, Kench told me, and the waves are continuing to deposit
  crusts of reef that break away from the vast rim. Kench’s work has been used
  by conservative thinktanks and climate change deniers – or what Kench refers
  to as “that idiotic part of society” – to raise doubts about sea level rise.
  “You can’t control it,” Kench said, with the weariness of a man who has for
  years been dealing with such misinformation. “You can’t control what those
  maniacs do.” Kench does not dispute that sea levels are rising and that this
  is a result of human-made climate breakdown. But he maintains that when it
  comes to atoll islands, “a lot of the gloom and doom scenarios are based on
  emotive, or intuitive, reasoning.” When I asked Kofe about Kench’s work, he
  said that the government finds it “inconclusive”. Kench can appreciate the
  tricky spot Tuvalu finds itself in, but he feels his work could have been used
  differently. “We got a lot of criticism,” he said, “because it didn’t really
  show what they wanted it to.” The government of Tuvalu accused him, Kench told
  me, “of undermining Tuvalu’s international negotiations”. He was surprised by
  the vehemence of the reaction. “They could have said, ‘We are going be living
  here in our country, but our lands are changing around us in ways that we are
  only starting to understand, and we are going to need a lot of help.’” But
  that does not make for, Kench admitted, “a sexy headline”. Kench emphasised to
  me that he was not an expert on habitability. “Land is only one part of that
  metric,” he told me. “I stick to my lane.” But he is astonished by how little
  attention has been given to the physical islands amid the rising sea. “Over
  the last 30 years, agencies have been very happy to spend hundreds of millions
  [of dollars] in measuring sea level rise,” Kench said. “But they’ve spent zero
  on actually measuring the thing that they keep saying is going to disappear
  because of sea level rise.” * * * I went to see Fualifeke, a tiny islet at the
  top of the forehead on Isala’s map, which has gone through a strange mutation
  over the past few decades. While its shore had been severely eroded on the
  lagoon side, it had gained almost the same amount of ground on the sea side.
  Getting to the outer islets is not easy. There are no boats waiting in the
  lagoon to ferry you about. A day before the trip, I had to find someone with a
  boat and then hope for good weather. Lotoala set it up. But on the day we were
  supposed to leave, he told me that though we had the boat, the man who had
  promised to take us couldn’t be found. We decided to go for a few hours
  anyway. It was a burning hot afternoon, though the temperature was only 30C.
  It was not the sticky heat of New Delhi, where I lived for a decade in summer
  temperatures of over 40C, but equally sapping. Sun shone in a blue sky; clouds
  streaked the horizon. We poured water on the aluminium surface of the boat for
  a few minutes before sitting down. There was no padding on the seats, and the
  bare surface would have scalded the skin. When we were done dousing, Lotoala
  sat on the bow, his cousin at the stern. I was joined in the middle by the
  students from Hong Kong and Krishna, the Indian sexologist. The lagoon water
  was comparatively placid, but our small boat was soon seesawing as it moved
  across patches of emerald and cobalt water. When frigate birds flew by the
  boat, my co-passengers hooted with excitement. When we reached the islet after
  about half an hour, there was one house, a few hundred coconut trees and a
  dazzling bank made up of what looked like white gravel, but turned out to be
  tiny, pearly bits of coral reef. We swam in some shallow patches of water but
  only for a few minutes. The heat was exhausting. I saw the Hong Kong students
  clamber out of the warm water, squinting. The bleached reef was impossible to
  stand on without footwear. We all walked into the trees to find sand and
  shade. Everyone took long breaths and drank from a tank that collected
  rainwater. Lotoala climbed a sloping trunk with a big knife and tossed down
  green coconuts. Each of us had many coconuts. We poured cool, sweet water into
  our mouths, then cut them open to scrape out the flesh inside. We sat down,
  facing the sea, and Lotoala happily pointed out where the shape of the island
  had changed. He said that the area covered by chip stones in front of us was
  not there until a few years ago. “It just happens,” he said, enjoying the
  incomprehension on my face. The previous day, we had talked about the
  projections of Tuvalu’s submersion: “I don’t know if it will,” he said. “You
  can never be sure about nature.” On our way back, no one spoke a word, the
  heat had drained us. I could easily recognise Fongafale from miles away, with
  a dark trail of smoke rising from the garbage dump, into the blue sky. When we
  came back to the lodge, Lotoala told me that when he was growing up, the heat
  wasn’t this bad. He was wagging his finger at the airstrip, which was baking
  under the sun without a patch of shade. “We used to play there in the
  afternoons.” The heat is worse on Fongafale than perhaps any other islet of
  Funafuti, he said, primarily because of the airstrip: no other atoll has so
  great an area of asphalt exposed to the sun. Everyone complains passionately
  about the rising temperature. When I took a walk one afternoon, the heat
  pinned me down within minutes and seemed to rise out of the ground. The sun
  was directly above, shadows were small, and Fongafale had the look of a ghost
  town. People had receded indoors. Hapless tourists stood by the side of the
  road waving at the occasional passing moped, requesting a lift to their
  accommodation. When I crossed the white-hot airstrip, where Lotoala used to
  kick a football at this hour, I wondered if the rubber soles of my sandals
  were sticking to the ground. In the restaurant at the lodge, Lotoala found me
  gulping down water and sweating profusely. He laughed heartily when I
  explained, and said: “Boss, you do not take a walk at 2pm!” The heat, Lotoala
  believes, might make it impossible to live in Funafuti long before water takes
  over the land. His mother, sitting nearby, nodded in agreement. * * * I had
  arrived in Tuvalu at the time of a national election, hoping to find the usual
  ferment around the time of voting. But the election means a lull in Fongafale.
  The ferry to the outer islands wasn’t running, the government building was
  empty, and there were no rallies or speeches. Tuvalu has no political parties.
  The cabinet is made up of two representatives from each of the eight inhabited
  islands, who vote for a prime minister among them. All candidates had returned
  to the islands, and the sofas in the lobby of the government building, which
  has decent internet, were occupied by kids spending their afternoons playing
  games on their smartphones. While voting was ongoing at different community
  halls in Fongafale, a group of young men were downing cans of Filipino beer in
  a yard by a small house. I joined them. They were a boisterous bunch, who had
  attended high school or university in New Zealand and Australia. When I told
  them I was from India, they wanted to know how to pronounce the names of some
  Indian cricketers who had recently toured Auckland and Sydney. It delighted
  them that I could name the cricket grounds in those cities; one of them, who
  had studied in Brisbane, broke out in a little dance when I said: “the Gabba!”
  With glazed eyes, they told me about the tall buildings, the glittering
  streets, the nightlife. Everything about those cities gladdened them and they
  spoke of their time there with longing and excitement. They wanted to go back,
  but they weren’t sure how. Unlike Lotoala, who runs his own lodge, or Grace,
  who works with the government, these men, like many others in Tuvalu, hear the
  siren song of the great cities of Oceania, which present them with
  opportunities for a life that is not accessible to them in Fongafale. This
  yearning exhibits itself in the thousands of people who apply each year for
  the Pacific Access Category visa which has granted 75 Tuvaluans residential
  rights in New Zealand each year since 2019. In 2023, Tuvalu signed the
  Falepili Union treaty with Australia, which stipulated “a special human
  mobility pathway for citizens of Tuvalu” to migrate to Australia and millions
  of dollars in aid; in exchange, Tuvalu must consult on defence and security
  matters before engaging with other nations. When signed, in November 2023, the
  treaty was seen as an overture by the United States to counter China’s
  investments in the Pacific states, like Vanuatu. But the part of the treaty
  that most concerned locals was that Australia will award 280 Tuvaluans
  residential visas every year through a ballot system, and the beneficiaries
  will receive the same health, education, housing, and employment rights
  enjoyed by Australian citizens. Additionally, Tuvaluans will retain the
  ability to return to their home country. It has been publicised as a “climate
  visa” by the international press, but the reasons for the widespread appeal of
  immigration are also economic. When I called Lotoala in August, he told me
  that he wasn’t among the Tuvaluans who had applied for the Australian visa,
  but he wasn’t surprised that every third person in Tuvalu wants to “have this
  opportunity”. “I have a business,” he told me. “I can work here and feed my
  family and live a comfortable life. But maybe 1% of people here, 100 families,
  can afford such a life. What we earn is not what normal people earn. Most
  people have no way to make money. Most work you can find pays A$5 per hour.”
  Lotoala mentioned that over the past months, tourists from the US and Europe
  have expressed to him their shock at the prices of daily essentials in the
  shops. “Even we feel the pressure every now and then,” he added. “Life here
  can get very tough.” Lotoala said that more and more people are feeling
  “stuck” in Tuvalu. Moving to Australia, or New Zealand for that matter, seems
  like a way out. “If I didn’t have a business, I’d take my family to Australia,
  find a job and level up from there,” he said. “It is like a new opportunity,
  to build a new life.” Reporting for this story was supported by the Joan

In November 2022, Simon Kofe, then foreign minister of the island nation of Tuvalu, announced a sensational plan for his country’s survival. Climate breakdown poses an existential threat to small island-nations in the Pacific, but Tuvalu’s geography makes it especially vulnerable. The highest point of elevation in the country is 4.5 metres. If the water rises, there is no hill to run to. In the past four decades, local sea level has risen twice as fast as the global average. By 2050, the government expects half of the capital, Funafuti, to be flooded by tidal waters. By the end of the century, more than 90% of the land could be submerged. “As our land disappears, we have no choice but to become the world’s first digital nation,” Kofe declared in a video address to delegates at the UN climate conference Cop27. In the background was an islet of Funafuti, Te Afualiku. “Islands like this one won’t survive,” Kofe said. Then came the twist: “So, we will recreate them virtually.” Organ music swelled, the camera zoomed out, and the image of Kofe standing on the island flickered like a glitch in a video game. The leaves of the trees behind Kofe were bathed in sunlight, but as the view widened, the sky was revealed as a black void: Kofe was delivering his address from a digital rendition of the islet. As he continued his speech, the camera went higher, as if on a drone, and Kofe became smaller and smaller. Frigate birds circled above him, signifying bad weather. “Without a global conscience and a global commitment to our shared wellbeing,” Kofe continued, “we may soon find the rest of the world joining us online, as their lands disappear.” As an advertisement to draw attention to Tuvalu’s grim predicament, it was designed to shock. The words Kofe spoke had been polished by an Australian creative agency affiliated with Accenture. They generated a tremendous market response: travel vloggers began to descend on the “sinking nation”, followed by country-counting tourists who wanted to get a glimpse before it disappears. The idea of a virtual future for Tuvalu generated frenzied commentary. By creating a digital clone of the islands, a headline in the Guardian pondered, could we not “preserve the island nation before it’s lost to the collapsing climate?” The Sydney Morning Herald reported, “Tuvalu turns to metaverse to guarantee its existence.” The video won an award at the Cannes Lions international festival of creativity, beating ads for Mastercard and Budweiser. Adweek reported on the “award-winning metaverse project that’s saving a nation”. This was a time when the US media was producing two articles a day about the metaverse: it was going to “shape our future”, it was the “future of connection”, it was “reality beyond fantasy”. It also became something that might save poor Tuvalu from extinction. Yet this outlandish idea sidestepped the most basic question posed by Tuvalu’s possible submersion: where are the people going to go? Last year, I flew from New York to Fiji, which provides the only aerial connection to Tuvalu, to find out how Tuvaluans felt about the future that the government had imagined for them. * * * Spread 420 miles across the western Pacific, halfway between Australia and Hawaii, Tuvalu is made up of nine islands, six of which are atolls. Funafuti is an atoll, consisting of 33 individual islets. Their combined surface area is smaller than Central Park, and the lagoon they surround is spread over 103 sq miles. From the window of a low-flying, 68-seat aircraft that flies three times a week to Tuvalu from Fiji, I could only see a part of the atoll, not the whole ring. There were no tall structures visible, no sprawl of cement and no bridges connecting the islets, some of which are completely covered in a huddle of treetops. The population of Tuvalu is just over 11,000 and more than half of the people live on a single islet of Funafuti, called Fongafale. It is a sliver of land eight miles long, with a small airstrip near the centre. After my plane landed, it came to a stop in front of a small airport building. Going through immigration, customs and the exit took about five minutes. Filamona Lodge, one of the four lodging options in the country, where I had booked a room, was less than 100 metres away. It was a two-storey house, in which more than a dozen rooms had been carved out with thin walls. The upper floor was made of planks of wood. The owner-family lived in the back. The open-air restaurant was almost full when I arrived, because the airport has no lounge, and the departing passengers come here to sit, wait and sweat after checking in their luggage. Metia Lotoala, a 30-year-old father of three, with buzzed hair, a goatee and a look of perpetual amusement on his face, showed me to my room. Lotoala grew up in Tuvalu and his family owns the lodge. My room was slightly bigger than the others but the best part, Lotoala told me, was that it was adjacent to a balcony, which overlooked the airstrip. In the evening, I realised what he meant. The widest open area on the islet, the airstrip is an essential part of daily life. After 5pm, when the temperature climbed down, it transformed into a town square. Soccer goalposts and volleyball nets were brought out and placed on the runway. Young men dashed about in trainers and shorts; old men watched them sitting cross-legged on their mopeds. Families laid out picnics on mats made by weaving the leaves of the pandanus tree, which, along with pukas and coconuts, line the edge of the airstrip. At 6.45pm, under an indigo sky, church bells rang out along the main street and all movement on the islet came to a halt. Those walking back home stopped by the side of the streets, mopeds and cars turned off their engines. Like many island-nations in the Pacific, Tuvalu is devoutly Christian. Every evening, 15 minutes are reserved for prayer time. By the side of a road that runs along the airstrip, I chatted with a police officer who had asked me to stop and wait. She told me that there are 132 police personnel in the country, and the last notable crime took place in 2015, when a drunk motorcycle rider ran over someone who was sleeping the night at the airstrip. Sleeping at the airstrip used to be common practice and continues to be permitted; since the accident, cars and mopeds have been banned. Night descended quickly and by 7pm it was dark. Back at the lodge, the plastic chairs of the restaurant were occupied by a couple from Peru, two college students from Hong Kong and an Indian sexologist. A story I heard there, later confirmed by Lotoala, was about a tourist who arrived a few weeks earlier, spent about an hour walking about, then bought a return ticket, and flew back on the same flight he had come on. The tourists I met had been flying around the Pacific and were all heading to their next destination in a couple of days. No one felt they hadn’t spent enough time, no one said they’d be coming back. After a dinner of chicken soup, I asked what had brought them here, to one of the least visited countries in the world. MR Krishna, the Indian sexologist, told me he had come “to see Tuvalu before it disappears”. * * * A couple of days later, I went to see Simon Kofe. He was almost defensive when I asked him about the Cop27 address. “Everything I said in my speech was backed by science,” he told me, sitting in the porch of his lagoon-facing house, where the video was filmed on a green screen. “If our statehood is permanent and we lose our physical territory, a digital nation is going to be the representation of the sovereign state of Tuvalu.” Kofe reminded me that he had “never used the word ‘metaverse’” in his address. He was surprised to see that “that’s what everyone ran with”. Media outlets, especially those covering technology, have portrayed Tuvalu as a country leaping into a digital future, but in terms of internet accessibility, landing in Tuvalu felt like time-travelling to the mid-2000s. No international telecommunications service has coverage here. The only way to connect to the internet was to buy a sim card from the office of Tuvalu telecom, which opens for a few hours every weekday. A woman handed me a sim card after noting down, by hand, the details of my passport in a long register. The sim card offered 2G speed and sketchy network. It cost more than $10 for two gigabytes of data, and I was unable to load a YouTube clip of Kofe’s famous address. I was told that a few houses had set up Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet connection, but it is far out of the financial reach of most locals. In a bid to counter China’s overtures in the region, Japan, Australia and Taiwan, led by the United States, are working out a plan to connect several Pacific states with an undersea internet cable, but completion is years away. “First we will have to bring the internet,” Kofe told me. “It is not something that will happen overnight.” In 2023, the government of Tuvalu amended its constitution to note that “the state of Tuvalu … shall remain in perpetuity in the future”, irrespective “of climate change or other causes resulting in loss to the physical territory”. Since then, Tuvalu has managed to get more than a dozen bilateral partners, including New Zealand and Australia, to formally acknowledge its permanent statehood. The idea has unanimous appeal, and acceptance, across the region, where several other countries’ boundaries are similarly threatened by the climate crisis. In international law, a state is traditionally defined as an entity with four attributes: a permanent population, a defined territory, a government, and the capacity to form relationships with other states. Submersion means Tuvalu will fail to meet the first two criteria. And with this, come other tricky questions. The sale of fishing licences contributes almost half of Tuvalu’s national income – would an underwater but online Tuvalu retain these territorial rights over maritime territory? The government has taken steps, by amending its constitution and securing bilateral agreements, to secure its future sovereignty over the waters – but this may have far-reaching implications for international law, and the commonly understood meaning of statehood itself. “Statehood is a fiction, a legal fiction that we came up with,” says Sumudu Atapattu, the director of the Global Legal Studies Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison law school. In this century, as the climate crisis will scramble the commonly understood meanings of nationhood and sovereignty, the world is going to have to come up with, in Atapattu’s words, “a new fiction”. Digital statehood is an attempt at this redefinition, but at this stage the details are unknown. Recent bilateral agreements with New Zealand and Australia provide residential visas to a few hundred Tuvaluans each year to move to those countries, but a far greater number of locals aspire to emigrate than the 355 who receive these visas every year. In June, when applications opened for the first time for 280 Australian visas to be allocated to Tuvaluans, more than 8,000 people applied. But at the current rate, it will take more than 30 years for everyone to leave Tuvalu, by which time Funafuti, according to government estimates, might be underwater. * * * Grace Malie grew up in Fongafale. For high school she moved to Vaitupu, the largest atoll of Tuvalu, where just over 1,000 people live. Students from all the other islands attend Motufoua secondary school while living with local families in Vaitupu. Malie told me she learned the local dances, faatele in Tuvaluan, from all the eight inhabited islands of Tuvalu, each of which has distinct linguistic dialects and customs. Later, she went to study at the University of the South Pacific in Fiji, moved back to Fongafale, and worked briefly as an assistant to Kofe. In 2023, at the age of 24, Malie visited Cop28 in Dubai as a youth delegate. “I find it kind of hard to accept when I ask people where they are from, and they say, ‘New York’, and I say, ‘The big city!’” she told me. “But when I say, ‘I’m from Tuvalu’, they’re like, ‘Where?’, and I say, ‘In the Pacific’, and they’re like, ‘Where?’, then I say, ‘You know Australia? Hawaii? Yeah. Somewhere in between there.’” Malie said that the people she was talking to probably couldn’t even imagine what Tuvalu looks like. Malie appreciated how Kofe’s speeches were changing that. But she was also disturbed by the image of the virtual islet where Kofe was standing in the 2022 video. “The visuals are for people who are not living here to be able to see, and for us, it is like …” Without finishing that sentence, Malie popped her eyes and retreated into her chair behind outstretched hands. Was it scary to watch? I asked. “Yes,” Malie said. “It brought the reality closer to home.” I met Malie shortly after she had returned from Cop28 with her friend Tamala Pita, who was sitting with us at the restaurant of Filamona Lodge. As youth delegates, Malie and Pita told me, it was exhausting to talk about erosion, submersion, migration and weave it together with their personal experiences. “It was emotional,” Malie said. “You are talking about losing your home to these strangers, and you think about what you are saying, and you start crying, it is just emotionally draining.” Both Malie and Pita broke down several times during the nine days in Dubai; they consoled each other and were consoled by youth delegates from other developing nations. Both were stunned by the excessive, needless use of indoor lighting and air-conditioning. Pita said: “There were lights on the floor of the metro station! I was like, do you really need that?” Whenever Malie is away, she is always thinking of returning. I asked her what she misses when she is travelling. “Ohh,” she said, letting her shoulders droop. Then, with a burst of energy: “Everything! Being able to sleep with your door open, the wind coming into the house, there is no homelessness here, there is no stress.” Many houses in Tuvalu have openings on all sides, with sloping roofs made of thatch or corrugated iron. Generally, the house is one big hall, where the family sleeps on mattresses on the floor. The bedding is rolled up and put in a corner in the morning, and the hall becomes the living room. What is it like to consider, I asked Malie, that Tuvalu might become uninhabitable in her lifetime. “We need to convey that possibility, but we also want to try to make sure that doesn’t actually happen to us,” she said. It is a difficult balance. Tuvalu is walking a fine line: to get the attention of the world, it must publicise its own disappearance, while doing everything it can to survive. The government of Tuvalu is reclaiming land on the lagoon side, with funds from the UN. That gives Malie hope. So does her religious faith. “We always have journalists coming up and talking about these scientific facts, but then we have to remain true to our fight and our cause and our people, and we have remained resilient and remained hopeful,” she told me. “We’ve said this so many times, but the motto of Tuvalu is ‘Tuvalu mo te Atua’, which means, Tuvalu with God.” * * * Until recently, Tuvalu was best known for its fortuitous top-level domain – .tv. In 1995, a government office in Fongafale received a fax, informing them that Tuvalu’s country code on the world wide web had been assigned. The government officials gathered around the fax, one recalled in 2019, and wondered: “What the hell is this internet thing?” Before long, video platforms wanted URLs ending in .tv, and Tuvalu cashed in. Every streaming company running a website address that ends in .tv, from Amazon to Apple to Hulu to Twitch, pays a licensing fee. Last year, it contributed more than $10m to the country’s $80m revenue. Besides the licences for tuna fishing in its territorial waters, which amount to about $35m, .tv is Tuvalu’s second-largest source of income. Before it became independent in 1978, Tuvalu had been under British rule for almost a century. When independence was looming, it was important to Tuvaluans to not be merged with the Gilbert islands, which became Kiribati. Tito Isala, a septuagenarian with curly white hair, who was part of the committee that negotiated the terms of independence in the 1970s and lived with his wife a few houses down the road from my lodge, told me that Kiribati, which has a surface area of 300 sq miles, would have “swallowed little Tuvalu”. They decided to become an independent country comprising nine atolls, eight of which were inhabited, and adopted the name Tuvalu, which in Tuvaluan means eight standing together. Today, Fongafale, on its less than one sq mile of land, houses more than 6,000 people, and offers them few services. There was no ATM in the country until a few months ago. There are no barbershops; people cut their own hair or wait till their next visit to Fiji. A small garden run by a Taiwanese aid agency is the only source of fresh produce. A bag of vegetables can be bought once or twice a week, at $13 each. Locals catch fish in the lagoon, which is the only source of fresh meat in the country besides pork; neither is available in plenty. The population is sustained by imported food. A supermarket, a warehouse really, near the north end of the airstrip, accounts for more than 70% of the country’s imports. It sells butter manufactured in California, Japanese washing machines, and sofas of unspecified origins; this is also where everyone buys vegetables, grain and meat. Sacks of rice are piled in one corner. Imported, processed food has disturbed the diet. A quarter of Tuvalu’s population has diabetes. Tuvalu, according to the UN, is among the world’s least-developed countries. On the northern end of Fongafale, just before the point where Kofe made his famous address, there is a huge garbage dump – among the tallest structures on the island – which sometimes combusts spontaneously. On the southern end is a rusted warship, and the stony beach is covered in broken glass and plastic bottles, torn clothes and washed-up Blundstone boots. People who live here feel deeply connected to the place, but even they concede that to see how beautiful Tuvalu is, one must get out of Fongafale, and go to the outer islands. “Too many people live here, that’s the problem,” Lotoala, the motel owner, said to me. One evening in the balcony next to my room, I asked Lotoala what he thought about the threat posed by the climate crisis to Tuvalu. “Do you mean that the islands might drown?” he asked me. When I said yes, he responded: “I don’t think it will happen.” With a boyish, confessional smile, he added: “People don’t like you when you say that. But I don’t think it will happen.” He knew that when the tides run high, around March every year, water seeps through the ground in Fongafale. “But it only happens at that one place,” he said. “It has been happening there since I was a kid.” Lotoala believes that it will be “hundreds” of years before the islands are fully submerged, but he knows that it will become increasingly difficult to continue to live here. “This is what I tell my children: you have to think about moving, about being flexible, you have to have that mindset, you should not get stuck here.” The idea of submersion is not convincing to all the locals. They have seen the erosion of Fongafale before their eyes and are acutely aware of the changing climate, but at the same time, they have also seen atolls grow and gain ground. Tito Isala dismissed all talk of a digital future with a wave of his hand: “It is defeatist, hopeless.” Nor was he excited about the idea of Tuvaluans settling on foreign shores. “We do not want to relocate,” he said. “Where are we going to go? New Zealand?” Isala said. “How do they treat the Māori?” He gave me another hypothetical. “America? Who wants to deal with their Trumps and Bidens?” Isala opened an iron chest in his living room and pulled out a large, laminated, navigational map of Funafuti. He unrolled it on the top of the trunk. “The islets make the shape of a human face in profile; we are here, at the back of the head,” he said, pointing to Fongafale. “Here we have lost land.” Then he pointed to the chin on the map, at an islet of Funafuti called Motuloa. “Motuloa has grown its landmass,” Isala said. * * * The local understanding of the adaptability of the atolls is backed up by some scientific data. When Malie had told me submersion “is a possibility”, she wasn’t simply dismissing the projections of sea level rise by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “The signs are very clear, especially from the IPCC reports,” Malie said. “But then you have other science, which is uncertain, which says it [submersion] might happen, it might not happen.” This “other science” is mainly based on the work of Paul Kench, a coastal geomorphologist who has studied shoreline changes in the Maldives, Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the Great Barrier Reef, Kiribati and Tuvalu. Kench studied coastal changes and physical geography of islands at the University of Auckland, then did his PhD at the University of New South Wales, where his dissertation was on atolls in the Indian Ocean. When we spoke on Zoom, Kench was in Singapore, where he is a professor in the department of geography at the National University. Kench has amassed a significant body of work to show that rising sea level does not necessarily mean the submersion of low-lying atolls. The projections of Tuvalu’s disappearance assume that atoll islands are static structures. Kench’s work shows that they are instead dynamic entities that are constantly transforming themselves, even gaining landmass. Using data from aerial images going back to the second world war, Kench showed that in the past four decades, while sea level rose in Tuvalu twice as fast the global average, total land area slightly increased, by 2.9%. The greatest gains were made by the islands of Vaitupu and Nanumaga. Fongafale itself had gained 4.6 hectares in the past four decades, even as the locals were watching both tips of the islet being eroded before their eyes. In 2018, Kench published another paper with two other researchers, which is the most comprehensive analysis of Tuvalu’s coastal changes. The paper showed that 73 of the 101 islets analysed had accreted surface area amounting to 80.7  hectares. The remaining 28 had eroded, losing 7.24 hectares in total. These changes happen through a combination of factors. The reef is continuing to produce sediment, Kench told me, and the waves are continuing to deposit crusts of reef that break away from the vast rim. Kench’s work has been used by conservative thinktanks and climate change deniers – or what Kench refers to as “that idiotic part of society” – to raise doubts about sea level rise. “You can’t control it,” Kench said, with the weariness of a man who has for years been dealing with such misinformation. “You can’t control what those maniacs do.” Kench does not dispute that sea levels are rising and that this is a result of human-made climate breakdown. But he maintains that when it comes to atoll islands, “a lot of the gloom and doom scenarios are based on emotive, or intuitive, reasoning.” When I asked Kofe about Kench’s work, he said that the government finds it “inconclusive”. Kench can appreciate the tricky spot Tuvalu finds itself in, but he feels his work could have been used differently. “We got a lot of criticism,” he said, “because it didn’t really show what they wanted it to.” The government of Tuvalu accused him, Kench told me, “of undermining Tuvalu’s international negotiations”. He was surprised by the vehemence of the reaction. “They could have said, ‘We are going be living here in our country, but our lands are changing around us in ways that we are only starting to understand, and we are going to need a lot of help.’” But that does not make for, Kench admitted, “a sexy headline”. Kench emphasised to me that he was not an expert on habitability. “Land is only one part of that metric,” he told me. “I stick to my lane.” But he is astonished by how little attention has been given to the physical islands amid the rising sea. “Over the last 30 years, agencies have been very happy to spend hundreds of millions [of dollars] in measuring sea level rise,” Kench said. “But they’ve spent zero on actually measuring the thing that they keep saying is going to disappear because of sea level rise.” * * * I went to see Fualifeke, a tiny islet at the top of the forehead on Isala’s map, which has gone through a strange mutation over the past few decades. While its shore had been severely eroded on the lagoon side, it had gained almost the same amount of ground on the sea side. Getting to the outer islets is not easy. There are no boats waiting in the lagoon to ferry you about. A day before the trip, I had to find someone with a boat and then hope for good weather. Lotoala set it up. But on the day we were supposed to leave, he told me that though we had the boat, the man who had promised to take us couldn’t be found. We decided to go for a few hours anyway. It was a burning hot afternoon, though the temperature was only 30C. It was not the sticky heat of New Delhi, where I lived for a decade in summer temperatures of over 40C, but equally sapping. Sun shone in a blue sky; clouds streaked the horizon. We poured water on the aluminium surface of the boat for a few minutes before sitting down. There was no padding on the seats, and the bare surface would have scalded the skin. When we were done dousing, Lotoala sat on the bow, his cousin at the stern. I was joined in the middle by the students from Hong Kong and Krishna, the Indian sexologist. The lagoon water was comparatively placid, but our small boat was soon seesawing as it moved across patches of emerald and cobalt water. When frigate birds flew by the boat, my co-passengers hooted with excitement. When we reached the islet after about half an hour, there was one house, a few hundred coconut trees and a dazzling bank made up of what looked like white gravel, but turned out to be tiny, pearly bits of coral reef. We swam in some shallow patches of water but only for a few minutes. The heat was exhausting. I saw the Hong Kong students clamber out of the warm water, squinting. The bleached reef was impossible to stand on without footwear. We all walked into the trees to find sand and shade. Everyone took long breaths and drank from a tank that collected rainwater. Lotoala climbed a sloping trunk with a big knife and tossed down green coconuts. Each of us had many coconuts. We poured cool, sweet water into our mouths, then cut them open to scrape out the flesh inside. We sat down, facing the sea, and Lotoala happily pointed out where the shape of the island had changed. He said that the area covered by chip stones in front of us was not there until a few years ago. “It just happens,” he said, enjoying the incomprehension on my face. The previous day, we had talked about the projections of Tuvalu’s submersion: “I don’t know if it will,” he said. “You can never be sure about nature.” On our way back, no one spoke a word, the heat had drained us. I could easily recognise Fongafale from miles away, with a dark trail of smoke rising from the garbage dump, into the blue sky. When we came back to the lodge, Lotoala told me that when he was growing up, the heat wasn’t this bad. He was wagging his finger at the airstrip, which was baking under the sun without a patch of shade. “We used to play there in the afternoons.” The heat is worse on Fongafale than perhaps any other islet of Funafuti, he said, primarily because of the airstrip: no other atoll has so great an area of asphalt exposed to the sun. Everyone complains passionately about the rising temperature. When I took a walk one afternoon, the heat pinned me down within minutes and seemed to rise out of the ground. The sun was directly above, shadows were small, and Fongafale had the look of a ghost town. People had receded indoors. Hapless tourists stood by the side of the road waving at the occasional passing moped, requesting a lift to their accommodation. When I crossed the white-hot airstrip, where Lotoala used to kick a football at this hour, I wondered if the rubber soles of my sandals were sticking to the ground. In the restaurant at the lodge, Lotoala found me gulping down water and sweating profusely. He laughed heartily when I explained, and said: “Boss, you do not take a walk at 2pm!” The heat, Lotoala believes, might make it impossible to live in Funafuti long before water takes over the land. His mother, sitting nearby, nodded in agreement. * * * I had arrived in Tuvalu at the time of a national election, hoping to find the usual ferment around the time of voting. But the election means a lull in Fongafale. The ferry to the outer islands wasn’t running, the government building was empty, and there were no rallies or speeches. Tuvalu has no political parties. The cabinet is made up of two representatives from each of the eight inhabited islands, who vote for a prime minister among them. All candidates had returned to the islands, and the sofas in the lobby of the government building, which has decent internet, were occupied by kids spending their afternoons playing games on their smartphones. While voting was ongoing at different community halls in Fongafale, a group of young men were downing cans of Filipino beer in a yard by a small house. I joined them. They were a boisterous bunch, who had attended high school or university in New Zealand and Australia. When I told them I was from India, they wanted to know how to pronounce the names of some Indian cricketers who had recently toured Auckland and Sydney. It delighted them that I could name the cricket grounds in those cities; one of them, who had studied in Brisbane, broke out in a little dance when I said: “the Gabba!” With glazed eyes, they told me about the tall buildings, the glittering streets, the nightlife. Everything about those cities gladdened them and they spoke of their time there with longing and excitement. They wanted to go back, but they weren’t sure how. Unlike Lotoala, who runs his own lodge, or Grace, who works with the government, these men, like many others in Tuvalu, hear the siren song of the great cities of Oceania, which present them with opportunities for a life that is not accessible to them in Fongafale. This yearning exhibits itself in the thousands of people who apply each year for the Pacific Access Category visa which has granted 75 Tuvaluans residential rights in New Zealand each year since 2019. In 2023, Tuvalu signed the Falepili Union treaty with Australia, which stipulated “a special human mobility pathway for citizens of Tuvalu” to migrate to Australia and millions of dollars in aid; in exchange, Tuvalu must consult on defence and security matters before engaging with other nations. When signed, in November 2023, the treaty was seen as an overture by the United States to counter China’s investments in the Pacific states, like Vanuatu. But the part of the treaty that most concerned locals was that Australia will award 280 Tuvaluans residential visas every year through a ballot system, and the beneficiaries will receive the same health, education, housing, and employment rights enjoyed by Australian citizens. Additionally, Tuvaluans will retain the ability to return to their home country. It has been publicised as a “climate visa” by the international press, but the reasons for the widespread appeal of immigration are also economic. When I called Lotoala in August, he told me that he wasn’t among the Tuvaluans who had applied for the Australian visa, but he wasn’t surprised that every third person in Tuvalu wants to “have this opportunity”. “I have a business,” he told me. “I can work here and feed my family and live a comfortable life. But maybe 1% of people here, 100 families, can afford such a life. What we earn is not what normal people earn. Most people have no way to make money. Most work you can find pays A$5 per hour.” Lotoala mentioned that over the past months, tourists from the US and Europe have expressed to him their shock at the prices of daily essentials in the shops. “Even we feel the pressure every now and then,” he added. “Life here can get very tough.” Lotoala said that more and more people are feeling “stuck” in Tuvalu. Moving to Australia, or New Zealand for that matter, seems like a way out. “If I didn’t have a business, I’d take my family to Australia, find a job and level up from there,” he said. “It is like a new opportunity, to build a new life.” Reporting for this story was supported by the Joan Konner Program in the Journalism of Ideas. • Listen to our podcasts and sign up to the long read weekly email.
