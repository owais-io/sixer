  Plastic bag sales have risen for the first time in 10 years on the back of the
  so-called Ocado effect as online food shops and ultra-fast deliveries replace
  supermarket trips. Shoppers in England bought 437m single-use plastic carrier
  bags last year, compared with 407m the year before, a rise of 7%, according to
  data from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It is the first
  time sales have gone up since 2015, when the government introduced a 5p charge
  on single-use plastic bags in England. The 5p charge was paused during the
  pandemic but rose to 10p in 2021. The waste charity Wrap told the Sunday
  Times, which first reported the figures, that the growth of online grocery
  shopping and the way orders were packed had contributed to the increase in bag
  sales. Ocado sold more plastic bags than any other supermarket, at 221m, an
  increase of 30m on 2023, which the company put down to having more customers.
  Co-op was in second place, at 94m, although the retailer pointed out that its
  carrier bags are 100% compostable. Morrisons sold 58m and Sainsbury’s 11m.
  Both Ocado and Morrisons said customers could recycle their bags by giving
  them back to the delivery driver. Ocado said 89% of customers did this to get
  a refund ; the Morrisons return rate is 88%. Although the introduction of a
  levy led to a sharp fall in sales of plastic bags, from more than 7.6bn, there
  are concerns that the data indicates the country is moving in the wrong
  direction. The rise in plastic bags sales comes amid broader worries about
  plastic pollution. The amount of plastic waste collected on beaches rose by
  9.5% in 2024 compared with 2023, according to a report by the Marine
  Conservation Society. The report found that nearly half (46%) of plastic waste
  was from public sources, with household litter washing into seas through
  rivers, drainage and sewage outlets, or blown or dropped on to the coastline.
  Sainsbury’s, which sold an additional 2.5m bags in 2024, said the rise was
  because of the growth in “on-demand” deliveries through apps such as Just Eat.
  It has switched to using paper bags so it expects single-use bag sales to drop
  sharply. A Morrisons spokesperson said that in more than 50% of postcodes it
  now delivers groceries in a small crate, which the customer unpacks and hands
  back to the driver on the doorstep. A Defra spokesperson said the government
  was “committed to cutting our reliance on plastics and figures since the ban
  came into force show the plastic bag charge is effective”.
