  West Ham have submitted a bid for Monaco’s Soungoutou Magassa and are pushing
  to complete a deal for the Monaco midfielder. Graham Potter is looking to make
  two additions in midfield and is moving ahead with his plans after an
  agreement was reached for Edson Álvarez to join Fenerbahce on loan. Talks are
  taking place between West Ham and the Turkish club regarding the final details
  of a deal for the Mexico international. Targeting the 21-year-old Magassa is a
  sign of West Ham’s desire to add youth and energy to their squad. He made 29
  appearances in all competitions for Monaco last season, playing in the
  Champions League, and represented France Under-21s at this summer’s European
  Championship. West Ham see Magassa as a filling a slot in defensive midfield.
  They want to add more power and need someone to set the tempo and control play
  from deep positions. Potter is also targeting a No 8 and has tried to sign
  Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes. West Ham are also monitoring Rennes’ Djaoui
  Cissé, Werder Bremen’s Romano Schmid, Feyernoord’s Quinten Timber, Ajax’s
  Kenneth Taylor and Torino’s Ivan Ilic. The Lens midfielder Andy Diouf is
  expected to join Inter. Besiktas have tabled an offer for the Italy left-back
  Emerson Palmieri, who is surplus to requirements following the signing of El
  Hadji Malick Diouf.
