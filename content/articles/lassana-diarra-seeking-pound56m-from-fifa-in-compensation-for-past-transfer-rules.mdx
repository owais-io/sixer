  Lassana Diarra is to directly pursue Fifa for €65m (£56m) in compensation
  after a European court’s verdict on its transfer rules, with the former France
  midfielder describing a failure by the governing body to reach a settlement as
  indicative of a “culture of contempt”. Diarra provoked significant change in
  the game last year when he won a case at the court of justice of the European
  Union (CJEU) claiming his freedom of movement had been restricted by Fifa
  rules. The European court of justice (ECJ) is part of the CJEU. The
  organisation subsequently amended its rulebook but the one‑time Chelsea player
  says it has failed to make personal amends and, as a result, he is starting
  legal proceedings against it, as well as against the Belgian football
  association. In a statement released through his lawyers, Diarra said: “I have
  been forced to fight this legal battle since August 2014. That’s more than 11
  years! I waited a few months before restarting the national proceedings in
  Belgium, thinking that Fifa and the Belgian federation would at least have the
  decency to approach me to propose an amicable settlement of the dispute … This
  was not the case. That is their right, but it reflects a continuing culture of
  contempt for the rule of law and for players, despite the crystal-clear
  message sent by the CJEU.” Diarra is seeking €65m in compensation for what he
  argues is the damage inflicted by the collapse of his proposed transfer from
  Lokomotiv Moscow to the Belgian side Charleroi in 2014. With his contract
  terminated by the Russian club, Diarra was denied a permit to transfer to
  Charleroi as the rules decreed that he must first pay a fine levied by
  Lokomotiv, as well as compensation determined by a separate legal action. In
  hearing the case last year, the CJEU found that Fifa’s rules in the event of a
  contract being terminated were “contrary to EU law” and that they imposed
  “considerable legal risks, unforeseeable and potentially very high financial
  risks as well as major sporting risks on those players and clubs wishing to
  employ them which, taken together, are such as to impede international
  transfers of those players”. Fifa amended its rules in December in a move
  declared insufficient by the global players’ union, FifPro, which is backing
  Diarra’s latest lawsuit. “The decision to pursue litigation followed
  unsuccessful attempts at amicable settlement, with Fifa declining to engage
  constructively to resolve the rightful demand by the player to be compensated
  for his career losses,” the union said. The news also follows an announcement
  two weeks ago of a class-action lawsuit being brought against Fifa, with
  lawyers estimating that all players during the period the rules were in force
  could have had their lifetime earnings reduced by as much as 8%. Diarra’s
  lawyers, the Belgian firm Dupont-Hissel, who are also behind the Justice for
  Players class action, said they expect a verdict in the case within “12-15
  months”. “I am doing this for myself and if I have been able to hold out
  against the Fifa steamroller, it is because I had a good career,” Diarra said.
  “But I have also done it for all the up and coming, lesser known players who
  do not have the financial and psychological means to challenge Fifa before
  real judges.” In a statement Fifa said: “Since the ECJ issued its ruling in
  the Diarra case in October 2024, Fifa has been working with its stakeholders
  to amend its regulations following the guidance offered by the ECJ. Fifa does
  not comment on ongoing legal matters.”
