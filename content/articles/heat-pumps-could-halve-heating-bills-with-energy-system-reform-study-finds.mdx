  Heat pumps could save households hundreds of pounds a year on heating bills,
  if the government took simple measures to reform the energy system, an
  analysis has found. The average household’s heating bills could be roughly
  halved, saving about £375 a year with a heat pump instead of a gas boiler, if
  steps were taken to make electricity cheaper. These steps include ending green
  levies on electrical heating, reforming how electricity is priced, and taking
  measures to prevent gas power companies from jacking up their profits,
  according to an analysis by the thinktank E3G. Heat pumps, which run on
  electricity, are more efficient than gas boilers and will be essential to
  reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions. However, they are more expensive
  to run in the UK than they need to be, because of the way the UK’s privatised
  energy system is managed. At present, homeowners with heat pumps who are on
  the right tariff and have well-insulated homes should save money. But some
  homeowners who replace gas boilers with electric heat pumps may get no saving,
  or even a cost increase. Their average annual heating bill is likely to be
  about £920, according to E3G, compared with £820 for homes with a gas boiler.
  This discrepancy has held back installations, and led anti-net zero
  campaigners to decry heat pumps and claim that policies to promote them should
  be discarded. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, has publicly voiced disquiet
  on the issue, while the government chief scientist has admitted that the lack
  of cost saving currently seen by some households was a problem. But with a few
  measures, the government could transform the prospects for heat pumps and save
  money for millions of households, the E3G analysis has shown. Shifting the
  green levies that apply to electricity bills rather than gas would save about
  £150 a year for a heat pump household, E3G found. Reforming the electricity
  system, under which the price of electricity is frequently dependent on the
  cost at which the highest-priced gas-fired power station is generating, would
  save about £90 a year on average. Currently, there are difficulties with
  installation and the supply of heat pumps. Fixing these could encourage more
  efficient models and use, which could save about £140 a year. Some of the
  biggest savings could come from ensuring that consumers have access to cheaper
  off-peak electricity prices, which could save about £175 a year. Chris Galpin,
  the senior policy adviser at E3G who led the research, said: “So long as the
  UK is dependent on gas, heating bills will remain high. A heat pump can
  already be much cheaper to run than a gas boiler. But the government needs to
  act to make these heating bill reductions accessible to the average
  household.” The government is to announce its warm home action plan this
  autumn. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero
  said: “The British people are showing record demand for heat pumps and we are
  one of the fastest-growing markets in Europe. “We are exploring a range of
  options for rebalancing gas and electricity prices – securing better outcomes
  for consumers is at the heart of our approach, and we will set out further
  details in due course. We will also repair our retail energy market and ensure
  people have the best possible support to choose more affordable, smarter,
  clean energy that is right for them.”
