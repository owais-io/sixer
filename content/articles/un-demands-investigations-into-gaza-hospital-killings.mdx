  The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in
  Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital which killed 20
  people, including five journalists, yield results and ensure accountability.
  “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, spokesperson for the UN’s
  human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the
  number of journalists killed in Gaza raised many questions about the targeting
  of media workers. On Monday, Israel struck Nasser hospital, the last
  functioning public hospital in southern Gaza, twice. Witnesses said the second
  strike came just as rescue crews and journalists arrived to evacuate the
  wounded 15 minutes after the first bombing – killing first responders and
  media workers. The “double tap” strike killed journalists working for Reuters,
  the Associated Press and Al Jazeera, as well as independent journalists,
  drawing global condemnation. All three publications issued statements mourning
  the journalists and urged Israel to look into the killings. The office of the
  Israeli prime ministry said it “deeply regrets the tragic mishap” that
  happened at the hospital and that the Israeli military are conducting an
  investigation. The UN spokesperson urged Israel to ensure its investigation
  actually leads to results, referring to recent Israeli military investigations
  which were closed without resolution. “The Israeli authorities have, in the
  past, announced investigations in such killings … We haven’t seen results or
  accountability measures yet. We have yet to see the results of these
  investigations and we call for accountability and justice,” said Kheetan. A
  report published by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) this month showed that 88%
  of Israel’s investigations into war crime allegations in Gaza were shut down
  or left unresolved. Among the unresolved inquiries are investigations into the
  killing of at least 112 Palestinians waiting for flour in Gaza city in
  February 2024 and an airstrike that killed 45 Palestinians in a tent
  encampment in southern Gaza in May 2024. Researchers at AOAV said that the
  statistics suggested that Israel was trying to create a “pattern of impunity”
  in the overwhelming majority of cases where severe wrongdoing by Israeli
  soldiers was alleged. The Israeli military maintains that it has robust
  internal processes to when there is a suspicion of a violation of the law.
  Israel has frequently conducted strikes on hospitals throughout the 22-month
  war in Gaza, with the WHO reporting in April that 33 out of Gaza’s 36
  hospitals had been damaged. Israel has in the past claimed that Hamas has
  embedded within Gaza’s medical infrastructure, without presenting credible
  evidence for their claims. Israel has also regularly killed journalists in
  Gaza, now the deadliest place in the world to be a journalist. Israel has
  banned international media from entering Gaza, leaving Palestinian journalists
  to be the only source of news on the territory. According to the UN
  spokesperson, at least 247 Palestinian journalists have been killed in Gaza
  over the last 22 months. This is the deadliest conflict for journalists ever
  recorded, killing more media workers than in both world wars, the Vietnam war,
  the Yugoslavia wars and the US war in Afghanistan combined. Israel’s double
  tap bombing of the hospital on Monday provoked outrage and added to the
  pressure on Israel from rights groups and foreign ministries worldwide. French
  president Emmanuel Macron called the strikes “intolerable” in a statement on
  Monday. “This is intolerable: civilians and journalists must be protected in
  all circumstances. The media must be able to carry out their mission freely
  and independently to cover the reality of the conflict,” said Macron. On
  Tuesday, 209 former EU ambassadors and senior diplomatic staff published a
  public letter calling for urgent action over Israel’s war in Gaza and unlawful
  conduct in the occupied West Bank. They called on EU member states to take
  unilateral actions “in pursuit of protecting and enforcing international law”.
  Recommended actions included suspending arms export licenses to Israel,
  halting funding of projects with Israeli organisations complicit in illegal
  actions and prosecuting indicted Israeli and Palestinian war criminals if they
  enter their territories. Despite international and domestic pressure for a
  ceasefire, Israel is pushing ahead with its plans to take over and occupy Gaza
  city, a military campaign it expects could take up to five months. At least 34
  people were killed in Israeli strikes overnight and on Tuesday, health
  authorities said. Thousands of residents have already fled Gaza city as
  Israeli bombardment has intensified. Humanitarians have warned that going
  forward with the Gaza city campaign could have disastrous consequences for the
  wellbeing of the around one million residents there, already in the throes of
  famine. Hamas has delivered its latest ceasefire proposal to mediators, but
  Israel has yet to respond. Israeli media reported that the Israeli government
  is unlikely to accept the ceasefire proposal, seeking instead a comprehensive
  deal that would see hostages returned and Hamas exiled from the strip.
  Protesters gathered across Israel on Tuesday holding up pictures of hostages
  and demanding an end to the war. Demonstrators said that the continued
  fighting put the lives of the remaining hostages held in Gaza in danger. More
  than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza – more than half of which are
  civilians according to the Gaza health ministry – during Israel’s war in Gaza
  over the last 22 months. Israel launched the war after Hamas-led militants
  attacked Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.
