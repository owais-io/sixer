  Yvette Cooper will prevent judges from hearing appeals from rejected asylum
  seekers as part of government plans to clear the claims backlog more quickly.
  The home secretary will set up a new system of “professional adjudicators” to
  hear cases brought by people who have had their asylum claims turned down as
  the government looks for ways to process tens of thousands of cases. The
  proposals, which were first reported by the Sunday Times, have been worked on
  for months but are being accelerated in the wake of a legal ruling that will
  force the government to rehouse 138 asylum seekers from the Bell hotel in
  Epping within days. Other councils, including councils controlled by Labour,
  are bringing similar cases of their own, sparking concern in Whitehall about a
  sudden crisis in migrant accommodation. Cooper said: “We are determined to
  substantially reduce the number of people in the asylum system as part of our
  plan to end asylum hotels … But we cannot carry on with these completely
  unacceptable delays in appeals as a result of the system we have inherited
  which means that failed asylum seekers stay in the system for years on end at
  huge cost to the taxpayer.” She promised the government would overhaul the
  appeals system so that it was “swift, fair and independent, with high
  standards in place”. This weekend, there has been another spate of protests
  outside hotels in towns and cities across the country after weeks of
  demonstrations outside the Bell, which began after an asylum seeker living
  there was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. Rallies were
  held this weekend in places including Bristol, Liverpool, Newcastle, Wakefield
  and Aberdeen, and at least 15 people were arrested. The Guardian revealed on
  Friday that the far-right Homeland party had been trying to organise several
  demonstrations. Ministers face both public and legal pressure to find an
  alternative to hotel accommodation for asylum seekers around the country. The
  new appeals system is designed to finalise claims more quickly by cutting down
  the lengthy court process that often follows a person’s status being refused.
  Under the current system, people who have had their claims turned down can
  appeal to a tribunal judge. If refused once more, they can appeal again to a
  higher tribunal, which will assess only if the lower court made a legal
  mistake. The government has already set a 24-week limit on appeals being heard
  but officials say cases are still taking an average of 53 weeks. Under
  Cooper’s proposals, the government will set up a new commission with statutory
  powers to hear appeals. It will be given permission to prioritise the claims
  of people who are living in government-funded accommodation and foreign
  offenders with deportation orders. The Home Office released figures last week
  showing that a record 110,000 asylum applications were made in the year to
  June. But the government is processing claims more quickly, with 71,000 cases
  awaiting an initial decision, down from a peak of 134,000 cases at the end of
  June 2023. There are 32,059 asylum seekers living in hotels – more than when
  Labour came to power, but below a peak of 56,000 in September 2023.
