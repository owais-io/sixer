  A federal judge in Hawaii has ruled that commercial fishing is illegal in the
  Pacific Islands Heritage marine national monument, a federally protected area
  in the central Pacific Ocean. The decision from Judge Micah WJ Smith overturns
  an April letter released by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) –
  also known as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) Fisheries
  – that allowed fishing in parts of the monument that Barack Obama had
  protected during his presidency. The letter came about a week after Donald
  Trump’s presidential proclamation to reverse fishing regulations across the
  national monument, a world heritage site that includes archeological
  treasures, marine mammals, seabirds and coral reefs. Regulations banning
  commercial fishing in the area remain in effect, according to Friday’s ruling.
  The court said “no commercial fishing operators may reasonably rely on” the
  April letter, meaning fishing in waters 50 to 200 nautical miles around
  Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island, and Wake Island must halt immediately. “The
  Fisheries Service cannot ignore our perspectives as the native people who
  belong to the islands and to the ocean that surrounds us,” said Solomon Pili
  Kaho’ohalahala, founding member of the non-profit group Kāpaʻa, the
  Conservation Council for Hawaii and the Center for Biological Diversity. “The
  law guarantees a process where we can advocate for protecting the generations
  of our children’s children who are yet to be born.” The environmental
  conservation group Earthjustice, representing the non-profits in Hawaii, filed
  its lawsuit in May and argued the NMFS violated federal law by bypassing the
  formal process for changing fishing rules, which requires public notice and
  comment. “The court forcefully rejected the Trump administration’s outrageous
  claim that it can dismantle vital protections for the monument’s unique and
  vulnerable species and ecosystems without involving the public,” the
  Earthjustice attorney David Henkin said. Then president George W Bush created
  the marine monument in 2009. It consists of about 500,000 sq miles (1.3m sq
  km) in the remote central Pacific Ocean south-west of Hawaii. Obama expanded
  it in 2014. As part of his push to make the US the “world’s dominant seafood
  leader”, Trump called the regulations “so horrible and so stupid” – and
  claimed they force US fishers “to go and travel four to seven days to go and
  fish in an area that’s not as good”. The Pacific Remote Islands marine
  national monument is about 370,000 sq nautical miles (1,270,000 sq km), or
  nearly twice the size of the state of Texas. It is managed by the US Fish and
  Wildlife Service, the Noaa and the defense department. The monument is home to
  one of the largest collections of deep ocean coral reef, seabird and shorebird
  protected areas on the planet. It provides refuge for species threatened by
  the climate crisis and other stressors caused by humans. Kingman Reef,
  considered one of the most pristine coral reefs in US waters, is also part of
  the monument. Unesco reports it has the highest proportion of apex predators
  of any studied coral reef worldwide. Its waters are home to several shark
  species, including grey reef, oceanic whitetip, hammerhead and silky sharks,
  all of which play an important role in maintaining ecological balance. Along
  with the ecological value, the islands and ocean areas in and adjacent to the
  monument hold great value to Indigenous Pacific Islanders and researchers. The
  lawsuit says allowing commercial fishing in the monument expansion would harm
  the “cultural, spiritual, religious, subsistence, educational, recreational,
  and aesthetic interests” of a group of Native Hawaiian plaintiffs who are
  connected genealogically to the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific. “This is a
  huge win for the Pacific’s irreplaceable marine life and for the rule of law,”
  Maxx Phillips, staff attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said
  about Friday’s ruling. “These sacred and irreplaceable ecosystems are home to
  endangered species, deep-sea corals, and rich cultural heritage.” Associated
