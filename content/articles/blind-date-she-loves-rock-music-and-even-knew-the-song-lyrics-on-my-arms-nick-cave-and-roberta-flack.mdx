  Jane on Bryn What were you hoping for? To meet someone new, find some common
  ground and have a wonderful afternoon. First impressions? Bryn was warm and
  friendly, with a bright smile. What did you talk about? Tattoos. Families. The
  joys of real ale. Social care. Benidorm. Music – Bryn has fantastic taste in
  music. Most awkward moment? I felt a bit daunted about tackling my hanging
  kebab but Bryn sorted it. Good table manners? Perfect. Best thing about Bryn?
  He is extremely easygoing, a great listener and fun. Would you introduce Bryn
  to your friends? Yes. Describe Bryn in three words? Intelligent, confident,
  enthusiastic. What do you think Bryn made of you? Open, honest, easy to talk
  to. Did you go on somewhere? No. And... did you kiss? Just a little goodbye
  peck on the cheek. If you could change one thing about the date, what would it
  be? For the afternoon to have lasted longer. Marks out of 10? 10. I had a
  wonderful time. Would you meet again? Definitely. A real ale session is on the
  cards. Bryn on Jane What were you hoping for? A free meal and to meet someone
  new … and you never know where it will go. First impressions? A lovely,
  friendly smile and demeanour. What did you talk about? Sport. Music. Beer.
  Family stuff. There were no awkward silences. Most awkward moment? When I said
  I needed to get off, as I think Jane wanted me to stay longer. I would’ve done
  so happily, but the early start time threw me a bit. Good table manners? Yes.
  Best thing about Jane? She was just lovely to get on with. She’s a real ale
  drinker and loves rock music – she even knew the song lyrics that I have
  etched on my arms – Nick Cave and Roberta Flack. Would you introduce Jane to
  your friends? Yes, and I think she felt the same way. Describe Jane in three
  words? Chatty, friendly, easygoing. What do you think Jane made of you? I
  think Jane thought the same as me – we got on really well. Did you go on
  somewhere? We didn’t as we both had to get home on public transport. And ...
  did you kiss? We hugged as friends. If you could change one thing about the
  date, what would it be? The timing – 1pm was too early. Marks out of 10? As a
  friend and fellow real ale drinker she’s a solid 8/10, but I’m not sure there
  was a romantic spark. Would you meet again? We will meet for a drink at some
  point. Jane and Bryn ate at The Botanist in Chester. Fancy a blind date? Email
