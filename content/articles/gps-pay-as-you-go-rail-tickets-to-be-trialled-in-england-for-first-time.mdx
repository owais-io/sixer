  A new pay-as-you-go rail ticketing system that tracks passengers’ locations as
  they travel is to be trialled in England for the first time, as part of the
  government’s plan to reform the railway network’s complex fare system.
  Passengers on routes in the East Midlands will be the first in the country to
  test a pilot system, checking in for travel on their phones with their journey
  tracked using satellite location technology. The app will automatically charge
  them the best fare at the end of the day’s travel and provide a barcode when
  needed for ticket inspections or to pass through ticket barriers. The
  Department for Transport (DfT) said the technology, if it proves successful,
  would replace the need for paper tickets and mobile tickets using QR codes,
  which have to be bought before travel. Passengers will be able to travel
  without planning or booking journeys in advance. The technology, which has
  previously been tested in Switzerland, Denmark and Scotland, is being piloted
  in England first on East Midlands Railway services between Leicester, Derby
  and Nottingham, with trials to be extended to Northern Trains in Yorkshire
  from the end of the month. Up to 4,000 passengers are expected to take part in
  the pilots. The DfT said the scheme demonstrated its commitment to improving
  the passenger experience and trialling innovative technology to save time and
  money. The rail minister, Peter Hendy, said: “The railway ticketing system is
  far too complicated and long overdue an upgrade to bring it into the 21st
  century. Through these trials we’re doing just that, and making buying tickets
  more convenient, more accessible and more flexible. “By putting passenger
  experience at the heart of our decision-making, we’re modernising fares and
  ticketing and making it simpler and easier for people to choose rail.” Despite
  widespread consensus on the need to overhaul ticketing, the DfT and rail
  industry have yet to find a solution. The previous government had pledged to
  tackle England’s complex fare system, although attempts to make savings by
  automating ticketing and closing ticket offices were widely resisted by MPs as
  well as unions. Labour pledged a “best price guarantee” as part of fares
  reform under its plans for a nationalised Great British Railways, which it
  hopes will be up and running in 2027. Oli Cox, the head of commercial strategy
  at East Midlands Railway, said more than 500 people had registered for its
  part in the trial. He said: “We know that complex fares can be a real barrier
  to travel, but this trial removes that uncertainty, making it easy to simply
  tap in and out on your phone, safe in the knowledge you’re always getting the
  best-value fare on the day.” Meanwhile, many passengers in Scotland will enjoy
  cheaper journeys with the abolition of peak fares on Scotrail from Monday. The
  decision, announced in May following a trial in 2023-24, will cut the price of
  some tickets, such as a Glasgow-Edinburgh return in rush hours, by 50%.
