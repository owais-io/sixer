  Good morning. The slogan “black is beautiful” rang out from civil rights
  marches in the US and UK during the 1960s and echoed through liberation
  struggles across the global south. It became a rallying cry against racist
  beauty standards that had long cast Black skin, facial features and hair as
  undesirable. These movements urged pride in what had been denigrated for
  centuries, and their message was not limited to people of African or Caribbean
  heritage. Calls to embrace natural beauty resonated across Asia and much of
  the global south, directly challenging the colonial belief that lighter skin
  conferred greater worth. Yet decades later, that belief seems to endure.
  Across the world, women of colour continue to use skin-lightening creams, many
  laced with toxic ingredients, in the hope of meeting beauty ideals shaped by
  colourism. Now, we are learning that the results are becoming even more
  devastating. For the first time, medical journals have reported rising cases
  of cancers among women of colour using skin-lightening products. The industry,
  now worth US$10.7bn (£8bn), is expected to grow to US$18.1bn by 2033. Some
  reports even describe these products being used on babies and young children.
  To understand why skin‑lightening creams remain so prevalent, and what can be
  done to end their appeal, I spoke to Prof Ncoza Dlova, head of dermatology at
  the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. That’s after the headlines.
  Five big stories Ukraine | Donald Trump told European leaders on Wednesday he
  would be seeking a ceasefire in Ukraine at his summit with Vladimir Putin on
  Friday and gave reassurances that he would not make any territorial
  concessions without Kyiv’s full involvement. UK news | David Lammy has
  referred himself to the environment watchdog after going fishing with JD Vance
  without the required licence during the US vice-president’s trip to the UK.
  Immigration | At least 20 people have died after a boat capsized off the
  southern Italian island of Lampedusa, a United Nations agency and local media
  reported on Wednesday. UK politics | Keir Starmer is to formally revive
  Northern Powerhouse Rail this autumn with an announcement expected before the
  Labour conference. Palestine | The United Nations special rapporteur for the
  occupied territories has warned that moves to recognise a Palestinian state
  should not distract member states from stopping mass death and starvation in
  Gaza. In depth: ‘It’s psychosocial, political, historical – being lighter is
  seen as superior’ Recently, a patient walked into Ncoza Dlova’s clinical
  office in need of support. She had dark-coloured pigmentations, known as
  ochronosis, and stretch marks on her face and neck. The marks were as a result
  of a skin-lightening cream she had used for three years. When Dlova asked why
  she used the cream, she told her that she wanted to look like a friend she
  felt was more beautiful. Patients like this are now a daily occurrence for
  Dlova. “I said ‘I feel sorry about your situation, but unfortunately, I have
  to be realistic with you: there’s nothing I can do to reverse your skin and
  make it look like it was before’,” Dlova remembers. “There was a clear
  contrast between the face and the hand, with the hand being much darker and
  the face being much lighter. And then she broke down there and cried. I told
  her, I know this is painful, but now what I can offer you is using sunscreens
  to protect your skin from getting worse, or even getting skin cancers.” The
  Guardian’s global health correspondent, Kat Lay, reported last month on a
  string of cases of women dying from cancer after using these products for
  several decades. Dlova and colleagues are now working on a paper that cites
  more than 55 cancer cases, from countries including Mali and Senegal. “People
  don’t know the complications and side-effects. The patients I see who have
  side-effects regret it, and say they wish they’d known,” Dlova says. *** When
  did this become an issue? The use of these creams isn’t a new phenomenon.
  Reports of African women using skin-lightening creams and suffering harmful
  effects began emerging as early as the 1970s. At the time, these products
  often contained mercury as the bleaching agent, but their use was banned in
  South Africa in 1975 due to the risk of brain and skin damage. Manufacturers
  switched to using hydroquinone instead. But in 1975, a professor at Pretoria
  University, George Findlay, wrote about the harms of hydroquinone in the
  British Journal of Dermatology. He explained that while the chemical initially
  lightens the skin, it later makes it rough with dark lumps that can turn into
  abscesses and ulcers. These effects seem to be accelerated by exposure to the
  sun, making them particularly dangerous for individuals who use them in
  African countries. Dlova tells me this paper was groundbreaking and led to
  bans in other countries such as Rwanda and Ghana. But their use continues
  today due to weak regulation, while other companies are now using steroids in
  skin-lightening cream. *** What are the side-effects? The melanin found in
  darker skin typically is known to offer some protection against sun damage
  (though people of colour should still wear sunscreen). Skin-lightening
  products work by removing the melanin and therefore this layer of protection,
  and can make some people look lighter, but they come with a whole set of
  complications. The combination of hydroquinone and steroids can be
  particularly dangerous. “The immediate complication is the thinning of the
  skin, where you find that a person can’t use any products. Whatever they use
  on the skin, it stings and it burns because the upper layer has been thinned.
  And then there’s also fungal infections, which are common, because some of the
  steroids also are immunosuppressants,” Dlova says. “You can also get
  steroid-induced acne or rosacea. And some patients, if they’re using steroids,
  get excessive hair where they are using their products. There’s stretch marks,
  because of the damage in collagens, and irreversible pigmentation, such as
  ochronosis.” The other side-effect increasingly raising alarm? Skin cancer.
  The huge problem is that many women are simply unaware. A study Dlova recently
  carried out, of 700 women, found that 30% were using skin bleaching creams.
  And of those who were using the products, 90% of them didn’t know about the
  side-effects. *** Is this just affecting African women? The overwhelming
  majority of Dlova’s patients are women, though she does see some men. The
  reasons why are complex. “It’s psychosocial, political, historical, but
  colonisation is at the root of it. Being lighter is seen as superior,” she
  says. Research has found that lighter-skinned women often face shorter prison
  sentences, are seen as more intelligent in job interviews, and have greater
  career and dating prospects than their darker-skinned peers. “There’s so much
  pressure for darker-skinned women to change their skin colour,” Dlova adds.
  Just how much women are affected is still hard to say due to a lack of data.
  Across African countries, estimates in studies of its usage range from 25% to
  80% of women. But Dlova was keen to point out that the use of skin-lightening
  products affects countries across the globe. “This is not exclusively an
  African issue. It’s a global phenomenon. It’s as common in South Africa as it
  is in India,” Dlova says, “We know about the caste system in India and we know
  about colonisation there and in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand. In all
  those countries, skin bleaching is pervasive. Even in South America. “It’s
  important to highlight that, because sometimes people say, ‘Why are Africans
  changing their skin colour?’ No, it’s everyone who’s Black or darker-skinned
  trying to be white because of colonisation.” *** How can we stop it? When a
  number of African countries banned hydroquinone, there was a slight reduction
  in the marketing of these products. But that’s changed in the past decade
  because of social media, Dlova says. Now, a growing number of beauty
  influencers on Instagram, TikTok and Facebook promote these products with a
  simple message of personal transformation, while their toxic ingredients are
  rarely acknowledged. Dlova believes regulation alone is not enough to push
  back on this worrying trend. She has called for public health campaigns to
  explain the immediate and long-term risks of using these products, as well as
  addressing colourism and colonial legacies. Dlova is part of a global working
  group set up by the International League of Dermatological Societies to
  address skin lightening. She explains that the group includes dermatologists
  from across the world, including Japan, Korea, the Philippines, India, South
  America, Africa, Europe and the US. It also brings together anthropologists,
  historians, psychologists, community workers and patients. Her hope is that by
  involving people from many disciplines and regions, they can develop a
  multi-pronged approach to the issue. “We just need to look at examples of
  advocacy that have been successful in the past, such as smoking, HIV, and see
  how they did it. It has to be sustained and continuous, not just a one-off. It
  must go on so that people become used to it and they know.” Of this campaign,
  she said: “It’s something very close to my heart when I see these patients,
  some of whom are depressed or suicidal because they realise the damage from
  the products is permanent. It hurts me to see, it’s very painful.” What else
