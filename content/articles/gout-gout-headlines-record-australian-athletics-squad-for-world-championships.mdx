  All eyes will be on Gout Gout when he makes his senior national team debut
  next week after the 17-year-old was confirmed among a record 88 athletes in
  Australia’s squad for the world championships in Tokyo. After a
  record-breaking individual season that has attracted global attention, the
  teenager will make his senior national team debut as part of an exciting young
  sprint team featuring the likes of Rohan Browning, Joshua Azzopardi and Torrie
  Lewis. All five national relay teams have also qualified for the
  championships, which begin next Saturday and run for nine days, for the first
  time in history. The team announced on Wednesday is the biggest sent to a
  world championships by Australia, and contains a number of genuine medal
  hopes. Nicola Olyslagers, fresh from claiming the Diamond League high jump
  crown last week, will head to Tokyo as one of Australia’s best chances of
  winning a medal. The double Olympic silver medallist’s winning leap of 2.04cm
  in Zurich was a national record and the best jump in the world this year. Five
  other Paris Olympic medallists have been included in the team: reigning
  Olympic and world champion Nina Kennedy, in-form discus thrower Matthew Denny,
  race walker Rhydian Cowley, middle distance runner Jessica Hull and 2022 world
  high jump champion Eleanor Patterson. The squad is a blend of youth and
  experience, with the world No 4 pole vaulter Kurtis Marschall and fifth-ranked
  long jumper Liam Adcock featuring alongside nine medallists from the Under-20
  world championships, including Gout, 800m sensation Claudia Hollingsworth
  (20), long jumper Delta Amidzovski and long distance runner Cameron Myers
  (both 19). But Australia will be without Jemima Montag – a genuine medal
  chance in the race walk – and Lachie Kennedy, who became just the second
  Australian sprinter to record a legal sub-10 second 100m this year. Both
  pulled out with injuries in a major blow just weeks out from the
  championships. Andrew Faichney, the general manager of high performance at
  Australian Athletics, said the size and calibre of the team showed how far the
  sport has come, both on the track in a broader sense. “We’ve witnessed a real
  shift, not just in performance, but in national relevance,” Faichney said.
  “This team reflects that change. They’re world class athletes with the results
  to match, but just as importantly, they’re carrying the momentum of a sport
  that has so much belief behind it. “From podiums to grassroots, we’re seeing
  the influence of this generation of athletes. They’re showing what’s
  possible.”
