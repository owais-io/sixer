  Europe and the west’s double standards over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza
  threaten to undermine its global standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro
  Sánchez, has warned, describing the response to Israel’s assault on the
  Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of international
  relations in the 21st century. In an interview with the Guardian before talks
  with the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Wednesday, the
  socialist leader also said the US under Donald Trump was trying to end the
  post-second world war, rules-based global order it had originally created. He
  defended the benefits of migration and blamed traditional rightwing parties
  for breaking the consensus over the response to the climate emergency by
  copying the policies of their populist rivals. Sánchez – the first senior
  European leader to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza – said he was pleased
  that other European countries were following Spain’s lead in recognising a
  Palestinian state, but accepted Europe’s response had been poor. “It is a
  failure,” he said. “Absolutely. It is also the reality that, within the
  European Union, there are countries that are divided when it comes to how to
  influence Israel. But in my opinion, it’s not acceptable and we can’t last
  longer if we want to increase our credibility when it comes to other crises,
  such as the one we face in Ukraine. “The roots of these wars are completely
  different but, at the end of the day, the world is looking at the EU and also
  at western society and asking: ‘Why are you doing double standards when it
  comes to Ukraine and when it comes to Gaza?’” Speaking as he attempts to
  reassert himself on the international stage and move past a series of damaging
  corruption allegations that have battered his administration and fuelled calls
  for a snap general election, Sánchez said he was pushing Europe to do more,
  including punishing Israel financially. “What we’re now witnessing in Gaza is
  perhaps one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the 21st
  century, and in this regard what I have to say is that Spain has been very
  vocal within the EU and also within the international community,” he said.
  “Within the EU, what we have done so far is advocate to suspend the strategic
  partnership that the EU has with Israel.” Sanchez, who has clashed with Donald
  Trump over Spain’s refusal to meet the US president’s demands to spend 5% of
  GDP on defence, said Spain was a “reliable partner” in Nato. He said he was
  committed to preserving “the best relationship with the US”, regardless of who
  was in the White House – and despite Trump’s isolationist actions. “With all
  due respect, we have a pragmatic approach in our relationship with the US,” he
  said. “At the same time, I think we have a different vision on how to face the
  challenges that the world and our societies are facing. And I think there’s a
  big mistake with leaving the Paris agreement and reducing contributions to aid
  programmes and to the World Health Organization. But at the end of the day,
  our societies are facing global challenges that don’t understand borders, and
  we need to strengthen our cooperation and collaboration.” But he also said
  that the US’s withdrawal from global institutions could allow others to play a
  greater international role. “The most shocking reality that we’re facing is
  that the principal architect of the international order – which is the US
  after the second world war – is now weakening this international order, and
  that’s something that’s not going to be positive for US society or for the
  rest of the world, especially western countries,” he said. “That is why I
  think there’s an opportunity for the European Union and also for the UK.” He
  added that while still being loyal to the “transatlantic bond”, European
  countries could strengthen their power and influence – if they acted morally
  and consistently. “What does it mean? It means that we need to avoid these
  double standards. It means that we need to reinforce our commitment when it
  comes to the green pact. It means that we need to have a humanitarian and
  moral vision – and also a pragmatic one – when it comes to migration.” He
  added: “In politics, as in life, when you leave a gap, there’s always someone
  who’s going to fill it. And I believe that that’s what we’re also witnessing
  when it comes to some eastern Asian countries.” Wednesday’s meeting in London
  will be the first significant bilateral summit between the two countries’
  leaders for more than a decade. It was made possible by the UK and Spain
  striking a deal over Gibraltar’s future, ending the long-running dispute over
  the territory after Brexit and easing the movement of people and goods across
  the border. While Starmer and his Labour government have taken an increasingly
  hard line on immigration, Sánchez has been forthright about the benefits it
  can bring. “The dilemma that western societies are facing is whether we decide
  to be an opening-up and growing society, or a closing-off and shrinking
  society,” he said. “And so far, I believe that the vast majority of citizens
  in Spain understand quite well that migration is also an opportunity and not
  only a moral duty. It’s an opportunity to respond effectively to the
  challenges that we are facing when it comes to economic growth and when it
  comes to the labour market or helping to finance our welfare state in the
  present and the future.” Sánchez, who announced a 10-point plan earlier this
  week to help Spain mitigate the effects of the climate emergency, also warned
  that efforts to tackle the crisis were being undermined by rightwing parties
  adopting the far right’s narratives in the hope of electoral gain. “Of course,
  there’s a far right that denies the reality of the climate emergency,” he
  said. “The problem that we’re now facing is that there are traditional
  rightwing parties that perhaps don’t deny the scientific reality, but which
  act and behave as if climate change doesn’t exist. And this is the biggest
  problem. I think that traditional rightwing parties – not the far right –
  trying to transform the scientific evidence on climate change into ideological
  and political struggles is the biggest mistake that rightwing parties are
  committing. And this is something we’re facing in Spain.” He was speaking
  after the UK Conservative party said it will aim to “maximise extraction” of
  oil and gas in the North Sea if it wins power, copying Trump’s “drill, baby,
  drill” election slogan. Sánchez, whose party, administration and family have
  faced a slew of damaging corruption allegations over recent months that have
  threatened to topple his minority government, said he was committed to
  cracking down on graft, and to transparency. Asked whether he had confidence
  in Spain’s justice system given his claims that his wife is the victim of a
  rightwing and far-right judicial smear campaign, he said: “The large majority
  of judges in Spain fulfil their obligations and do their jobs … But there are
  some judges that are playing politics, and that’s a reality we’re facing not
  only in Spain but also in many other democracies – especially when it comes to
  progressive forces or progressive governments.” Sánchez said his minority
  government was delivering economically and socially and would continue to do
  so. “Of course these corruption scandals were very difficult for us to accept,
  but the political project is broader, and I think the most important message
  that I’d like to explain to my citizens is that the direction of the country
  that we started seven years ago is the correct one, and it’s not an abstract
  one,” he said. He said the opposition parties offered no real alternative,
  only “a regression”, adding: “What we’re witnessing in Spain is the political
  collapse of the traditional party, not only in substance, but also in style,
  because it’s copying the far right.”
