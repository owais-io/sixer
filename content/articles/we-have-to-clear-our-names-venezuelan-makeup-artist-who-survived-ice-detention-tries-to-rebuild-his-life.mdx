  Andry José Hernández Romero has already picked out the color of the suit he’ll
  wear to the next celebration of the Three Kings festival in his home town in
  the Venezuelan Andes. The carnivalesque celebration of Epiphany inspired the
  tattoos that landed him behind bars in El Salvador, accused of belonging to
  Venezuela’s most feared criminal gang, Tren de Aragua. The suit will be green,
  “like hope”, he said. Now free, and speaking over Zoom from his home,
  Hernández, 31, lifted his shirt to show two of the nine tattoos on his body:
  the words mom and dad, each inked beneath a crown. “This is the big
  controversy that has caused me too much harm,” he says. Hernández, a makeup
  artist, was one of 251 Venezuelan men flown from Texas to the notorious Cecot
  maximum security prison in El Salvador as part of Donald Trump’s crackdown on
  immigration. They endured months in a facility described as the “cemetery of
  the living dead” before finally being repatriated in late July, following a
  deal between the US and Venezuelan governments. Now, they are trying to
  rebuild their lives – and for Hernández, that means planning his outfit for
  the festival of Three Kings Day in his home town of Capacho – a celebration he
  has been fascinated by since he was a boy. “I’m already working on my suit. My
  mom is happier. Everyone wants to help me with the design and the fabrics,” he
  said. “What they still don’t know is that in Cecot I had so much time to
  think. The suit is already designed.” He was arrested last August after
  crossing the US southern border to attend a prearranged asylum appointment.
  Hernández, who is gay, told agents he was fleeing persecution stemming from
  his sexual orientation and political views. He was held for six months in San
  Diego, and on 15 March, he was put on a plane in Laredo, Texas, which he
  thought was headed for Venezuela. But when it landed, the prisoners saw a
  foreign flag flapping in the wind. At first, Hernández presumed it was a
  stopover, but the men were soon forced off the aircraft by screaming guards
  who quickly made it clear they were now prisoners of an authoritarian
  crackdown by the president, Nayib Bukele, in El Salvador. For four months, his
  family had no idea where he was. For them, he had been forcibly disappeared.
  There were no calls, no communication, no trace. Confirmation of his
  whereabouts only came on 20 March 2025, when CBS published a leaked list of
  238 Venezuelans sent to El Salvador. Later investigations confirmed that 90%
  of those deported had no criminal record in the US. Life inside Cecot followed
  a bleak rhythm. There was no sunlight, no answers, no information. But always,
  there was the sound of handcuffs. “I think they used it as emotional control –
  that sound of the cuffs and the doors,” he recalled. The yelling never
  stopped. “For everything. Because we spoke. Because we asked questions. For
  everything. “If that’s how they treated us, knowing we were just migrants, I
  don’t even want to imagine how they treat the regular inmates – the ones
  who’ve actually committed crimes,” he said. As a gay man, Hernández endured
  relentless harassment and taunting by the guards. “In El Salvador, believe me,
  human rights don’t exist. And LGBTQ rights? Even less. People in there who
  belong to the community have to be brave... we carry an extra burden. It’s
  hard for a regular prisoner to accept that he shares a cell with someone from
  the community. Someone different. Someone who loves the same sex. Who sees the
  world differently.” In interviews after his release, Hernández described an
  episode of sexual abuse. His lawyers have advised him not to speak further
  until they gather all the necessary evidence to file a formal complaint. “It’s
  a very hard and delicate thing to talk about,” he said. Nobody told the men
  that they were going to be released, but last month the prisoners noticed that
  something had changed at Cecot. Doctors came to check on them. They were given
  hygiene products. Guards started to drop hints. Then, 18 July, Bukele released
  a video making it official: a prisoner swap had taken place, exchanging 10 US
  citizens and several political detainees in Venezuela for the 251 Venezuelans
  held in the cages of Cecot. After 125 days locked up in El Salvador, the men
  boarded a flight home. Hernández arrived in Capacho early on 23 July. His
  mother was waiting with pisca andina, a traditional Andean soup. His younger
  brother had brought him his favorite comfort food – salchipapas, or fried
  sausages with chips. The return home was overwhelming. “I’ve been amazed by
  all the solidarity,” Hernández said. “All of Capacho, everything they’ve done.
  My parents never stopped fighting for my freedom. What they did for me – it
  was enormous. I’ll be grateful to them for the rest of my life.” Now,
  alongside his lawyers, he is focused on seeking justice – which, in his words,
  means clearing his name and those of his fellow deportees. “They have to clear
  our names. We were branded with legal ink. None of us belong to the Tren de
  Aragua. President Donald Trump and President Nayib Bukele must face the
  consequences of everything we went through in that prison. International
  authorities need to take action.” Hernández has started drawing again. Over
  Zoom, he scrolls through dozens of sketches of dresses – a lifelong hobby that
  helped him survive the darkest moments. But the trauma is still there: there
  are still sounds he struggles to process: keys jangling, doors closing, the
  fear that creeps in when he tries to sleep. “I thought it was just me, but
  several of my friends have said the same thing – that they can’t stand seeing
  a police officer or hearing the sound of keys or chains.” He had hoped to
  return to the world of art, makeup, design – and to pursue a dream he’s had
  since childhood: launching a foundation called Ángel de Dios, to support
  children with HIV and cancer. For now, out of concern for his safety, he
  chooses not to speak about Venezuela’s political context. “I think Andry
  Hernández is still going to be the same Andry as always,” he said. “I’m still
  the same person who cares deeply about the world of makeup – and about
  justice, especially when it comes to diversity and the LGBTQ community.”
