  The authoritarian strongmen Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have mused on how
  organ transplants might lead to immortality, during a brief exchange of small
  talk caught on a hot mic at a military parade. The Russian president was in
  Beijing on Wednesday with the Chinese leader, who hosted allies for a ceremony
  to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war. As Putin and
  Xi walked at the head of a delegation of foreign leaders, state media aired
  live footage that captured parts of what appeared to be a private
  conversation. While they made their way towards a raised platform in Tiananmen
  Square, Putin’s interpreter could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology
  is continuously developing.” After a brief inaudible passage, the interpreter
  added: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live,
  the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.” Xi, who was
  off camera, could be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this
  century humans may live to 150 years old.” Putin confirmed later to reporters
  he had discussed prospects for significantly increasing human life expectancy
  with Xi. Both leaders have shown little intention of relinquishing power in
  their lifetimes. In 2018, Xi abolished presidential term limits, paving the
  way for him to rule indefinitely. Putin has also changed Russian law to allow
  him to remain in high office. Sections of Russia’s elite, including Putin,
  have long been fascinated with longevity and the science of extending life. In
  2024, Putin instructed lawmakers to establish a research centre called New
  Health Preservation Technologies, dedicated to combating ageing. The project
  focuses on developing “technologies that prevent cellular aging,
  neurotechnologies, and other innovations aimed at ensuring longevity”.
  According to an earlier investigation by the independent Russian outlet
  Meduza, Mikhail Kovalchuk, a longtime family confidant of Vladimir Putin, is
  leading Russia’s research into immortality, a subject that he and other
  influential figures close to the Kremlin are reportedly “obsessed” with.
  Meduza reported that Kovalchuk has invested in organ-printing technology that
  uses lab-grown cells to produce replacement organs. Putin’s eldest daughter,
  the endocrinologist Maria Vorontsova, has received multimillion-dollar Russian
  government grants to study cell renewal and ways to extend human health and
  longevity and is involved in a genetic research programme linked to Kovalchuk.
  When sanctions were passed on her by the US in 2022, the State Department said
  she was leading Kremlin-funded genetics programmes worth billions. Putin and
  Xi walked alongside the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, during their
  conversation, who was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi. It
  was not clear if their chat was being translated for him. Later footage showed
  the three leaders walking up the steps towards the viewing platform for the
  parade. The moment was carried on the livestream provided by the state
  broadcaster CCTV to other media, including the international newswires AP and
  Reuters. China’s largest-ever military parade included 50,000 spectators and a
  big display of military hardware, from tanks and drones to nuclear-capable
  missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft. The performance was seen as a
  show of defiance to the west. Other attenders included the president of
  Belarus, Aleksander Lukashenko, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and
  Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing. In his formal address, Xi told the
  crowd that the Chinese people stood firmly “on the right side of history”. He
  said China was a great nation that was “never intimidated by any bullies” – in
  an apparent veiled reference to the US and its allies – and added that China
  was “unstoppable”.
