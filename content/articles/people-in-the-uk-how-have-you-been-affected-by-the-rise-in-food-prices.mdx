  Food inflation in the UK has hit 4.2% this month with there being a
  “significant increase” in the cost of staple foods such as butter and eggs.
  The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said prices had risen at their fastest
  pace for 18 months. Those on low incomes are most affected by food price
  inflation because they spend disproportionately more of their monthly budgets
  on the essentials of life compared with the wealthiest, who have more room to
  cut discretionary spending. How do you feel about food inflation? Have the
  price rises changed your shopping or eating habits? If you’re having trouble
