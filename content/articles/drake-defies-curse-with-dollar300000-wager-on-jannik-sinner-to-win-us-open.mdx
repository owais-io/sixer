  Drake is betting big on Jannik Sinner, wagering $300,000 on the world No 1 to
  win the US Open. The rapper known for placing big bets on sporting events –
  and often losing them – posted on social media the screenshot of a betting
  slip from Tuesday afternoon. The six-figure gamble pays $507,000 if Sinner
  captures his fifth major championship and second at the US Open. The so-called
  Drake Curse has been blamed for several losses over the past few years,
  including $210,000 on American Taylor Fritz to beat Sinner in the 2024 US Open
  final. According to a website tracking Drake’s announced bets and the curse,
  he is down $115,000 on tennis after cutting his losses by successfully picking
  Sinner to win the Australian Open final in January. Drake’s wagering history
  isn’t limited to tennis. During the 2024 Copa América, he lost another
  $300,000 when Canada fell to Argentina in the semi-finals, a gamble that would
  have paid nearly $2.9m. Argentina twisted the knife afterward by posting “Not
  like us” – the title of a Kendrick Lamar diss track aimed at the Canadian
  rapper – in a cheeky nod to their rival’s misfortune. The Canadian’s
  high-profile punts, and the cultural theater that surrounds them, have become
  a running subplot to major sporting events. Even as the “curse” narrative
  grows, Drake continues to put himself in the spotlight, for better or worse.
  Sinner, meanwhile, is doing his part to test it. The 24-year-old Italian
  reached the quarter-finals after routing Alexander Bublik in their
  fourth-round match. He next faces compatriot Lorenzo Musetti on Wednesday
  night and remains the betting favorite.
