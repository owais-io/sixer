  Silicon Valley is full of hubris and hugely wealthy and macho men who think
  they are victims, the former politician and Facebook executive Nick Clegg has
  said. The former leader of the Liberal Democrats makes the claim in a new book
  chronicling his three careers as an MEP in Brussels, an MP and deputy prime
  minister in Westminster and as a communications and public policy strategist
  in San Francisco. In an interview with the Guardian, Clegg heaped praise on
  his former boss, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Meta, but
  was scathing of the culture fostered in the tech capital of the world where he
  said wealth and power was interlaced with “self pity”. “In Silicon Valley, far
  from thinking they’re lucky, they think they’re hard done by, [that] they’re
  victims. I couldn’t, and still can’t, understand this deeply unattractive
  combination of machismo and self-pity. He said: “It is a cultural thing,
  through from Elon Musk’s chainsaw-wielding stuff to any Silicon Valley
  podcast. If you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression.”
  The former deputy prime minister added he was not talking about Zuckerberg
  personally, whom Clegg described as thoughtful and endlessly curious about
  subjects the Facebook founder did not excel in. Clegg has returned to London,
  having quit his job in the US in January, before a shift in political attitude
  across Silicon Valley where tech billionaires including Zuckerberg, Amazon’s
  Jeff Bezos and Apple’s Tim Cook began engineering proximity to Donald Trump.
  His new book, How to Save the Internet, goes behind the scenes at Meta and
  provides insight into how Silicon Valley’s insularity has blinded it to its
  missteps. “Everyone wears the same clothes, drives the same cars, listens to
  the same podcasts, follows the same fads,” Clegg said. “It’s a place born of
  immense sort of herd-like behaviour.” But of the three bubbles he has
  inhabited in his working life, Clegg said he found Westminster “the most
  insufferable, partly just because of the living on past glories and the
  pomposity of it”. Clegg had little to say on David Cameron, his coalition
  partner between 2010 and 2015, but said he would have disagreed with him on a
  referendum to leave the EU in 2016. The vote took place a year after the Lib
  Dems suffered a crushing defeat in a general election, prompting Clegg to quit
  as leader of the party and later take a role at the Facebook group, now known
  as Meta, in 2018. Clegg is convinced Britain will rejoin the EU within his
  lifetime, and said if he ever saw that debate resuming, he’d return to the
  political fray in a heartbeat, though not in public office. “I’d drop
  everything – whether to stuff envelopes or man the barricades,” he said. While
  Clegg said he had no desire to return to politics, his wife, Miriam González
  Durántez, is considering leading a new centrist party in her native Spain. But
  vacating the frontline of British politics doesn’t mean Clegg holds back on
  events in Westminster. Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves are “decent people”, he
  said, but maddeningly cautious. “I just wish they took bigger swings. It’s all
  these endless half measures – a little reform here, a little step towards
  Europe there, a little placation towards Trump. I think what they’ll learn,
  which I learned, is you only have one crack at it.” How to Save the Internet
