  Jonathan Mahler didn’t plan to publish his new book about New York City from
  1986 to 1990, tumultuous years culminating in a historic mayoral election,
  amid a similarly dramatic campaign for city hall. But he’s not unhappy to do
  so. The Gods of New York tells how the Democrat Ed Koch sought a fourth term
  as mayor but by election year, 1989, was widely seen as an “incumbent plagued
  by scandal, just like Eric Adams now”, Mahler said. “We had Rudy Giuliani, the
  tough guy from the outer boroughs – in Giuliani’s case Brooklyn, now in Andrew
  Cuomo’s case, Queens. And then we had the candidate of color who was saying:
  ‘I’m going to take the city back for the people who are getting left out.’ It
  was David Dinkins then and it’s Zohran Mamdani now.” Wary of generalization,
  as befits a veteran New York Times reporter, Mahler nonetheless said that as
  the city “went through a big transformation” from 1986-90, so “it’s going
  through another now.” The Gods of New York is a sequel of sorts to Ladies and
  Gentlemen, the Bronx is Burning, Mahler’s book about the city in crisis in the
  late 70s. Turning to the late 80s, Mahler presents a riot of stories from a
  period beset by racial tensions, the crack epidemic, soaring crime,
  sensational cases and an economic boom overwhelmingly boosting the rich.
  Keeping ordinary New Yorkers in mind, Mahler nonetheless presents
  extraordinary characters. “I will confess I went back and forth on the title,
  which was suggested by a friend,” Mahler said. “I thought: ‘That’s the perfect
  title.’ And then a handful of people were like: ‘You can’t possibly call it
  The Gods of New York. Are you saying Donald Trump is a god? And Rudy?” Forty
  years ago, no one foresaw the Trump of today: occupying the White House,
  dividing America, Giuliani a shameless sidekick. “I was like: ‘Well, not gods
  in that sense. This is much more like the Greek gods. They were kind of on
  their own tabloid Mount Olympus. Really, what I meant was that [Trump,
  Giuliani and others] were looming over the city like gods, not necessarily
  benevolent. Remember, the Greek gods were … wrathful, vengeful and petty. That
  was definitely what I was going for. Less literal, more figurative. So I stuck
  with it.” Readers could do worse than make The Gods of New York a double bill
  with Paper of Wreckage, an acclaimed oral history of Rupert Murdoch’s New York
  Post published last year, a chronicle of the gutter press and the stars. “All
  the characters were operating from the same playbook, in a way,” Mahler said
  of a cast that contains others still prominent, among them Spike Lee, then
  shooting his remarkable first films in Brooklyn, and the Rev Al Sharpton, a
  Black leader through the Howard Beach racist attack, the Tawana Brawley rape
  hoax and other scandals once boiling, now near-forgotten. “They were all
  trying to get the city’s attention and use that attention. We now use the term
  ‘attention economy’ all the time. This was really kind of the beginning of the
  attention economy and all these characters kind of intuitively understood
  that. The gay rights campaigner Larry Kramer “was organizing these incredibly
  in-your-face protests against the city and the country’s handling of Aids
  [that were] no different, in a way, from what Trump was doing and is still
  doing, which is trying to get people’s attention and keep it, trying to start
  a story and keep it going. “I’m not sure that I would have seen that parallel
  if I hadn’t seen Trump do it in 2016 when … I was working on reporting the
  [presidential] campaign. It was kind of crazy to watch him get elected,
  particularly as a New Yorker.” Working on The Gods of New York, Mahler saw
  Trump “using the same power to its ultimate effect: the insistence that he is
  never wrong, that you just keep moving forward. You act bulletproof, then you
  are bulletproof. I don’t know that I would have understood what he was doing
  in the 80s and what all these guys were doing if I hadn’t seen it play out on
  the biggest stage in recent years.” Kramer died in 2020, after giving a last
  interview to Mahler. In 2024, Trump surged back to power. Amid the fire and
  fury of the second term, reading about Trump in the 80s can feel a little
  jarring. As Mahler shows, even the Times was once drawn in. “There’s a great
  note in the Abe Rosenthal papers,” Mahler said, referring to the long-serving
  editor. “A staff member wrote him a note saying: ‘No wonder Donald Trump has
  such a huge ego: I don’t think anyone’s ever got on the cover of so many New
  York Times sections in such a short period of time.’ “I guess in some ways
  that’s a failure on the part of the Times to see who Donald Trump was, but I
  think also the context is important. In that moment, New York was recovering
  from some really dark days. The city was in a real death spiral for years. And
  then along comes this guy ready to invest in New York in audacious ways,
  really doubling down on the city. “And so you can sort of understand why, if
  you’re an institution like the New York Times that is very connected to New
  York, much more so then than today … they might feel like: ‘Well, this guy
  believes in New York, he’s betting on New York,’ and you can see how that
  might earn him some goodwill.” Mahler also documents Trump’s disastrous
  fixation with Atlantic City, which he utterly failed to turn into a gambling
  hub, to his considerable cost; his callous treatment of women; his notorious
  call for the Central Park Five, Black youths ultimately shown to have been
  falsely convicted of rape, to be sentenced to death. Crime stories run through
  Mahler’s book. The so-called Preppy Murder also centers on Central Park, where
  Jennifer Levin’s body was discovered. Prosecutor Linda Fairstein emerges as a
  thwarted hero, aghast at suspect Robert Chambers’ protection by the Catholic
  church and escape from the harshest sentence. And yet Fairstein went on to
  help subject the Central Park Five to a historic miscarriage of justice. “She
  was so demonized after the Central Park Five,” Mahler said. “I think it was
  interesting to see these two cases sort of as a pair, and the way in which
  Fairstein was so bitter about how the Chambers case played out … and then not
  even a couple years later, she’s confronted with the chance to sort of make
  amends. Not that this was a conscious decision, but you could see how maybe
  she was more zealous than she should have been [regarding the Central Park
  Five], because she felt … unsatisfied with the resolution of the Chambers
  case.” A man who held the stage longer than most, Koch, is perhaps Mahler’s
  central character. At the start, the mayor is riding high. By the end, he’s
  been brought low. Mahler said: “His third term was pretty clearly a disaster.
  But I think of him as a really sympathetic character … someone who was so
  flawed but also so committed to New York … he really cared about the city. I
  think that’s a good lens through which to see his feud with Trump [over
  Trump’s real-estate plays], because Trump was in it for Trump and Koch knew
  that was not in the best interest of New York.” Koch will also be known to
  history for being gay but not coming out, his mayoralty covering the worst
  years of the Aids epidemic, campaigners such as Kramer raging. Mahler tells
  that story, counting himself “very fortunate that the Times did a big piece a
  couple years ago about Koch’s sexuality, and kind of outed him. I feel like
  now … we all know this is how it was.” Was Koch a good mayor? “I think you
  would have to say yes and no,” Mahler said. “Though I’m not sure he had any
  other choice, as he had to do something to save the city, he set in motion
  this transformation, this shift toward private business that I guess we’re now
  seeing the sort of reaction against, with Zohran.” We’re back to the current
  campaign. Thirty-six years ago, in the election that ends Mahler’s book,
  Dinkins beat Koch in the Democratic primary then seized the big prize. Mahler
  rates the city’s first Black mayor as a good one “dealt a terrible hand”, the
  same fate that befell Benjamin Ward, the city’s first Black police
  commissioner. Dinkins served one term, losing to Giuliani in 1993. The city’s
  transformation continued. It always will, which helps make The Gods of New
  York such an enthralling read. The city Mahler shows is gone, but its stories
  remain. The Gods of New York is out now
