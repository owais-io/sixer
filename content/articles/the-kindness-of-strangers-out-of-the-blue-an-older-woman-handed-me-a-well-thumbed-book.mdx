  The kindness of strangers: out of the blue, an older woman handed me a
  well-thumbed book

  A few years ago I decided to improve myself physically and mentally. I did
  that by setting a couple of new year resolutions. One was to exercise
  regularly, the other was to read a book a week. The exercise part didn’t go so
  well because on 1 January, I went for my first walk and stepped on a branch
  that punctured my leg. But my plan to throw myself into reading was much more
  successful. Later that year I was on a long train trip from Sydney to
  Melbourne with a friend and told him about my reading goal. I was pretty
  stoked with how well I was going and was excited to talk about it. I didn’t
  think this was particularly interesting chat to anyone else on the train, so I
  certainly wasn’t worried about anyone eavesdropping. But at some point on this
  journey, an older couple stood up to get off the train. As they walked past,
  the woman handed me a well-thumbed copy of The Man Who Was Thursday by GK
  Chesterton. She smiled at me but didn’t say anything. Before I had time to
  process what had happened, she was gone. I didn’t even get a chance to say
  thank you. That was our only interaction on the train and her gift was
  completely out of the blue, with no pretext and no expectation. It was a
  simple, quiet gesture of humanity – kindness just for the sake of it. I didn’t
  quite hit my goal of reading a book a week that year, instead maxing out at
  about 30 books for the year, which was still a lot more than I’d ever read
  before. But what makes the memory even fonder is that The Man Who Was Thursday
  went on to become one of my favourite books – it now has pride of place on my
  bookshelf. That woman on the train had great taste. What is the nicest thing a
  stranger has ever done for you? If you’re having trouble using the form click
