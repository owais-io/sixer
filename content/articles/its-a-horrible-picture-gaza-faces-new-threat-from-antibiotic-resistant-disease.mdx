  Gaza is facing a new threat as diseases resistant to antibiotics spread across
  the devastated territory, research has revealed. Medical supplies are
  desperately scarce and tens of thousands of people have been injured in the
  22-month war, while many others have been weakened by malnutrition, so the
  high levels of drug-resistant bacteria will mean longer and more serious
  illnesses, a more rapid transmission of infectious diseases and more deaths,
  experts said. The findings published on Tuesday, in a peer-reviewed research
  comment in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, are the first since the conflict
  began in October 2023 to suggest a prevalence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria
  in Gaza. “This will mean longer and more serious illnesses and a high risk of
  transmission to others. It means an increased risk of death from really common
  infections. It means more amputations. It’s a horrible picture,” said Krystel
  Moussally, epidemiology adviser to Médecins Sans Frontières and a co-author of
  studies on drug-resistant bacteria in Gaza and other conflict zones in the
  Middle East, who was not involved in the research. The study is based on more
  than 1,300 samples from at al-Ahli hospital, where one of the few microbiology
  laboratories that is still functional in Gaza is based. Two-thirds of the
  samples, taken from patients over a 10-month period last year, showed the
  presence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Bilal Irfan, one of the authors of
  the study, described the results as “particularly alarming”. “We don’t even
  know the true scale because of the destruction of almost all the laboratories
  and the killing of a lot of the medical staff, so to even get a small insight
  into what is happening in Gaza is extremely important,” said Irfan, a
  bioethicist who conducts research at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s hospital
  and the University of Michigan. Gaza has suffered for decades from high levels
  of multi-drug-resistant bacteria as a consequence of repeated conflicts and an
  Israeli blockade since 2007, when Hamas seized control. But the current
  context was unprecedented, experts said. Not only has Gaza’s healthcare system
  been decimated but sanitation systems have been destroyed, the disposal of
  garbage and solid waste has almost stopped and hunger is widespread among the
  2.3 million population, making many more vulnerable to infection. On Tuesday,
  the World Health Organization said Israel should let it stock medical supplies
  to deal with a “catastrophic” health situation in Gaza. “We want to stock up,
  and we all hear about more humanitarian supplies are allowed in – well it’s
  not happening yet, or it’s happening at a way too low a pace,” said Rik
  Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in the Palestinian territories. Speaking from
  Jerusalem, Peeperkorn said Gaza had run out of more than half of medicines and
  the WHO was able to bring in fewer supplies than it wanted “due to the
  cumbersome procedures” and products “still denied” entry – a topic of constant
  negotiation with the Israeli authorities. Peeperkorn said only 50% of
  hospitals and 38% of primary health care centres were functioning, and even
  then only partly. Bed occupancy has reached 240% capacity in the Al-Shifa
  hospital and 300% at Al-Ahli hospital, both in northern Gaza. “The overall
  health situation remains catastrophic,” he said. “Hunger and malnutrition
  continue to ravage Gaza”. Israeli Ministry of Defence officials said more than
  45,000 tonnes of medical equipment had been transferred to Gaza since the
  beginning of the war and 13 fully equipped field hospitals established by
  international aid organisations. “Israel will continue to allow the entry of
  medical equipment and medicines into the Gaza Strip in accordance with
  international law and in coordination with the international community, while
  taking all possible measures to prevent the terrorist organisation Hamas from
  seizing the aid and exploiting it for terrorist and military purposes,” the
  officials said. At least 89 Palestinians, 31 seeking aid, have been killed and
  513 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to
  the territory’s health ministry. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has now killed a
  total of 61,599 Palestinians and injured 154,088 since 7 October 2023.
  Three-quarters of the samples studied by Irfan and the other authors of the
  new study were taken from casualties suffering traumatic wounds inflicted by
  Israeli airstrikes or similar attacks. In the Lancet, the authors said the
  threat from drug-resistant bacteria would escalate unless there was an end to
  the Israeli offensive and the “deliberate targeting of hospitals, laboratories
  and water desalination plants”. Moussally said that the problem had been made
  worse by massive contamination of water sources and “no proper immunisation
  programmes” during the war. The conflict was triggered by a surprise attack by
  Hamas into Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians,
  and abducted about 250 hostages, of whom 50 remain in Gaza. Only 20 are
  believed to still be alive.
