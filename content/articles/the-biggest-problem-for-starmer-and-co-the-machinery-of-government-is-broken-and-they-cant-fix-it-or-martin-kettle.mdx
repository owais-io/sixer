  In one of my favourite Seinfeld episodes, George Costanza is sitting in a New
  York diner and – this shows how long ago it was – reading his morning paper.
  Suddenly he folds the paper up, sets it down on the table and looks across to
  his companion with weary exasperation. Why, he asks, does the high-minded New
  York Times refuse to accept that China is a turn-off? Just like George, many
  readers will at some stage probably have experienced a similar feeling.
  Perhaps it was about China, but perhaps about something completely different.
  Call it the “not right now” syndrome. It is the syndrome that recognises that
  a subject might be important, but reading a lengthy report about it can be
  another thing altogether. Journalists know from bitter experience that prisons
  are often a turn-off as well. Prisons are remote, often unpleasant places.
  Most people have never been inside one, and are happy to keep it that way. It
  is important that prisons exist, of course. They do a difficult but necessary
  job. Hopefully they do it well. In most respects, though, prisons are out of
  public sight and, as a result, out of public mind. Until they are not. Today
  is one of those times when “not right now” no longer cuts it. The reason is
  the publication this week of a truly devastating report by Anne Owers, the
  former chief inspector of prisons for England and Wales, on the mishandling of
  prison capacity. The report lays bare the reasons why prisons have become so
  consistently overcrowded over so many years to the point of frequent
  near-collapse. But, as it does so, it also makes clear that the underlying
  cause is neither a surge in human wickedness nor a rise in overzealous
  sentencing by the courts. Instead, the cause is bad and broken government.
  This is why the report, indispensable though it is for understanding the
  prisons crisis, is also important in a wider sense. It reads like an account
  of not just a government department on the verge of failure, but a whole
  nation state. Owers shows how overcrowding has its roots in a conflicted
  approach that has been deeply entrenched among generations of politicians. On
  the one hand, 21st-century governments have all promised more police and
  tougher sentences. On the other, they have all promised to cut departmental
  spending, to hold taxes down and to outsource programmes. As there are almost
  no voters in prisons, the criminal justice system became a prime target for
  cuts. But the two policies were – and are – contradictory. The upshot was too
  many prisoners and not enough prisons or cells to house them in. This reached
  crisis point under Rishi Sunak’s government in October 2023, when Owers says
  the criminal justice system was within three days of meltdown. Early release
  schemes were hurriedly but grudgingly implemented. Many of the same pressures
  still exist under Labour today. Money is still tight and courts are still
  busy. The possibility of mass arrests this weekend in response to Palestine
  Action protests is simply the latest example of the system’s lack of headroom.
  Owers has two particular criticisms of systemic government failings. The first
  is that the response to our prisons crisis between 2022 and 2024 was far too
  bureaucratic and repetitive. Several committees, often involving the same
  people, found themselves endlessly having the same discussions without
  triggering action. The second is that “surviving the day” then became the
  overriding preoccupation for government. The approach in the Ministry of
  Justice (MoJ), which oversees prisons policy, was to manage the crisis, doing
  “as little as possible as late as possible”. But there is a third, very
  important criticism lurking in her account. Ministers were far too slow and
  unwilling to face the facts. Sometimes this was true even within the MoJ
  itself, but the main resistance was from the Home Office, the Treasury and 10
  Downing Street. The Home Office had an interest in talking tough and, as the
  former justice secretary Alex Chalk put it this week: “Some home secretaries’
  egos will be writing cheques that the MoJ is expected to cash.” The Treasury
  tried to hold the line against all increased expenditure. No 10 played for
  time because it feared the political optics of early release schemes. The sum
  of these actions was government without leadership. Some of this has changed
  under Labour. The justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, did well by
  commissioning three important independent reports on different aspects of the
  criminal justice process – Owers on prison capacity, David Gauke on
  sentencing, and Sir Brian Leveson on the criminal courts’ backlog – all of
  which (compare and contrast the Covid inquiry) have been briskly completed
  within a few months, their recommendations mainly accepted. The wider problems
  in Whitehall, however, remain. Mahmood still has to get all the changes in
  these reports past the Home Office, the Treasury and No 10, at a time when all
  three are preoccupied by Reform UK. Yet crisis processes and pressures are not
  in any way unique to the MoJ. On the contrary, they can apply across any part
  of government. Every Whitehall department has its hands tied by Treasury
  oversight. Think of the way the NHS, and thus the health department for
  England, moves into surviving-the-day mode as soon as winter looms. There are
  lessons in the Owers report for areas such as health and social care, welfare,
  policing, defence and education, as well as justice. All of this poses a
  collective challenge for the way that the British state is organised and does
  its business. It can be addressed, and perhaps answered, with skill and good
  fortune in one of two ways. One is by ever-more crisis management, in which,
  as Sam Freedman puts it in his book Failed State, politicians and officials
  “keep using the machinery we have, making promises they can’t keep, pulling
  levers that aren’t there, filling newspapers with announcements of actions
  that never happen”. That approach is broken. The other approach is for a more
  draconian reform of priorities. The Owers report depicts a system that does
  not work. Yesterday’s report by the National Institute of Economic and Social
  Research argued that, in her autumn budget, Rachel Reeves must either cut
  spending or raise taxes by more than £40bn if she is to balance the books
  without breaking Labour’s election promises. These are defining reminders of
  what is now at stake. It is foolish not to recognise that there are no easy
  choices here. The pitch has not been rolled with the public for change and the
  chances of success are uncertain. But it is no less foolish not to recognise –
  right now – that we cannot go on as we are. Martin Kettle is a Guardian
