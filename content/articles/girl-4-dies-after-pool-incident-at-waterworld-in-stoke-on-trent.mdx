  A four-year-old girl has died following an incident at a swimming pool at
  Waterworld in Staffordshire, police have said. Officers were called to the
  water park in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, at about 4.20pm on Monday to reports of
  a child in a critical condition. She was treated at the scene and then taken
  to hospital for further treatment but later died. The child’s next of kin have
  been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers,
  Staffordshire police said. In a post on Facebook, Waterworld said the fatal
  incident happened in the lagoon area of the aqua park on Festival Way. It
  added that the girl was “found unconscious and treated on poolside by our
  lifeguard and management teams on site. They immediately provided CPR and
  called the emergency services, who arrived around 4.20pm.” Waterworld will
  remain closed on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the leisure attraction said: “It
  is with great sadness that we learned of this little girl’s passing this
  evening. All our thoughts are with her family and loved ones during these
  extremely difficult times. “Waterworld is in shock and has decided to remain
  closed tomorrow out of respect for the family.” The spokesperson added that
  the park is working with the authorities. DCI Lucy Maskew from Staffordshire
  police said: “Our thoughts are with the family at this terribly sad time. We
  are now making inquiries and looking to establish the circumstances of the
  incident. “We would ask that members of the public avoid speculating in these
  early stages of the investigation and allow the family to grieve.” Anyone with
  information is asked to call 101 quoting incident number 460 of 4 August.
