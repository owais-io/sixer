  Lloyds Banking Group is to warn 3,000 staff that they are at risk of being
  sacked for underperformance, as part of a management overhaul led by the chief
  executive, Charlie Nunn. Bosses have been instructed to rank staff
  performance, with about 5% of its 63,000-strong workforce due to be put on
  performance plans that will put their jobs at risk unless they notably
  improve. About 1,500 of those put on notice could end up losing their jobs.
  Executives – who will monitor progress via HR software – are trying to address
  low turnover among its lowest performers, with staff having been less likely
  to leave their jobs amid continuing economic uncertainty. Fewer than 5% of
  Lloyds staff are understood to be leaving the group each year, which is below
  the 15% historical average. It comes as Nunn enters the final year of his
  five-year strategic plan, which is meant to diversify income, push more
  customers towards digital and mobile banking, and tighten up the sprawling
  business. Commenting on the possible job cuts, a Lloyds spokesperson said the
  move was part of efforts to “embed a high-performance culture in the
  organisation”. “As we build highly skilled teams to move faster forward and
  deliver great outcomes for our customers, we are striving to embed a
  high-performance culture in the organisation. To achieve this, and in line
  with wider industry practice, we continuously look for ways to help our
  colleagues perform at their best. “We know change can be uncomfortable, but we
  are excited about the opportunities ahead as we propel forward to achieve our
  growth ambitions and delivering exceptional customer experiences.” Ged
  Nichols, the general secretary of the Accord union that represents Lloyds
  workers, said the union had not heard of any managers having yet been asked to
  rank staff. “There has been an increased focus on performance in Lloyds
  Banking Group this year with more use of the structured support plans to help
  individuals who may be falling short of their performance objectives,” he
  said. “We work hard to support individual members through these processes to
  help them to keep their jobs and we’ll continue to do so.” Nichols added:
  “We’re asking Lloyds Banking Group to reassure its staff that it will continue
  to uphold the integrity of the established performance management processes,
  including the arrangements for individuals to be supported by their trade
  union.” Lloyds, which also owns the Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands, is
  well known for sweeping job cuts, which have again increased as part of Nunn’s
  strategic plan. In January 2024, Lloyds Bank revealed plans to cut 1,600 staff
  from its branch network, just months after confirming it would be slashing
  3,000 roles from the wider business, including middle management. The bank
  said at the time that it was simultaneously creating thousands of new
  positions that would result in a net increase in its workforce, as part of its
  broader shift to digital banking and asset management. Earlier this year,
  Lloyds also started letting customers use any of its brands’ branches,
  regardless of which lender they held accounts with, raising concerns of site
  closures and job cuts. It started hiring hundreds of IT engineers in India
  this year, prompting speculation it could start cutting more roles in the UK.
  Nunn is also having to steel the business for a multibillion-pound
  compensation bill over the car finance commission scandal, which involved
  drivers being overcharged via commission arrangements between lenders and car
  dealers as far back as 2007. Lloyds has already put aside £1.2bn for potential
  compensation. Shares in Lloyds were up nearly 1% on Thursday morning after
  news of the management overhaul, which was first reported by the Financial
  Times.
