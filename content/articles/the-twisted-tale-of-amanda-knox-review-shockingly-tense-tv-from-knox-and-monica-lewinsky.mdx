  The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox review – shockingly tense TV from Knox and
  Monica Lewinsky

  Two things need to be borne in mind about The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox, a
  new true crime drama. The first is that Knox and Monica Lewinsky – both
  members of “The Sisterhood of Ill Repute”, as Knox has described them in the
  past – are executive producers of the show. The second is that the family of
  Meredith Kercher, the 21-year-old British exchange student with whose murder
  Knox and others were charged in 2007, were not involved in the series. Her
  sister Stephanie said last year to the Guardian: “Our family has been through
  so much and it is difficult to understand how this serves any purpose.” To the
  first point: it is undoubtedly true that the subject of The Twisted Tale is
  Knox and her survival of an extraordinary and extraordinarily awful
  experience, and while not hagiographic, it is not a warts-and-all profile
  either. Then again, how much warts-and-all can there be for an ordinary
  20-year-old excited to be studying abroad – in Perugia, Italy – for the first
  time? If you set aside the salacious narrative built up around her by a rabid
  press and fuelled by the preconceived prosecutorial notions around the crime,
  that is what she was. To the second: the grief of the Kercher family, and
  their enduring loss, is a terrible thing. But the purpose of the series is
  clear – to show how this particular miscarriage of justice took place and, by
  implication, how different forces, prejudices and appetites can combine to
  bring them about in general. It is designed to give the lie to the appealing
  notion that justice is always blind and its administrators are always beacons
  of rectitude, shining light into the darkness of depraved people’s souls. Over
  the course of eight dense and often extremely tense episodes, writer KJ
  Steinberg (best known for This Is Us) maps out Knox’s long journey from first
  arrest for her flatmate’s murder to eventual exoneration, via wrongful
  conviction, four years in prison and multiple trials. The outlines of the case
  are probably remembered by many of us of an age to have followed the headlines
  and articles that proliferated at the time, and the series does a good job of
  illustrating each pivotal point as it arises (the initial misstep in
  establishing the time of death, for example. Similarly, the misinterpretation
  of the English phrase “See you later” as meaning definite plans to meet had
  been established between Knox and her initially co-accused, Patrick Lumumba,
  reminiscent of the very British “I popped him on the bed” expression
  misconstrued by a US audience in the Louise Woodward trial), while a
  propulsive energy keeps the whole narrative going. Strenuous efforts are made
  to humanise public prosecutor Giuliano Mignini (Francesco Acquaroli), who led
  the murder investigation as a man led astray by his passionate sense of duty
  and frustration over his experience of pursuing the infamous Monster of
  Florence serial killer. His subordinates are given shorter shrift, and remain
  ciphers who are portrayed as having taken against Knox on a whim then found
  more and more things to be disgusted by, such as her public displays of
  affection with her boyfriend and later co-accused Raffaele Sollecito, and the
  vibrator in her washbag. Perhaps the most shocking part of the story is the
  fact that Knox’s ordeal continued even after the trial and conviction of Rudy
  Guede, the man whose fingerprints and DNA (unlike that of Knox, Lumumba and
  Sollecito) were all over the crime scene. Or perhaps the most shocking part is
  that his name hardly resonates in the public consciousness, while “Foxy Knoxy”
  still has such potency. The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox has its flaws. The
  mannered, Wes Anderson-lite openings to each episode sit uneasily with the
  harrowing hours to which they give way and the script – particularly in those
  openings – can be dreadful. “We were just getting to know our young selves in
  this charmed and ancient city,” says Knox in a voiceover early on. And later:
  “Does truth actually exist if no one believes it?” At one point, investigator
  Monica (Roberta Mattei) describes Knox providing “unsolicited information in
  crude American spasms”. Fortunately, the main parts are held together by an
  unreservedly brilliant performance by Grace Van Patten as Knox, in English and
  Italian (halting at first, fluent by the end of Knox’s incarceration), the
  ebullient, naive, overconfident, shattered young woman caught in so many
  currents and cross-currents it seems a miracle that she ever made it back to
  shore. • The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox is on Disney+ now
