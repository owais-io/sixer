  Booze up: is gen Z’s ‘sensible’ relationship with alcohol moving towards
  hedonism?

  Gen Z have long been hailed as “generation sensible” – dozens of articles have
  charted how they drink less alcohol, exercise more, eat a more healthy diet
  and have ditched night clubs for book clubs. But could that be about to
  change? Recent data has shown the proportion of gen Z – those born roughly
  between 1997 and 2012 – who are of legal drinking age and have consumed
  alcohol in the past six months has increased by 7% between 2024 and 2025.
  Alcopops are apparently all the rage among gen Z customers, with booming sales
  of Smirnoff Ice, Bacardi Breezers and BuzzBallz, while last year’s “brat
  summer” was said to herald the end of the clean-living era. The reality,
  experts say, is more complicated. “We’re seeing a generational recalibration,
  not a simple return to hedonism,” said Ivo Vlaev, a professor of behavioural
  science at Warwick University. “This isn’t a simple return to the past – it’s
  a complex blend of coping, compensation, identity expression and socioeconomic
  constraint. The behaviours may look familiar, but the psychology behind them
  has evolved.” He said the fact that gen Z came of age during a pandemic,
  climate crisis and increased concerns over the cost of living was a recipe for
  “psychological whiplash”. Key factors at play included a rebound from the
  restrictions of the Covid era with young people now “reasserting agency
  through social behaviours”. Vlaev said research showed that “when autonomy is
  suppressed, people later overcompensate with behaviours that signal freedom or
  control”. There was also an element of “self-soothing” as a result of rising
  levels of anxiety, depression and loneliness, as well as the glamorisation of
  certain drinks and behaviours on TikTok. Financial concerns may have also
  pushed the younger generation towards “present-biased decision-making”. “When
  the future feels unstable, people are less likely to invest in long-term
  health and more likely to seek short-term mood boosts, like alcohol or late
  nights out,” he said. Vlaev also said an element of “wellness culture” fatigue
  had probably set in. “Some gen-Zers are pushing back against the pressure to
  optimise every aspect of life,” he said. Richard Halstead, chief operation
  officer of consumer research at drinks market analysis company IWSR, said:
  “From a consumer research and data point of view, it does seem there is some
  pushback on this idea that we’re all perfect, having perfect pictures taken of
  us on Instagram and we’re all super in control of our lives. “Every cultural
  move has a countercultural move associated with it.” He said gen Z’s attitude
  towards drinking and socialising was more nuanced than is often portrayed in
  the media – gen Z were not “puritans” who abstain from alcohol, but nor did
  they like booze as much as previous generations. “The idea that gen Z do not
  drink at all or that they have turned their backs on alcohol is not supported
  by data,” he said. “The idea that they have a different relationship with
  alcohol compared to previous generations is supported by data.” He said that,
  for instance, gen Z were more likely to drink a wider variety of alcohol, and
  drink out in bars and restaurants. “Their pattern of behaviour is actually
  going out for a reason, as opposed to just meeting for a pint in the pub
  because the pub’s there and you’ve got nothing better to do,” he said. Dr
  Laura Tinner, a research fellow at the Centre for Public Health at the
  University of Bristol, said people should not underestimate the power of the
  alcohol companies themselves, keen to capture a younger audience they feared
  they were losing. “It’s not necessarily that there has been a swing in the
  pendulum or a return to previous drinking behaviours, it’s more that alcohol
  companies are continually trying to target young people with their products,”
  she said. “They are using the current revival and zeitgeist around 00s and 90s
  culture to design their products to target young people.” There was also a
  suggestion that gen Z were simply older – they are now roughly between the
  ages of 13 and 28 – so those at the older end of the group were more likely to
  have access to well paid jobs and disposable income. “I think we’re seeing
  some tailwinds develop,” said Halstead. “They’re getting older so some are
  probably in better paying, stable jobs and they’ve got more opportunity
  perhaps to do things that people with a bit more money like to do, which is go
  out and buy a drink and not worry too much about how much it costs you.” What
  many researchers were interested in was whether the characteristics that make
  gen Z different from their predecessors will stay with them as they age, with
  evidence suggesting generations become more and more similar as they get
  older. “We’ve always had a question about whether or not the decline [in
  drinking alcohol] will persist into adulthood,” said Dr Laura Fenton, a
  research associate at the University of Sheffield who specialises in youth
  drinking cultures. “What makes gen Z slightly distinct as a generation is
  their attitude towards risk. They’ve engaged in fewer [risky pursuits]
  proportionally compared to people their age 20 years ago – and that extends to
  sex, it extends to driving, it extends to smoking and drug use,” she said. “I
  think the question really is, is their approach to risk going to stay intact?”
