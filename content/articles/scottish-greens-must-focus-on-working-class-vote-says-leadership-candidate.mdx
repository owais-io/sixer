  The Scottish Greens have to broaden their appeal beyond middle-class urbanites
  by talking to voters in industrial towns facing wholesale job losses, a Green
  leadership candidate says. Gillian Mackay is one of four Scottish Greens
  bidding to win two co-leader posts after Patrick Harvie, the UK’s
  longest-serving party leader, quit as co-convener earlier this year. The
  pro-independence Scottish Greens are Holyrood’s fourth largest party, with
  seven MSPs, and could play a key role in the devolved parliament after next
  year’s elections. The Greens prop up the Scottish National party government in
  Edinburgh, which does not have a majority at Holyrood and is expected to form
  a minority administration again next year. Recent polls place the Greens as
  high as 15%, suggesting they could win several more seats. Mackay said her
  area around Falkirk had been devastated by industrial decline, including the
  closure of Grangemouth oil refinery earlier this year, yet the Scottish Greens
  historically had failed to connect with local voters. The Scottish and UK
  governments knew Grangemouth would close, affecting several thousand jobs in
  the region, but had failed to put in place an industrial strategy to guarantee
  green jobs, she said. Two factories owned by Alexander Dennis making electric
  buses were also expected to close within weeks and their jobs to shift to
  Nottinghamshire. Farmers and workers dependent on the oil industry around
  Aberdeen also felt excluded. That meant the just transition from fossil fuel
  industries to sustainable jobs had failed, Mackay said. “The Green narrative
  of green jobs and green industry actually needs to have teeth,” she said. The
  party was very good at the “high-level” policy but poor at making it
  meaningful to people directly affected. “What matters to our voters is what
  they see, feel and hear in their communities and I don’t think we’re quite
  cutting through at that level.” Voting for the two co-convener posts opened on
  Wednesday, with about 7,500 party members eligible to vote before a result is
  declared on Friday 29 August. Alongside Mackay, the candidates are Lorna
  Slater, Harvie’s current co-convener, who had a torrid time as a Scottish
  government minister in the Greens’ power-sharing deal with the SNP, Ross
  Greer, a backbencher, and Dominic Ashmole, a party activist in the Scottish
  Borders who is vying to become a councillor for the first time. Unlike Green
  party elections in England and Wales, Scottish rules make it harder for two
  candidates to run on joint tickets, because their names cannot appear on the
  ballot paper as joint candidates. And, for the first time, the Scottish Greens
  have dropped a rule that requires the party to elect at least one woman as
  co-leader, after legal advice partly influenced by the UK supreme court ruling
  on the Equality Act’s definition of a woman. Greer, who has called for free
  travel on all of Scotland’s buses, is widely seen as a favourite to win one of
  the two posts. With Ashmole considered a rank outsider, the contest for the
  second post is between Slater and Mackay. Given her almost three years as a
  junior minister, Slater is presenting herself as the more experienced
  continuity candidate. She has told party members she believes co-conveners are
  their delegates and are not in overall control. Her critics point to the
  intense controversy surrounding her failed attempt to introduce a wide-ranging
  deposit return scheme for drinks containers in Scotland before the rest of the
  UK. Greer, an architect of the Bute House power-sharing agreement with the
  SNP, believes the party needs stronger political leadership and has to be much
  clearer on its core policies, on poverty, climate and nature. “We need to nail
  down which voters we’re trying to speak to and what we’re trying to achieve,”
  he said.
