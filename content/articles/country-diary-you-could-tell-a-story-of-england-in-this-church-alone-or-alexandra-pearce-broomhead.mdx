  A sign in the layby boldly declares: “The world’s oldest wooden church, open
  today.” Just beyond, beneath an arching yew, is St Andrew’s Church in
  Greensted, its architecture a historical mosaic, a seemingly mismatched
  patchwork that forms a striking whole. People have been worshipping here for
  at least 1,300 years. In the 1960s, archaeologists uncovered the impression of
  two wooden buildings, potentially built in the late sixth or early seventh
  century, when Christianity was taking root in the region. But it is the
  palisade nave that has earned the church its remarkable claim. A copse of 51
  split oaks forms the central body of the church, constructed around 1060
  during the reign of Edward the Confessor, and at one time adorned with nothing
  but a thatched roof. An eag-thyrel, an eye hole, which allowed the priest to
  see outside activity – vital during the ninth-century Danish invasions – and a
  niche, potentially to hold holy water, would have cast the only thin beams of
  natural light across the soil floor. All other illumination would have been
  provided by lamps, torch marks scarring the timbers. Over time, transformative
  restorations took place, giving it the patchwork look: flint remains indicate
  a chancel built by the Normans; the current brick one was built by the Tudors,
  along with a tiled roof. The Stuarts added the white tower in Essex clapboard
  style, while the Victorians rejuvenated rotting timbers and preserved the
  building for future generations. And the stories continue in the details: the
  beam etched with the face of Saint Edmund, king of East Anglia, whose body
  briefly rested here on route to Bury St Edmunds; the 12th-century crusader’s
  grave whose stone tomb hints at a heroic status; the 1839 entry in the
  marriage register of one of the Tolpuddle Martyrs, who held tenancies here
  before emigrating to Canada. The church is still in use today; services are
  held every Sunday, as well as marriages and baptisms. While it and its grounds
  are beautiful, it is the oaks that capture the attention. Each is individual
  in size and character, time-weathered and aged to black. They have witnessed
  Viking raids, the decline of paganism, medieval pilgrimages, war, the
  Reformation and the plague. Centuries held in knot and burr, they remain
  rooted in Essex’s past and present. • Under the Changing Skies: The Best of
