  Eliud Kipchoge knows he has nothing left to prove. The Kenyan running great
  dominated marathons like no athlete before him after crossing the line first
  in his debut race in Hamburg in 2013. Kipchoge has since won 14 more marathons
  including at back-to-back Olympic Games, twice set a world record in the
  event, and is still the only person to run 42.195km in under two hours. As he
  passes 40 years of age and his running powers begin to wane, Kipchoge is
  embarking on an even greater mission – to inspire more people to not only run,
  but to get themselves to the starting line for the most mentally and
  physically demanding of events. Kipchoge is in Sydney to promote the sport
  that he is “in love with” as much as to run the race, which became the seventh
  World Marathon Major on Sunday. The Kenyan finished in ninth place. “I trust
  that I have nothing to prove,” Kipchoge says. “I’m privileged to still be
  running at this age. I’m actually more in love with marathons now just to
  participate and inspire people. Above all, I’m running for humanity, running
  for hope and telling people to come out and run. I came here to tell
  Australians to please help me, I will help you to make this country a running
  nation. And I think we achieved that in Sydney. “I’m learning that those who
  are running behind me are the happiest people because they feel it more. They
  run in a slow way. They learn in a slow way, but they cross the finish line in
  the happiest way.” Kipchoge raised the bar in marathons across a decade of
  dominance but last won a race almost two years ago, in Berlin for a record
  fifth time. When he gradually fell off the pace through the second half of the
  race in Sydney, his popularity and appeal only became more apparent as the
  bumper crowds saved their biggest cheers for Kipchoge while he followed the
  leading pack. Kipchoge has little interest in discussing his remaining goals
  around finishing places or times, even while reflecting on his race in Sydney,
  instead switching focus to the people he wants to encourage to find their own
  motivations and push their limits. “In my mind [while running] are the people
  who could present themselves at the starting line, to get them to sign in and
  run,” Kipchoge says. “It’s not about running fast. It’s about completing a
  marathon. It’s about getting that experience. “A marathon is the only place on
  Earth where you can experience that running pain. Train hard and know the
  blood and sweat that it takes. Cross the finish line with tears. Because this
  is about the real human being going through those pains. The moment you start
  and finish, you’ll never be the same. You can’t be rewired again. You’ll be a
  different person.” Ethiopian Hailemaryam Kiros set a new benchmark for a
  marathon on Australian soil when crossing the line in Sydney in 2:06:06, with
  Kipchoge trailing two minutes and 25 seconds behind. The women’s race was also
  completed in record time for a marathon in Australia as the Netherlands’
  reigning Olympic champion Sifan Hassan finished in 2:18:22. While the elite
  men are closing in on the two-hour barrier in official race conditions, Hassan
  is the next star of long-distance running with a captivating personality and
  four wins in her six marathons to date. Hassan is on a similar trajectory to
  Kipchoge’s early years racing marathons and he is as excited as any fan while
  talking about what the Dutch runner – who earlier won Olympic gold in the
  5,000m and 10,000m in Tokyo – now means for the sport. “Sifan Hassan is the
  leader of a new generation of athletes who can inspire many people to come in
  and run fast,” Kipchoge says. “She teaches people to respect the sport, bring
  competitiveness in the sport, bring beauty, make sure they get all the people
  to come and watch the sport. She’s the one.” Mere mortals might be in recovery
  mode the day after running a marathon. For Kipchoge it is another opportunity
  to promote the event and the Abbott biowearables and glucose monitors that are
  among the technologies he uses and says have revolutionised running “100%”
  since he first raced a marathon, 12 years ago. It’s hard to believe that
  Kipchoge’s last marathon could be on the horizon while he continues to speak
  so enthusiastically about the event. His commitment to the cause is obvious as
  he recalls statistics around the growth of the Sydney marathon; it had more
  than 35,000 runners this year and Kipchoge hopes it will expand beyond 50,000
  in the coming years. The New York marathon is the only race in the world major
  series that Kipchoge is yet to run; but he is adamant that he will
  “absolutely” return to Sydney to again take on the challenging and hilly
  terrain that spectators might not appreciate while watching the race cross the
  Harbour Bridge and finish at the Opera House. “It’s a special course,”
  Kipchoge says. “Every world marathon course has its own beauty, its own
  terrain. But this is a beautiful and unique course. The beauty was about the
  crowd, the way people cheered on the way, at the beginning, at the finishing
  line, it was wonderful. “Above all, those who are running have an
  understanding, cheering me on, taking photos, and while they are still
  running. It was touching, it was beautiful. I will remember Sydney.”
