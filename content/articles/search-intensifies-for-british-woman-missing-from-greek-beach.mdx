  A mammoth search-and-rescue operation for a British woman last seen lounging
  on a sunbed in Greece has intensified days after her “mysterious”
  disappearance. The Hellenic coastguard, backed by a flotilla of pleasure craft
  and fishing boats, has fanned across the waters off Ofrynio beach near the
  northern town of Kavala, where Michele Bourda, 59, went missing on 1 August.
  “The search is very much on, with a patrol vessel and other recreational boats
  out scouring the seas all along the Strymonian Gulf,” said a coastguard
  official. “Three days may have elapsed, but there are no plans to call off the
  operation yet.” While vessels combed the sea on Monday, police also continued
  an extensive search on land, authorities said. Bourda, described as a
  “temporary resident” of Serres in northern Greece, was reported missing by her
  Greek husband on Friday after he awoke from a nap on a sunbed to find his wife
  had vanished from the adjacent lounger, though her belongings were still
  there. When authorities failed to find Bourda, LifeLine Hellas, a Greek
  missing persons charity, issued a silver alert – often activated when missing
  people are suffering from Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia – prompting
  a large-scale and coordinated search by rescue services. In its appeal for
  help, the charity described Bourda as about 5ft 6in tall and of slim build.
  “On the day she went missing, she was wearing a swimsuit with decorative
  stones, yellow water shoes, and red plastic sunglasses. Her life is in
  danger,” it said. The British embassy in Athens issued a similar statement. As
  Monday drew to a close, Greek officials said that no decision had yet been
  made about whether or not to continue the search-and-rescue operation on
  Tuesday. “Hope dies last,” said one. “Any scenario would be guessing at this
  point, and it is too early to make any decision.” Even if the coastguard
  operation was brought to a halt, the search would continue on land, and
  regular patrol boats would still comb the seas as part of their daily
  activities. Bourda is not the first Briton to go missing in Greece this
  summer. Last month, another silver alert was activated after the family of
  60-year-old Jay Arnold notified police that he had vanished while holidaying
  on the southern Aegean isle of Karpathos. Arnold, who was staying in the
  village of Olympos in the north of the island, was last seen by a local woman
  from whom he had been renting accommodation. Police were alerted when he
  failed to check out of his room on the day he was due to leave. Though his
  rented car was found parked and locked, authorities have since described the
  search for him as “going cold”. “We’ve had dogs brought in, drones, specially
  trained police and volunteers out there looking and we’ve found nothing,”
  local police officer Panayiotis Fotopoulos said. “It’s very odd, a total
  mystery, that absolutely nothing should be found after so many weeks. We’re
  not ruling out that perhaps he fell into the sea.” Last June, the celebrity
  doctor and TV presenter Michael Mosley was found dead five days after he went
  missing on the remote Greek island of Symi. An inquest determined he had
  likely died as a result of accidental heatstroke after getting lost as he
  attempted to return from the beach to his lodgings. With its crystal clear
  blue waters and golden sands, Ofrynio beach is among the most picturesque
  places in northern Greece, which, like the rest of the country, has been hit
  by record temperatures in recent weeks.
