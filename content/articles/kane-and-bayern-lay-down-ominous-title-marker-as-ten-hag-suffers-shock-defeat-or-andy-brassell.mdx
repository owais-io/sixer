  Remember when Harry Kane never scoring in August was a curio that felt like it
  needed an exorcism? Nobody in Germany remembers, and an era when Bayern
  Munich’s centre-forward seemed even vaguely stoppable seems like a very long
  time ago. The optics of his imperious second-half hat-trick in this opening
  game were very welcome, particularly in the light of the Bundesliga’s
  groundbreaking new TV deal which meant viewers in the England captain’s home
  country could see Kane do his thing on the BBC or on a choice of two different
  YouTube platforms. Yet the remarkable thing about Bayern’s first-night salvo
  is that they still would have destroyed RB Leipzig, one of their more
  challenging domestic hurdles of recent years, had Kane not showed up to the
  party. It was the dictionary definition of ruthlessness but Ole Werner, the
  new Leipzig coach, could have done nothing in his half-time team talk to
  change the course of events. By the interval, Michael Olise’s double and a
  brilliant Luis Díaz debut strike in between already had Bayern home and hosed.
  Kane’s contribution was merely extra cream and cherry if you were Bayern, or
  salt if you were Leipzig. Technically the visitors might have had cause for
  complaint, with Antonio Nusa’s thunderous second-half strike disallowed;
  rightly, because Castello Lukeba had taken several touches rather than passing
  from a free-kick award directly before but wrongly, because the officials were
  only alerted by Joshua Kimmich’s “unusually strong protests” (per a DFB
  statement), making it an instance of VAR working outside its agreed remits.
  With that said, Leipzig would look ridiculous if they were to protest. And who
  would want a replay of this nightmare? Werner is marshalling a significant
  rebuild and in that sense the timing of this trip to Munich was cruel, like
  taking an exam having had 10 minutes to revise. It would be unfair to judge
  the new coach or his team on this but rivalling Bayern will not be their job
  this season. Their job, and Werner’s, is to forget this and move on. Bayern
  were simply magnificent, even without Jamal Musiala to call on. Olise was
  scintillating, untouchable, and Vincent Kompany made a point of praising Serge
  Gnabry, frequently linked with a move away but renewed here as Musiala’s
  locum. “When we went into the locker room at half-time,” added Kimmich, “I
  already told him that he was playing exceptionally well.” The rest of the
  opening weekend gave no indication that anyone – at least for now – could do
  what Werner’s side failed to do and at least make Bayern uncomfortable. Bayer
  Leverkusen were, perhaps, the weekend’s biggest losers for Erik ten Hag’s
  first Bundesliga game at the helm after a surprise 2-1 defeat at home by
  unfancied Hoffenheim. “A game in which not everything was bad, but definitely
  not much was good either,” in the words of their newly arrived goalkeeper Mark
  Flekken. Leverkusen took an early lead through Jarell Quansah but they never
  looked comfortable, and the visitors equalised when Quansah deflected Fisnik
  Asllani’s shot past Flekken and into his own net. Tim Lemperle hit the
  second-half winner, having hit a post inside two minutes, and Ten Hag’s team
  rarely looked like creating anything outside of set pieces – Quansah’s opener
  had been headed in from an Álex Grimaldo free-kick. If the starting lineup
  didn’t look too unfamiliar, with Flekken and Quansah two of only three new
  signings starting, the drop-off in quality is clear, with only Patrik Schick,
  Edmond Tapsoba and Piero Hincapié (with the latter coveted by Arsenal) regular
  starters in the back half of last season. Die Werkself’s famous punch from the
  bench is no more either, with new boy Ernest Poku the only non-teenager of the
  outfield substitutes. Ten Hag needs a productive last week of the transfer
  window. The window has been frustrating for Borussia Dortmund too, but not as
  frustrating as their Saturday opener at St Pauli. BVB, following on from their
  sensational run-in to snatch a Champions League place last season, were
  striding towards a win as they led 3-1 with five minutes of normal time to go,
  despite Serhou Guirassy missing a penalty after his headed opener. Then
  defensive debutant Filippo Mané was shown a red card for holding back Abdoulie
  Ceesay as he prepared to shoot and Danel Sinani scored the resulting penalty
  before Eric Smith scored his now-customary piledriver against Dortmund to tie
  it up. “This shouldn’t happen to a top team,” chided Niko Kovac, and he wasn’t
  the only unhappy one. On Jobe Bellingham’s Bundesliga debut he was substituted
  at half-time, with his parents, Mark and Denise, coming through to talk to
  Sebastian Kehl after full time. Bild reported that Bellingham’s father gave
  the sporting director his views on the switch and Dortmund’s performance. It
  was clear Kehl had been blindsided. “We are all disappointed with the result,”
  he said, “but the [changing rooms and area around them] is and remains
  reserved for players, coaches and management, not families and advisers. That
  won’t happen again. We have clearly informed everyone involved of this.”
  Jobe’s arrival is a test for Dortmund. Can they still develop elite talent
  having wandered from that as their modus operandi? The tension around the club
  – with goalscorer Julian Brandt talking about taking bad habits of recent
  times “with us into the new season” – means a strong lead from Kovac and Kehl
  is important to get this season on the right road. Not everything is perfect
  at Bayern; after Kane’s post-Super Cup comments that the squad “is a bit
  light” Max Eberl is expected to go back to the board today and ask for further
  funds, with another forward a priority. This is with the long game and the
  rigours of a long campaign in mind because for now, there is no touching for
  Bayern. For the rest of the Bundesliga, September can’t come soon enough.
  Talking points • If anyone looks ready to challenge, it’s the young bucks of
  Eintracht Frankfurt. Making light of Hugo Ekitiké’s exit, they hammered Werder
  Bremen 4-1 with 19-year-old Can Uzun (a sensational opening goal and two
  assists) and 20-year-old Jean-Mattéo Bahoya (two goals) leading the way. No
  prizes for spotting their next €80m-plus sales. • The return of Hamburg after
  seven years away (in the season HSV went down Schalke were runners-up in the
  Bundesliga and Pep Guardiola won his first Premier League title with
  Manchester City, to give you some idea of how much has happened since) was
  encouraging as they took a goalless draw at Borussia Mönchengladbach. “It can
  only get better,” grumped the Gladbach captain, Rocco Reitz. • In fact both
  promoted teams – in what is the rarest of occurrences in the modern European
  game – kept a clean sheet on opening day, with Köln taking all three points
  via Marius Bülter’s late headed winner at last season’s surprise team Mainz.
  The real head-turner, though, was Effzeh’s new coach, Lukas Kwasniok, who wore
  the team’s home shirt on the touchline. “I saw the jersey presentation at a
  sponsors’ evening and got goosebumps,” he said. “Then the decision was clear
  to me. I’d do it, if I was allowed to” (note; he was, as Köln were wearing
  their black and gold away strip, with Kwasniok expected to switch to that to
  avoid a clash when they play at home against Freiburg next week).
