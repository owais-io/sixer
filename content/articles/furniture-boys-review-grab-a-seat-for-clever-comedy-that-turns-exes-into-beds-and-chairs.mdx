  Furniture Boys review – grab a seat for clever comedy that turns exes into
  beds and chairs

  It’s a sight for sore backs. Fringegoers accustomed to fold-out chairs like
  those in the Underbelly’s Buttercup venue may ache for the cosy golden sofa
  that has pride of place on a stage stuffed with bric-a-brac. That would help
  prove actor-writer Emily Weitzman’s point. This is a show that explores our
  intimate relationship with furniture by turning her past boyfriends into a
  locked drawer that never opens up, a rug that everyone walks over and a fridge
  (so, so cold). That’s a witty idea but, like an ingenious storage system,
  Weitzman’s show keeps revealing hidden depths. She also achieves a feat that
  many fringe comedians don’t manage as she makes a whole out of familiar
  elements: a wacky concept, heartfelt memoir, multimedia diversions, the story
  of her show’s own creation and a closing cri de coeur for artistic pursuits.
  It is a very well-made play. A stained sofa bed that can’t decide if it’s one
  or the other brings Weitzman a noncommittal relationship consummated in a
  basement to the sound of a washing machine. With scene-setting prowess and an
  off-kilter energy that recalls Kristen Schaal and Chelsea Peretti, she
  recounts hookups with furniture arranged by app (Hinge, natch) or meet-cutes
  with items left on the street. But the show has pleasingly tactile material on
  all these objects we touch, watch, rely on or sleep with night by night – the
  memories they hold for us, their lives with past owners, their future when
  they outlive us. Our bodies seem positively fragile in comparison. One-liners
  in a straight standup section compare guys with chairs, finding the former
  considerably less sturdy. There’s a shimmeringly silly chanson routine with
  sofa puppets on hands and feet. And Weitzman offers plenty of wordplay in the
  covetous world of high-end furniture, “velourgasms” and all. Directed by Kate
  Doyle, it’s a beautifully controlled production that’s alternately ridiculous
  and revelatory and only requires a little more whittling in the final minutes.
  You’ll leave seeing your own clutter in a new light. • At Underbelly, George
  Square, Edinburgh, until 25 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
