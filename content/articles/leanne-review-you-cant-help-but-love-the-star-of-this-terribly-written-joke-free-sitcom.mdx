  Leanne Morgan came to standup relatively late. Born and raised in rural
  Tennessee, she got married at 26 to her college sweetheart and raised three
  children while the couple built a jewellery business together. It was the
  door-to-door selling she did and the Tupperware parties she hosted for extra
  income that first got her a local reputation for being funny and then led to
  bookings at comedy gigs. But it wasn’t until 2018, when she hired a social
  media relations team to promote clips of her act online and they went viral,
  that her comedy career took off and real fame beckoned. Two years ago, when
  she was 57, Netflix first broadcast her hour-long standup show I’m Every
  Woman, which she was performing on a 100-city tour. It shows the audience
  eating out of her hand as she takes them down the highways and byways of
  marital and menopausal life. Now she is the lead in a new Chuck Lorre-produced
  sitcom Leanne. It is best to be upfront about these things and say that the
  opening episode is bad. Worse than you’ve just assumed when I said “bad.” Gone
  is the lightness of touch, the consummate ease, the subtly immaculate timing
  of her stage show; instead, we have a leaden script punctuated by a desperate
  laughter track, and a one-note performance by Morgan as “Leanne”, a menopausal
  woman closing in on 60, whose husband, Bill (Ryan Stiles), has just run off
  with a younger woman after 33 years of what his wife had thought was a
  perfectly happy marriage. Rounding out what is shaping up to be a 16-episode
  car crash between derivative sit and vanishingly little com are a set of stock
  family members. There is son Tyler (Graham Rogers), adored by his mother,
  henpecked by his wife; deadbeat daughter Josie (Hannah Pilkes), forever
  drunk/high and/or wondering whether she’s pregnant, and ageing parents Daddy
  John (Blake Clark), ornery and tough, and Mama Margaret (Celia Weston), sweet
  and frail. Then there’s twice-divorced, pill-popping sister Carol, played by
  the usually glorious Kristen Johnston, who here spends 22 minutes reduced to
  constant gurning in the absence of any actual jokes to deliver. When a perky
  neighbour at church tells her “I’m basking in the sunshine of our saviour!”,
  Johnston distends her face to its not-inconsiderable maximum as she replies:
  “Working on a melanoma, good.” Well, you’ve got to do something. God, who’d be
  an actor? There are a few stabs at pathos – Bill says he will still be around
  “for the important stuff”, Leanne replies “I thought I was the important
  stuff” – more lines where the intended comedic effect is revealed only by the
  laughter track, and then it is, mercifully, over. If you can get past this
  initial horror, however, things get better. Partly, I think, genuinely and
  quantifiably. The actors find a rhythm, the strain on everyone involved
  becomes less apparent and the jokes become recognisable as jokes. Not good
  jokes, not ones I would quote here, confident that they could survive the
  transition to print, but keep in mind that at one point in the first episode
  the exchange “You can’t keep a secret”, “Watch me!” was scored as such, so we
  are working within the narrowest margins here. And once your expectations are
  suitably lowered, it takes on a charm of its own. The colours are bright. The
  multi-camera format reminds you of happier, simpler times from your youth.
  Morgan and Johnston are in almost every scene and have comedy chops that can
  overcome even the most defiantly second- and third-tier writing and reward
  your viewing investment with glimmers of merriment. It starts to take on a
  rosy hue. Are you entertained, or just glad that the first 22 minutes are
  safely past and need never be seen again? Who’s to say? Whatever is happening,
  it’s … sort of nice. Will Carol drag her sister out on a disastrous date night
  before she’s ready? Why, yes, yes she will. Leanne ruins the vibe by showing
  the guy pictures of her beloved grandson (“Named after his granddaddy, who may
  rot in hell!”). Did you see the second half of that line coming? Of course you
  did. But now it’s kind of comforting instead of eye-rollingly inadequate when
  it arrives, no? Let’s just try one more episode and see if it gets a little
  better after this one, too. I think it does! Or is my brain melting? And does
  it matter? I feel happy. I am happy. All of which is to say – I’ve no idea
  what star rating to give this thing. One? Or five? Perhaps I should average it
  out to three, even though it feels overall like a two? But Leanne – or
  “Leanne” – is doing her best! And she’s so good in her special! And I’m so
  glad she’s out there, flying the flag for older women! And I love her accent.
  That may be what is casting most of the spell, now that I think about it. So
  be it. Two stars for the show, one for the honeyed drawl. There you go. •
