  Asked on the radio what should happen to asylum seekers accommodated in a
  Hertfordshire hotel, if a court were to rule that they must be moved out, the
  Conservative leader of Broxbourne Council, Corina Gander, said flatly: “That’s
  the government’s problem.” Ms Gander had indicated that she would seek to
  challenge the use of the hotel following Epping council’s successful legal
  precedent. Other local authorities will surely follow suit. As Britain’s
  immigration debate turns ever more ugly, that is a problem for the nation as
  well as the government. Far-right groups were energetically involved in this
  summer’s protests outside the Essex hotel, which followed the arrest of an
  Ethiopian asylum seeker for alleged sexual offences. The high court ruling has
  handed them a major opportunity that they will certainly seize. Home Office
  lawyers were stating the obvious when warning that Mr Justice Eyre’s decision
  to grant the council’s shutdown request “ran the risk of acting as an impetus
  for further violent protests”. Cue Nigel Farage. While posing as a benign
  patriot in the saloon bar, Reform UK’s leader continues to do his utmost to
  foment social discord in the hope of political gain. His call for nationwide
  demonstrations “to get the illegal immigrants out”, in the wake of the Epping
  ruling, underlines that the migrant debate in Britain is now more toxic than
  at any point since the 1970s. The repeated targeting of accommodation this
  summer and last has, thankfully, yet to result in a tragedy. But the kind of
  rhetoric now being deployed against young, male asylum seekers by senior
  politicians across the right is making one more likely. Against such a dismal
  backdrop, Labour finds itself in a deeply invidious position. It is possible
  that a judicial review of the Epping case in the autumn may overturn Mr
  Justice Eyre’s ruling. Failing that, the government is likely to need
  alternative forms of accommodation for thousands of refugees far sooner than
  it intended, having already pledged to end the use of hotels by 2029. Relying
  on private contractors to move more asylum seekers into flats and houses, in
  an already overheated rental sector, will create its own tensions. The memory
  of the notorious Manston holding centre – now the subject of an independent
  inquiry into allegations of overcrowding, abuse and misconduct – should act as
  a cautionary tale amid rightwing calls for “detention camps”. As a first
  strategic step, Labour should activate coming break clauses with the three
  main private providers that governments have relied upon. The successful
  integration of asylum seekers into communities requires a level of public
  planning and local investment that has been woefully absent. Epping must be
  the catalyst for a new settlement with affected councils, involving a far more
  collaborative approach and a considerably more engaged state. Most
  importantly, perhaps, ministers must begin to make an unabashed moral case for
  compassion towards vulnerable and exposed human beings. Mr Justice Eyre’s
  unanticipated decision, made on the grounds of preventing further disruptive
  demonstrations in Epping, will have the likely effect of amplifying protests
  elsewhere. Among a significant minority of the population, refugees are
  increasingly being treated as a pariah group, undeserving of empathy and
  assistance. That is not how the majority of Britons think. In testing times,
  Labour needs to speak more loudly on their behalf and trust its own better
  instincts. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article? If you
