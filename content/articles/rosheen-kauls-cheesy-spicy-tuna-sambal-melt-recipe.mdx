  Tuna melts are arguably my favourite sandwich, all melty, pickley and
  delicious. A general gripe I have is when there isn’t enough mayonnaise in the
  tuna mixture and it ends up tasting canned and metallic – so use lots and
  don’t be shy. But tuna sambal is so packed with flavour already, you run very
  little risk of metallic canned fish flavours spoiling your toastie. The cheese
  does a marvellous job of tempering the spice from the sambal, leaving you with
  a far gentler meal. First make the sambal, which is a mixture inspired by a
  dish from Manado in Indonesia that I have fond memories of – called cakalang
  rica-rica. The original dish is a fiery, dry stir-fry of smoked skipjack tuna;
  hugely flavourful and eye-wateringly spicy. You don’t need to make this sambal
  anywhere near as hot, but if you want to you can, by adding a couple of
  fistfuls of bird’s-eye or Thai chillies. You’ll need a cast-iron skillet or a
  sandwich press for the toastie. Remember, mayonnaise is the gold standard for
  a perfectly golden toasted sandwich exterior. It forms an iron-clad surface
  that keeps your sandwich nice and crisp. Rosheen Kaul’s tuna sambal – recipe
  Makes 2 cups (500ml) 8 small Asian shallots or 4 French shallots 10 long red
  chillies 4 red bird’s-eye chillies 4 cloves garlic 1 tomato 2 lemongrass
  stalks, tender white part only of one, the other thinly sliced ½ tsp turmeric
  powder 1½ tbsp neutral oil, for frying 3 makrut lime leaves, thinly sliced ½
  red onion, diced 500g good-quality tinned tuna in oil (or mackerel or
  sardines), drained 1 tsp fish sauce 1 tsp sugar 1 tsp salt Juice of 1 lime 1
  tsp crispy shallots (store-bought) Place the shallots, chillies, garlic,
  tomato, white part of one lemongrass stalk and turmeric powder in a food
  processor or mortar and pestle and blend to a smooth paste. Heat the oil to
  smoking point in a medium frying pan, then saute the lime leaves and sliced
  lemongrass over high heat until fragrant. Add the onion and continue
  stir-frying until softened slightly, then add a couple of tablespoons of the
  sambal. Stir-fry for one to two minutes, then add the tuna. Continue frying
  over medium-high heat until any liquid evaporates and the tuna begins to dry
  out somewhat in the pan. Break up any larger pieces of tuna as you continue to
  fry, then add the fish sauce and sugar. Taste at this point, add a little more
  sambal if you wish, and skip the salt if the tuna is already salty. If you add
  more sambal or seasoning, fry for a further few minutes until it’s lovely and
  dry. Once you’re happy, add the lime juice and fold through the crispy
  shallots to serve. The tuna sambal will keep for up to five days in the fridge
  in an airtight container. Reheat it well before you eat it. Tuna sambal melt –
  recipe Serves 1 ½ cup (125ml) tuna sambal (recipe above) 2 tbsp mayonnaise ½
  tsp chopped pickled capers or jalapeños ½ tsp finely minced French or Asian
  shallots 1 tbsp finely chopped parsley and dill 2 slices bread 4 slices
  American or cheddar cheese Flaky salt, to taste Combine the tuna sambal, half
  the mayonnaise, chopped pickled capers or jalapeños, shallot and herbs in a
  small bowl. Taste and adjust the seasoning as you like. Add sliced fresh
  chillies too, if you’re feeling spicy. Spread the remaining mayonnaise on all
  surfaces of the bread, then assemble the sandwich, beginning with two slices
  of cheese on the base, then the sambal tuna filling, followed by the remaining
  two slices of cheese. Top with the second slice of mayonnaised bread. Heat a
  cast-iron skillet over medium heat, or use a sandwich press. Gently place the
  sandwich on the hot surface of the pan, then press down and cook until it has
  a crisp, golden surface and melty cheese inside. If you’re using a skillet,
  cook for about four minutes either side, carefully flipping in between, and
  make sure you keep pressing down on the sandwich as it cooks. Transfer to a
  chopping board and sprinkle with a little flaky salt if you have it. Cut in
  half and eat immediately. This is an edited extract from Secret Sauce by
