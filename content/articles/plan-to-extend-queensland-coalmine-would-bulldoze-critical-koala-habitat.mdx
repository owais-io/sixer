  Habitat for threatened koalas that are part of a population described by one
  expert as nationally significant would be bulldozed under plans to extend a
  Queensland coalmine. The campaign group Lock the Gate used drones with thermal
  imaging cameras to find 13 koalas in one night in trees earmarked for clearing
  by mining company Glencore. Glencore wants to clear 680 hectares of land –
  including 600ha of koala habitat – to expand its Hail Creek mine west of
  Mackay. Lock the Gate surveyed about a quarter of the area to be cleared in
  June using the drones. “This is by far the most koalas we’ve ever seen in the
  path of a planned coalmine,” said the group’s Queensland coordinator, Maggie
  Mckeown. Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air
  column as a free newsletter “The habitat next to Hail Creek coalmine is
  clearly a critical home for koalas.” In 2022 the federal government raised the
  threat status for koalas in Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT to
  endangered after estimates suggested their numbers in those states had halved
  between 2001 and 2021. Land clearing is one of the key threats facing the
  koala, alongside disease, traffic, logging and dog attacks. Dr Bill Ellis, who
  leads the Koala Ecology Group at the University of Queensland, said the koalas
  at Hail Creek were part of the Clarke Connors Range population that was
  nationally significant because of its size and health, and was a genetically
  distinct group that existed across a range of habitats. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email The high number of koalas detected by the drones confirmed the
  health of the population, he said. He was sceptical that offsets – an option
  being considered by Glencore that puts alternative habitat aside – would be
  enough to protect the koalas. He said approving further coalmining would
  probably increase traffic on the Peak Downs Highway that connects Bowen Basin
  mines to Mackay and is a known death hotspot for koalas. In an environmental
  assessment submitted to the Queensland government, consultants for Glencore
  said the impacts from the clearing would be “unavoidable and would adversely
  affect habitat critical to the survival of this species”. About 600ha of
  habitat for the vulnerable squatter pigeon will also be cleared if the plans
  are approved, the assessment said. UN-backed research revealed earlier this
  year that emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane from the mine were
  likely between three and eight times higher than officially reported. The
  extension plans are still before the state government and have not yet been
  sent to the federal government for environmental assessment. But Lock the
  Gate, the Queensland Conservation Council (QCC) and the Mackay Conservation
  Group have written to the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, to ask
  for a moratorium on project applications in the area “until the population
  size, health and habitat [of koalas] can be thoroughly investigated”. Charlie
  Cox, coal and gas campaigner at QCC, said koalas deserved the highest levels
  of protection but “in central Queensland they’re losing habitat to coalmining
  companies who bulldoze their homes and fuel the climate crisis”. A Queensland
  government spokesperson said a decision on Glencore’s application to amend its
  state environmental authority was expected by late 2025. A Glencore
  spokesperson said: “We are very aware of the importance of existing koala
  habitat. We are working closely with state and federal governments to deliver
  an effective environmental management plan to minimise impact on flora and
  fauna in the Hail Creek project area.” The Guardian approached Watt for
  comment but was referred to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the
  Environment and Water. A department spokesperson said it was aware of
  Glencore’s project, adding: “Any action that is likely to have a significant
  impact on a matter protected under national environment law must be referred
  to the department for consideration under the national environment law.”
