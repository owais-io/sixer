  It was a deadly moment that unfortunately came as no surprise. At about 3am
  the unmistakable crump of explosions could be heard across Kyiv, enough to
  wake up tens of thousands and leave them contemplating whether to head for
  shelter or to stay in bed hoping for the best. At a five-storey residential
  apartment block in the Darnytskyi area in the east of the city, residents said
  they had heard Russian bombing in the distance. It was a familiar sound, and
  many had gathered away from the windows in central corridors that extended
  along the block, only for disaster to strike. “We didn’t understand what had
  happened,” said Oleksandr Yastremskyi, who had taken refuge in a corridor with
  his wife, Tetiana, and their son Denys. “It’s like something had landed into
  our house. And then we heard people screaming.” A hundred metres away, the
  other end of their building collapsed, sending, according to Tetiana, “a big
  wave of dust and smoke” in their direction. The next day, shocked residents
  described how two explosions destroyed one end of the apartment block, killing
  17. Ivan Zhelezko, a serving soldier, looked across at his bombed second-floor
  flat, its balcony hanging at an unsustainable angle. Around him in bags were a
  handful of possessions he had managed to take with him from the apartment
  where he lived with his family for 20 years. Zhelezko said he was too stunned
  to be angry, describing himself as confused. Among those who died, he said,
  were his friend’s sister and the parents of a childhood friend. The soldier
  explained that his family escaped because they left immediately after the
  first explosion, and he tried to insist the tragedy was “nothing new for me”.
  Such fatalism was hard to believe, though he added: “I’m just happy my family
  is alive.” Those who moved fast or were simply at the other end of the
  building may have been able to escape unhurt but, such was the ferocity of the
  blasts, taking down all five storeys, they could only have been caused by a
  cruise or ballistic missile attack, giving those in the path of the rockets no
  chance. At the scene of the bombing, Yulia Maystruk clutched her
  three-and-a-half-month-old baby daughter, Maria. She explained that that she
  knew “a woman who had taken shelter in the basement with her 14-year-old-son”
  nearer the impact point. The mother had survived but was injured, needing
  medical care. As for the son “he died in hospital”, she said, her eyes welling
  with tears. The 14-year-old was one of four children out of 17 civilians who
  were killed in the apartment block because they had the misfortune to be at
  the wrong end of the building. Ten other people remained unaccounted for and a
  search operation involving 200 rescue workers, gradually tearing down the
  ruined part of the building as they looked for survivors, was expected to
  continue into Friday. It had been quiet in Kyiv throughout most of August. In
  the run-up to the failed Alaska peace summit, Donald Trump had complained
  about Vladimir Putin’s bombing of Ukrainian cities and even threatened to levy
  sanctions on Russia oil before the meeting. The threats appeared to have some
  effect on the Kremlin and major attacks on Ukraine’s urban centres halted.
  Quiet nights returned. However, in Alaska Putin had refused to agree to a
  ceasefire unless Ukraine agreed to his extreme demands, including the
  surrender of the heavily defended portion of the eastern Donetsk province it
  still holds. Trump proved unwilling to pressure the Kremlin into softening its
  position – and so it was only a matter of time before Russia would feel
  confident enough to strike Kyiv again and see how the US president reacted. In
  the small hours of Thursday, it was clear the Kremlin was going all out.
  Ukraine’s air force said the country had been targeted with 629 Russian
  missiles and drones overnight. It was the worst attack on Kyiv since 31 July
  when 32 people were killed. Emergency services responded in more than 23
  locations and at least 18 people have been killed. Just before 5.40am the
  bombing switched to the city centre, a mile south-east of Kyiv’s main railway
  station, into an affluent district of business properties and expensive
  apartments. A drone or missile struck close to an apartment building across
  the road from the five-storey British Council offices; the ensuing blast
  shattered all its front windows, bringing down its ceilings and inflicted
  serious damage. Residents in the district headed out to the dusty,
  glass-strewn streets, according to one observer, many wearing pyjamas and
  slippers, wrapped in blankets to call family members to describe what was
  happening. There was no obvious nearby target for the attack and the damage to
  the British Council building means that a diplomatic row between the UK and
  Russia is now inevitable. Back across the city, Maystruk acknowledged: “I
  didn’t think this would happen to me,” and worried for the future of the baby
  she held tight. A cousin, she explained, lived on the outskirts of London.
  Perhaps she could move there for her family’s safety? She rejected the
  suggestion: “Our patriotism is more powerful than our fear.” Additional
