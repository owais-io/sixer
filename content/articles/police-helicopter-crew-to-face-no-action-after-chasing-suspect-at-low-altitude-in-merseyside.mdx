  A police helicopter crew will face no action after flying at low altitude
  while pursuing a suspect on a motorbike in Merseyside. Video footage was
  published on social media last week showing a National Police Air Service
  (Npas) helicopter pursuing the man, which resulted in the detention of the
  suspect for numerous alleged offences including dangerous driving, driving a
  motor vehicle which had been taken without the owner’s consent, driving while
  disqualified, failing to stop and conspiring to intentionally/recklessly cause
  a public nuisance. A second suspect was arrested for alleged theft of a motor
  vehicle and assisting an offender. Npas’s air crew had been deployed to assist
  Merseyside police following reports of a man riding a scrambler bike in a
  dangerous and reckless manner near Carr Mill Dam in St Helens. Police air crew
  normally fly at a safer height of at least 60 metres during routine patrols
  but can descend when pursuing a vehicle or conducting surveillance. Following
  an internal review of the incident, which occurred on 13 August, the Npas
  said: “We are satisfied that the crew acted appropriately, conducted a dynamic
  risk assessment and operated within the parameters and regulations for our
  operational deployments.” Ch Supt Fiona Gaffney, chief operating officer for
  Npas, said: “Our crew tracked the motorcyclist for over an hour, providing
  continuous updates to ground officers. This was a legitimate policing task in
  support of public safety and crime prevention. “Once in a safe location, the
  crew recorded the decision to lower altitude with the intention of landing. As
  the motorcyclist continued to make off, the landing was discontinued and the
  aircraft accelerated before climbing away. This is an accepted takeoff
  manoeuvre.” Gaffney added: “The fast-paced and unpredictable nature of vehicle
  pursuits can require crews to make rapid decisions to ensure public safety. We
  have robust procedures in place to support these decisions and safety remains
  our highest priority.” A spokesperson for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said
  it is aware of the incident, which is the subject of a police investigation,
  adding: “The Civil Aviation Authority will review the outcome and the
  processes that were followed.”
