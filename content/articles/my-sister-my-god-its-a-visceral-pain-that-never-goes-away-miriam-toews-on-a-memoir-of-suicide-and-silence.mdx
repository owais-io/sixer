  Long before she became one of Canada’s most celebrated authors, Miriam Toews
  was an 18-year-old with a restless streak, set on fleeing the strictures of
  her conservative Mennonite community. Toews’s family descended from Russian
  Mennonites and spoke Plautdietsch, an unwritten language. They grew up in a
  world with little privacy, many unofficial rules and the threat of
  excommunication. Toews and a boyfriend had planned a bike trip across Europe,
  one in which they would sit on the grave of John Keats and smoke too many
  cigarettes. Before she left, her older sister Marj asked a favor: would Toews
  write letters to her while she was away? Marj, then 24, had recently moved
  back home and was in a period of deep depression. She had stopped talking, but
  she would still write. “She was so sick,” says Toews, sitting across from me
  at a picnic table in Toronto’s Trinity Bellwoods park. Toews began writing to
  her sister, partly because she loved talking to her and partly because she
  hoped it would save her life. “Which, of course, is a ridiculous idea,” says
  Toews. “That me writing letters would keep her alive. But I really took it
  seriously.” Anyone with a formidable older sister knows their unrivaled power.
  They are a portal to the wider world, brave in their primacy. Marj Toews was
  one such older sister. She was six years older than Miriam, who worshipped her
  from day one. “She was so much the subject of my investigation into this
  world,” Toews tells me. “I needed her. Who she was to me was something so
  necessary.” Marj has never stopped being a subject of necessary investigation
  for Miriam Toews: both her remarkable life, and her death by suicide at the
  age of 52. Since that European excursion with her ex-boyfriend, Toews has
  authored 10 books, one of which, Women Talking, was adapted into an
  Oscar-winning film starring Frances McDormand and Rooney Mara. Her latest, A
  Truce That Is Not Peace, was released on Tuesday and is her first memoir
  written from her perspective. (Her first work of nonfiction, Swing Low, was
  written in the voice of her father). Toews is also an enthusiastic grandmother
  of four. She lives near downtown Toronto, with her 90-year old mother, Elvira;
  her partner; and her daughter Georgia’s family, including their two young
  sons. When Toews and I first encounter each other, a snaking line of
  hand-holding toddlers in fluorescent safety vests are weaving their way into
  the park. A smiling Toews stands vigil as they pass, trying to spot her
  grandson in the mix. It’s a muggy morning, and we, like the children, are in
  search of shade. At 61, Toews is older now than her older sister ever was, and
  around the same age her father was when he too died of suicide. Melvin Toews
  was a beloved schoolteacher in their home town of Steinbach in the Manitoba
  province of central Canada. He was a deeply devout man, a proud champion of
  his daughters and his wife, and somebody who experienced bipolar disorder his
  entire life. “My dad sort of had to be mentally ill in secret in that
  community,” says Toews. There was the danger of it being misinterpreted as a
  lack of faith. “If your faith was stronger, if you were a better Mennonite,
  you wouldn’t be depressed,” she says. His illness sometimes brought him into
  sustained periods of silence. The whole first year after Toews was born, he
  did not speak. It makes sense that though we are ostensibly here to talk about
  A Truce That Is Not Peace, our conversation stays mostly with both of them:
  the complexity of their deaths and the totality of how much they are missed.
  No matter how much time has passed, their absence is still raw. Becoming a
  grandmother has only intensified this feeling: Toews cannot help but think
  about how much Marj would have enjoyed this next stage of caregiving. Toews’s
  work is often centered on the question of why her father and her sister both
  chose to end their lives, and in A Truce That Is Not Peace, she acknowledges
  that she will never find the answer. It is that very paradox that keeps her on
  the page, turning it over again to try to understand them as they wished to be
  understood, and to stay close to them now that they are gone. When she wrote
  the book, Toews had just turned 60. She was tending to both her young
  grandchildren and her elderly mother, whom she has previously called the love
  of her life. (Elvira Toews, a Lamborghini-loving, Toronto Blue Jays fan who
  bucked tradition to go to graduate school and become a social worker, leaps
  off the page in so many of Toews’s books. She is the kind of woman who eats a
  daily bowl of vanilla ice-cream with chocolate syrup, banana slices and
  walnuts, and when it’s over says: “How ’bout another one?”) Miriam Toews was
  already one of Canada’s bestselling authors, but the success of Women Talking
  launched her into a new level of international recognition, winning all of
  Canada’s top literary prizes and plaudits from everyone from Margaret Atwood
  to Brad Pitt, who was a co-producer on the film adaptation. Yet, she could not
  shake the feeling that her need to continue to write was somehow newly
  shameful. “I was grappling with the urgency of it,” says Toews in regards to
  her writing, “And on the other hand the mortification. Why do I still need to
  write? Why do I still need to make this thing in order to connect with other
  human beings so I don’t feel so alone and weird? It’s so embarrassing.” She
  asked herself: hadn’t she said it all? What was left in her life to mine? Her
  nine previous books had already reflected back on many of her own experiences.
  Maybe it was time to finally heed the message she had received all those early
  years from her Mennonite forefathers: keep quiet. That would be dignified,
  Toews insisted. “I just wish I could be like a calm, serene, bemused
  grandmotherly person with wisdom,” says Toews. “But it seems as though – it
  seems like I haven’t really achieved that. And I have to understand that I
  never will.” At some point, we had to stop to laugh: it seemed too wonderfully
  Toewsian that while she was talking about the indignity of an older female
  writer still expressing herself, we were surrounded by individuals who were
  contorting themselves into strange, acrobatic shapes. One was a shirtless man
  bending over a park bench like a stretchy rainbow, the other dangling
  frog-legged and upside down from a fabric sling strung up in a tree. “God,”
  says Toews. “It’s so perfect.” This time around, Toews is changing the way she
  tells these stories. Most of her previous books contain autobiographical
  information told through the prism of fiction. A Truce That Is Not Peace takes
  an inverse approach. The central conceit is a fictional prompt from a
  fictional conference in Mexico City, a send-up of the highfalutin literary
  circles Toews now finds herself in. The idea is something like this:
  organizers of this “Conversación” want her to provide an answer for why she
  writes. She sends them many attempts: associative, rangy, exasperated, rueful,
  funny ruminations on the futility of writing. Eventually, the committee
  uninvites her. The book is in many ways about the inherent failures of
  language. Marj Toews, like her father Melv before her, would fall into long
  periods of silence in her suffering. A Truce That Is Not Peace is constantly
  weighing Toews’s own urgent need to write against her sister’s and her
  father’s choice to periodically forsake words altogether. “Silence. Suicide.
  Writing. Within all of these, we are holding,” writes Toews. “Does her silence
  hold the perfect expression of her suffering? Is her silence a communications
  success, my writing a failure?” Silence, suicide and writing: these are
  sisters of sorts in Toews’s questioning mind: “Are writing and suicide
  related?” she asks. “The same thing? Or estranged relatives, at least? Angry
  siblings whose origins are the same. An attempt – a fragment of an attempt –
  to save life, preserve life, to freeze it in a moment, to end what is real, to
  survive by ending. To preserve, in silence, what is authentic.” Yet Toews is
  not cynical about the project of writing. It is nothing short of a choice to
  keep on living, long after we have buried our beloved dead. “Why must I draw a
  comparison between writing and suicide?” asks Toews. “To stay with her. To
  stay with them. Yes, you can imagine my suffering. Yeah, you fucking can. Try!
  Stay with me.” Despite their serious subject matter, Toews’s books have a
  rallying spirit to them, an angry jolt of energy that comes from a perpetual
  spirit of adolescent rebellion. In A Truce That Is Not Peace, that looseness
  feels more radical in nature, entirely liberated from plot. Toews has a deep
  distrust of narrative’s more controlling impulses. Perhaps it is because Toews
  has always been sensitive to modes of control, from the strict traditional
  Mennonite orthodoxy she grew up under. Or maybe it is because of the way some
  people in her religious community rushed to come up with neat and inaccurate
  explanations for why her father had died by suicide, which hurt Toews more
  than it provided comfort. Or maybe it was the new experience of having her
  novel about survivors of gas-facilitated sexual assault be made into a feature
  film and fully absorbed into the alienating awards cycle machine. “The reality
  is that [director] Sarah Polley did an amazing job,” says Toews. “We talked
  about it throughout, she was so sensitive to the whole thing, and it was an
  amazing experience.” The irony was not lost on Toews that going to Hollywood
  meant losing her authorial voice on a novel that was literally just women
  talking to one another. A Truce That Is Not Peace’s nonlinear structure makes
  it immune to such dangers. “I was thinking, OK, there’s no way this is going
  to be adapted,” laughs Toews. “Like, adapt this, motherfuckers. Just try.”
  There is of course a complicated answer to why write, and then there’s a
  simple one. “Why do I write?” writes Toews matter-of-factly towards the end of
  A Truce That Is Not Peace. “Because she asked me to.” Marj and Mel Toews
  introduced her to the world of books, a world that Toews thinks saved her
  life. “I love them and I miss them so much,” says Toews. “My sister, my God.
  It’s a visceral pain and it never goes away. It lessens, it lightens, it ebbs
  and flows.” It’s hard to overstate the patriarchal conditions Marj and Miriam
  Toews’s family were all subject to. Many of the women they grew up with lived
  hard lives. Their grandmother – their mother’s mother – buried six of her 13
  children in infancy. Their father’s mother often cried out in her sleep,
  speaking the name of a group of men she grew up with in a little girl’s voice.
  She stole and drank bottles of vanilla extract during the day, lining her
  purse with a tea towel so that the glass would not make a sound. When Marj was
  10, she was abducted off the street by a group of teenage boys in a car who
  dropped her off in front of her house hours later “doused with a vile brown
  liquid”. “Don’t be alarmed if I scream in my sleep,” Toews’s own mother
  cheerfully sometimes tells her family. But the women they grew up with also
  had a deep communion with one another that was borne out of the intense gender
  separation they experienced. They sang together. They raised their families
  alongside one another. And they laughed – a lot. “With my mother, with my
  aunts, with my female cousins, there was a subversive humor that we could all
  rally around and share. It was always against our oppressors, the rules that
  were put on us,” says Toews. Nobody made her laugh harder than Marj. “She was
  so funny,” says Toews. And what was it that made them laugh so hard? “That
  shared thing,” says Toews smiling, in the sly knowing language of sisters,
  “whatever that shared thing is.” A shared sense of humor is an underwater
  cable that connects so many siblings and so many of Toews’s books. It’s the
  language of subterfuge. What better way is there to chip away at an
  unreasonably sanctimonious authority than to laugh at it? Toews tells me that
  when she gave A Truce That Is Not Peace to her mother to read, her mother
  laughed and laughed, telling Toews: “It’s all true!” I ask Toews whether she
  dreams about Marj. “I do,” she tells me. “The details are often the same.
  She’s always telling me she’s OK. And she’s always looking good and happy. I
  would like to have that dream every night. Every night. It’s always a little
  bit hard waking up. But it’s always good to have the dream.” A Truce That Is
  Not Peace is dedicated to Marj. It contains some of those old letters between
  the two of them, back when Miriam was 18 and left for her overseas biking
  trip. Only one is written by Marj. It ends with her saying: “I very much miss
  being able to call you anytime or just come over + hang out. A sister’s place
  is in many ways even better than a friend’s – you’re always welcome, don’t
  have to make arrangements etc. etc. Can stay long or short, clean out the
  fridge, read the paper etc In short, not be on one’s best behaviour.” Toews’s
  writing is a way of building a suspended sister’s place where the
  correspondence is ongoing. It’s a place to go to not be on one’s best
  behavior. It’s both the dream and the waking up. “She taught me how to stay
  alive,” writes Toews. “Silence and words: both are good, both are failures,
  both are efforts, and in that effort is where life lies – not lies, but maybe
  it does – but where it exists. And the fragments in between are the spaces
  where she and I meet.” • In the US, you can call or text the 988 Suicide &amp;
