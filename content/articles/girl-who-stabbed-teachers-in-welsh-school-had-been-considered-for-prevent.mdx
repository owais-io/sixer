  A teenager given a 15-year sentence for attempting to murder three people at
  her school in south-west Wales when she was 13 had been considered for
  referral to the anti-extremism Prevent programme over her interest in Adolf
  Hitler, according to a new inquiry. The girl, now 15, who cannot be named for
  legal reasons, used a knife to stab two teachers and a pupil at Ysgol Dyffryn
  Aman in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, in April 2024. She told police after her
  arrest: “That’s one way to be a celebrity.” She was found guilty of three
  counts of attempted murder by a jury at Swansea crown court in April this
  year. A multi-agency report commissioned by Carmarthenshire county council and
  Mid and West Wales safeguarding board published on Wednesday found that while
  authorities knew a lot about the girl’s state of mind and associated
  behaviours in the two years before the attack, it was not shared between
  agencies. She had “unusual interests in war memorabilia, Hitler, a fascination
  with weapons and purports to speak German and Russian”, the report said. She
  had taken a ball bearing gun with her to a previous school, had threatened to
  use a knife on a child at Ysgol Dyffryn Aman, and was suspended for taking a
  blade to school the year before the attack took place. After the first knife
  possession incident, concerns about potential radicalisation meant a referral
  to Prevent was discussed but it was decided the girl did not meet the criteria
  threshold, the report found. Instead, a referral for an early action help
  assessment was made, but declined by the child’s father, who agreed to carry
  out daily bag checks. He told Gladys Rhodes White, the review author, that he
  felt “services” had let the girl – referred to as Child A – and the family
  down. “He described occasions when he tried to get help for Child A in dealing
  with her emotional and behavioural issues and felt none of the services
  understood Child A and her needs,” the report said. “He feels it is only since
  her conviction that she has started to receive help.” The child declined to
  take part in the review. The report also interviewed teachers at Ysgol Dyffryn
  Aman, who said they were not aware of the girl’s history, and what they did
  know was related to her “emotional and behavioural needs”. On the day of the
  attacks, pupils knew she had a knife with her but did not inform any teachers,
  the report said. Rhodes White concluded that “each agency had their own pieces
  of the jigsaw”, but “it is important to note that no information held by
  agencies identified a clear ability to foresee the shocking and unexpected
  events which occurred in April 2024”. Better information sharing between
  agencies, and a focus on how to to support children who do not meet the
  threshold for Prevent, were needed, she said. In a joint statement,
  Carmarthenshire county council, the school, Dyfed-Powys police and Hywel Dda
  University health board said they would be addressing the report’s
  recommendations. The child will be eligible for release on licence after
  serving half of her 15-yearsentence, but could be recalled to custody. During
  the sentencing, Judge Thomas KC told the teenager: “I believe what you did
  that day you did above all for attention … I think in a weird way you enjoyed
  the reaction and publicity.”
