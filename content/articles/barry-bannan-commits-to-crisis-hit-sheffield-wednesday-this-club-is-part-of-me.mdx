  The Sheffield Wednesday captain, Barry Bannan, has signed a new contract with
  the crisis-hit Championship club. The 35-year-old midfielder has been at
  Wednesday since 2015 and despite the expiration of his previous contract in
  June has been training with the first-team squad during pre-season. Wednesday
  are under a transfer embargo and subject to EFL fee restrictions until the end
  of the summer window after a failure to pay transfer fees on time. There is
  concern whether they will be able to fulfil their opening fixture of the at
  Leicester next Sunday. A pre-season friendly against Burnley, scheduled to
  take place behind closed doors on Saturday, was cancelled after Wednesday
  players reportedly refused to play. Wednesday did not say how long Bannan’s
  new contract was for. The club, who finished 12th last season, are mired in
  financial difficulties and are under transfer restrictions imposed by the
  Football League after failures to pay the wages of their players and staff. In
  the past few days, Wednesday’s manager, Danny Röhl, has left the club and the
  North Stand of Hillsborough closed due to safety concerns. The owner, the Thai
  businessman Dejphon Chansiri, is being urged to sell the club to preserve its
  future. “This club is a big part of me and my family, who are with me here
  today as I’m signing,” Bannan told the Sheffield Wednesday website. “They will
  always stand by me with whatever decision I make and I’ve decided to stay. “We
  had a lot of conversations as a family and when I told my daughter Elsie that
  I might be leaving she started crying. Then last night when I told her I was
  staying she started crying again. I asked her why and she said they are just
  happy tears.” The Scot has been at Hillsborough for a decade, joining from
  Crystal Palace in 2015 and playing in the Championship playoff final loss to
  Hull in his first season. He was handed the captain’s armband as Wednesday
  were relegated to League One. Promotion back to the Championship came when
  Bannan lifted the League One playoff trophy at Wembley in 2023. He has made
  447 appearances.
