  Chelsea are close to an agreement to sign Manchester United’s Alejandro
  Garnacho in a deal likely to be worth between £35m and £40m. Talks are yet to
  conclude but there is an expectation United will lower their £50m asking price
  and reach a compromise that will allow the winger to move to Stamford Bridge.
  Chelsea are waiting to hear back from United and are confident the deal will
  go ahead. Garnacho has no future under Ruben Amorim but Chelsea regard the
  Argentinian as a top talent and believe they can get his career back on track.
  It is understood Chelsea are confident they will not have to wait for the
  proposed sales of Christopher Nkunku and Nicolas Jackson to go through before
  completing a move for Garnacho. Chelsea need to meet the terms of a Uefa
  settlement agreement stipulating they must have a “positive transfer balance”
  to register new players for the Champions League. The club are relaxed about
  the situation, however, with sources at Stamford Bridge stressing that
  suggestions they are under pressure to raise funds have been exaggerated. The
  desire to bring in another winger means Garnacho is viewed as a bigger
  priority than the RB Leipzig midfielder Xavi Simons, who has emerged as a
  target for Tottenham. Enzo Maresca, the Chelsea head coach, uses a system that
  depends heavily on players staying wide and stretching the play. Chelsea want
  four wingers and see Garnacho competing with Jamie Gittens for a spot on the
  left. Garnacho fell out of favour last season and has faced questions over his
  attitude. Yet his talent is not in doubt – he played a crucial role in United
  beating Manchester City in the FA Cup final in 2024 – and Chelsea have done
  extensive background checks on his character. Chelsea believe that Garnacho
  will thrive in a different environment. Maresca wants plenty of depth in
  attack and has signed Liam Delap, João Pedro, Gittens and Estêvão Willian.
  Chelsea hold an interest in Fermín López but Barcelona do not want to sell the
  attacking midfielder. López could be an alternative to Simons. Chelsea are
  confident they will sell Nkunku and Jackson. Nkunku has interest from leading
  European sides, as does Jackson, a target for Aston Villa, Bayern Munich,
  Newcastle, Juventus and Napoli. Bayern are interested in a loan for Jackson,
  something Chelsea will only agree to if there is an obligation to buy. Roma,
  Leizpig and teams in England are interested in the 19-year-old winger Tyrique
  George. Chelsea are still waiting for firm interest to materialise in Raheem
  Sterling. Fulham are a possible destination for Sterling.
