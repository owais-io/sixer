  At the age of 39, I’ve been told I should start wearing glasses when working
  or driving. On finding out, I suddenly faced a world of decisions – and they
  all involved a cost. As well as theeye test, I needed to pay for frames –
  costing from about £20 to £200 at the optician’s I was in – and decide whether
  to go for extras such as anti-reflection coatings for the lenses or
  extra-light frames. Most people (86%) buy their glasses from the same
  optician’s where they have an eye test, according to research by UK regulator
  the General Optical Council (GOC), and only 8% buy online despite the lower
  costs. But I wanted to know what shopping around could save me – and whether
  spending more would be better for my eyes. The eye test A basic eye test
  typically costs between £20 and £30, and it is recommended that you have one
  every two years. An enhanced eye test is also available at most opticians.
  These allow an optometrist to view the health of the eye in more detail. Costs
  can really vary. Specsavers says an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan –
  which takes a 3D image of the back of the eye – may cost up to £10 extra,
  whereas some Boots outlets charge an extra £60 for an OCT scan and an
  “optomap” eye scan. Manveer Seyan, a senior lecturer in optometry at the
  University of Hertfordshire, says a basic eye test is adequate in most cases,
  but enhanced examinations can help to detect the earliest signs of eye
  disease, often before symptoms appear. “The scans are also very useful in
  monitoring the progression of any retinal conditions,” he says. “If an
  optometrist recommends an enhanced eye examination, it would be advisable to
  have one.” Some people can get free eye tests through the NHS if they are
  eligible: for example, if they are receiving certain benefits. Anyone using a
  screen for their work should also be entitled to a free eye test through their
  employer, while some companies may contribute to the price of glasses if you
  are required to wear them for your job. What makes up the price of a pair of
  glasses? When you buy a pair of glasses, you are paying for two elements: the
  frame and the lenses. Frames: The cost will depend on the materials involved
  and the design, with the cheapest starting at less than £10, and some top-end
  designer frames priced at £500 or more. More expensive frames tend to be made
  from lightweight materials such as stainless steel, while cheaper frames are
  often made with heavier and less durable materials such as plastic. Lenses:
  Often the lenses will be the biggest part of the cost – particularly if you
  need a strong prescription. Basic single-vision lenses are the cheapest, and
  those with more complicated elements, such as bifocal and varifocal lenses,
  are more expensive because they include multiple prescriptions. Varifocal
  glasses are available at a variety of prices depending on the design: this
  refers to how the lens is engineered to accommodate the different
  prescriptions the wearer needs. Occupational lenses, also known as office
  lenses, for example, are one variety of varifocals designed for indoor use.
  They are recommended for anyone who needs clear vision for near and
  mid-distance. Upgrading from basic lenses will add to the cost. Here are some
  examples of upgrades you can add (all the costs quoted here are provided by
  Specsavers). High-index lenses: these are lighter than standard lenses and
  suited to people with higher prescriptions who would otherwise have a heavy
  pair of glasses to wear. Generally, the thinner and lighter the lens is, the
  more expensive it will be. Extra-thin lenses can add £60 to the cost, for
  example. Sun tint and UV: this is a permanent tint to your glasses, in a
  choice of colours, which can relieve eye strain and soften harsh lighting, and
  includes UV protection. This is usually about £30 more. Hard coating: most
  glasses already come with a hard coating on the lens to protect against
  scratches, but you can often choose an enhanced scratch-resistant and
  anti-reflection coating to reduce reflections. It can cost about £35.
  Photochromic lenses: also known as transition lenses, these are clear when you
  are indoors and go darker when you are in the sun. These typically cosr an
  extra £85. Mirror lenses: enhanced lenses for sunglasses that reflect light
  and reduce glare. From £60. Polarised tints: you can choose this option for
  sunglasses and it can help reduce glare. From £70. You can buy cheap reading
  glasses on the high street. While they can be useful as a spare set, Seyan
  warns they have limitations. “The ‘one size fits all’ nature can mean that the
  frame doesn’t fit correctly and the wearer doesn’t look through the centre of
  the lens,” he says. “Ready-made glasses also have the same power lens in both
  eyes, and unless the wearer has exactly the same prescription, they will not
  be perfect.” Online savings While traditional shops such as Specsavers, Vision
  Express or Boots Opticians provide a face-to-face service, there are also lots
  of online options for buying frames and lenses once you have your
  prescription. For anyone with a simple prescription, prices for both frames
  and lenses are usually lower online. Research done in 2023 by Glasses Direct,
  one of the biggest online retailers, claimed its customers spent an average of
  £109.60 compared with the £212.90 they spent, on average, the last time they
  bought similar glasses from a high street optician. Buying online has other
  benefits, too – you can browse whenever you want to, and comparing costs
  between retailers is quicker. Online retailers say they provide the same
  advice as a physical branch, either on the phone or through email, and most
  have the technology to allow you to try on glasses virtually. Neil Perry, the
  operations manager at online retailer Lensology, says prices are often up to
  70% cheaper online. He suggests that in physical shops customers can feel
  obliged to make quick decisions about frames, lens finishes and other add-ons,
  which can lead to them spending more on extras that may not “have been fully
  considered”. However, you cannot buy all frames online – varifocals and
  bifocals are only available in branches at Specsavers, for example, and you
  will miss out on expert help to make sure the glasses fit. You may also have
  to factor in delivery costs that may not be included in the headline price.
  Seyan says he would advise buying glasses from a physical optician because
  “choosing a suitable frame involves finding something that not only looks good
  but is the right size and, most importantly, is suitable for the prescription
  issued. Dispensing opticians or appropriately trained staff in a practice can
  make suitable recommendations, and this kind of advice isn’t always available
  online.” Specific measurements need to be taken to ensure the lenses align
  with the wearer’s pupil, and extra measurements are required for more complex
  lenses such as bifocals. “Not taking accurate measurements and having
  misaligned optical centres can affect a wearer’s vision and give rise to
  secondary issues such as eye strain and headaches. When ordering spectacles
  online, these measurements are often estimated and this can cause problems
  later,” Seyan says. Bear in mind that there are lots of deals and discounts at
  online and bricks and mortar outlets – such as money off if you buy two pairs.
  Whether you shop online or on the high street, it is important to go to an
  optician registered with the GOC. These businesses must meet certain standards
  and, if they breach these, they can be sanctioned. Anyone can search the
  public register to see if a business or optician is registered with the GOC.
  Help with costs You may get a free eye test or eye vouchers towards the cost
  of glasses if you are receiving any of the following benefits: income support,
  income-based employment and support allowance, income-based jobseeker’s
  allowance, pension credit guarantee credit or universal credit and you meet
  the criteria. Some of the other reasons for qualifying also include being
  under 16 or over 60, registered as partly sighted or blind, having been
  diagnosed with diabetes or glaucoma, or if you have been advised by an eye
  doctor to have a test (you can find a full list on the NHS website). Where can
  I find best value for money? We compared the costs of a very basic set of
  frames with single prescription lenses to see where prices start at different
  retailers. Remember you may be able to get a voucher towards the cost from
  your employer: • SelectSpecs (online): starts from £6, which includes single
  vision basic lenses. • Glasses Direct (online): starts from £9, which includes
  1.5 index prescription lenses. • Spex4Less (online): starts from £12.95 for
  frames only. Basic single vision lenses start from £5. • Specsavers (online
  and branches): starts from £15, which includes basic single vision lenses. •
  Vision Express (online and branches): Starts from £25, which includes basic
  single vision lenses. • Boots Opticians (online and branches): starts from
  £50, which includes basic single vision lenses. • Lensology (online): Starts
  from £16 for single vision lenses only (aimed at those upgrading an existing
  pair of glasses).
