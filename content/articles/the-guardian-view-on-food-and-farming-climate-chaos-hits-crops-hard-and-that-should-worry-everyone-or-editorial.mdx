  British farmers are, of course, not the only people who are suffering from the
  effects of this summer’s heatwaves. Across Europe and the Middle East,
  record-breaking temperatures are threatening lives as well as livelihoods.
  France has experienced its largest wildfire since 1949, while across Europe an
  estimated 500,000 hectares of land have burned. But farmers are particularly
  vulnerable to extreme weather, which has a direct impact on crop yields. So
  reports of a second consecutive year in which food growers in parts of the UK
  are seeing dramatic falls in production should concern the British public.
  Access to food is frequently taken for granted in the world’s wealthiest
  nations. But increased food insecurity is among the dangerous effects of the
  climate crisis, as well as being worsened by Trump’s tariffs, and geopolitical
  instability including the war in Ukraine. Last year the problem for British
  farmers was too much summer rain, leading to waterlogged fields and lost
  crops. This year the challenge has been the reverse: prolonged, intense hot
  weather, leading to large parts of England being declared officially in
  drought. Dramatic local and regional variations complicate the picture. While
  some farmers are warning of smaller vegetables in supermarkets following
  disappointing early harvests, others have fared quite well. It is too soon to
  draw firm conclusions or make decisive comparisons with previous years. What
  is already beyond doubt, however, is the immense challenge of adapting to an
  altered reality. At a recent water summit hosted by the National Farmers’
  Union, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, suggested that the government
  might support a change to planning rules, making it easier for farmers to
  build reservoirs on their land. Ministers should work with nature experts as
  well as farmers to develop this, and other proposals to boost resilience, in
  an environmentally responsible way. While tensions between the priorities of
  conservationists and farmers have not gone away, there is also common ground,
  for example around the need for stronger, long-term water infrastructure and
  flood risk planning. Last month a survey by the Energy and Climate
  Intelligence Unit found that more than 80% of UK farmers are worried about the
  climate crisis. Such fears, along with falls in crop yields and incomes, also
  help explain the furious reaction to inheritance tax changes introduced last
  year by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, restricting an exemption for
  agricultural land. Last week the independent Centre for the Analysis of
  Taxation proposed amendments to the new rules that the Treasury should
  consider carefully. The chancellor is right to target wealthy, tax-avoiding
  landowners. But ministerial antagonism toward rural communities serves no
  purpose and only plays into the populist right’s hands. While farmers are the
  first to register falling yields, and smaller heads of broccoli, the
  productivity and resilience of agricultural land affects everyone who is not
  insulated by wealth from higher food prices. Last month a thinktank, the
  Autonomy Institute, argued that the UK is particularly exposed to
  “climateflation” due to its heavy reliance on food imports. Extreme weather
  could drive up food prices by more than a third by 2050. With this in mind,
  the government should seek constructive engagement with farmers, while
  promoting healthy food policies. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised
