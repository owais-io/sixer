  Metals recyclers are at loggerheads with the British steel industry over a
  call to limit lucrative scrap exports so steel can be reused by UK furnaces.
  The British Metals Recycling Association (BMRA) claims a ban on scrap steel
  exports to less wealthy countries could cost £5bn in lost economic activity
  and as many as 20,000 jobs. Steelmakers in the UK are keen to retain the metal
  to melt down into new steel. The bulk of the 5.6m tonnes of steel made in the
  UK in 2023 was made in Port Talbot and Scunthorpe, in carbon-heavy blast
  furnaces that rely on iron ore dug from the ground. However, both sites are
  expected to upgrade to much cleaner electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which use
  greener technology to melt scrap and produce steel. Currently, four-fifths of
  the UK’s scrap steel – from old cars, buildings and bridges – is exported via
  scrap yards and is often melted down in EAFs overseas. However, UK Steel, a
  lobby group, has called for the government to limit this trade as it expects
  demand for scrap will surge by 70% as early as 2027 as Port Talbot, owned by
  Indian conglomerate Tata Steel, switches on its new EAF. The group forecasts
  demand will then triple by 2050 compared with 2023 levels. UK Steel has asked
  ministers for limits on exports to countries outside the Organisation of
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Members of this bloc of wealthier
  countries can “demonstrate their ability to treat waste sustainably”, it says.
  However, at the moment four of the top five destinations for UK scrap metal
  are non-OECD countries, according to the BMRA. In practice, many poorer
  economies would be unlikely to be able to prove environmental credentials. An
  analysis for the BMRA by academics at Sheffield Hallam University said such
  limits could cause gross value added (GVA) from the recycling to halve. James
  Kelly, the BMRA’s chief executive, said limiting exports “wouldn’t just cut
  tonnage – it would erode the fundamental economics that sustain the sector in
  a globally competitive environment”. “Exports are the lifeblood of the UK
  metals recycling industry and global demand for recycled steel is set to rise
  dramatically,” he said. “Curtailing exports would be shortsighted and could
  see the UK miss out on significant growth for an already large industry that
  currently directly employs over 15,000 people and delivers £9bn GVA per
  annum.” Prof Will Eadson, a professor of urban and regional studies at
  Sheffield Hallam University, said: “Careful thought must be given to any
  measures which seek to restrict overseas trade – we can see clearly how quotas
  and bans may lower exports, but at a cost to the overall value of the sector.”
  A UK Steel spokesperson said its proposals would “secure the higher quality
  and greater volumes of steel scrap needed for the UK’s journey to net zero
  steelmaking”. “At no point have we called for a ban on steel scrap exports,”
  they said. “Free and fair trade is a cornerstone of the UK steel industry.
  What is needed is a proportionate system of environmental regulation to ensure
  that wherever UK scrap is exported, it is processed to the same high standards
  we uphold here.”
