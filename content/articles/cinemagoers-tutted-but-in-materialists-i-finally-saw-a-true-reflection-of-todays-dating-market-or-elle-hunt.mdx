  On Sunday I took myself, with a slight hangover, to see a preview screening of
  Materialists, the long-awaited new film by Celine Song. Dakota Johnson plays
  Lucy, a matchmaker with a talent for pairing her exacting clients with someone
  who ticks most of their boxes and is also likely to accept them. She is less
  cupid, more market analyst – capable of seeing through her singletons’
  self-serving bluster and spin to appraise their actual worth – then matching
  it with someone of equivalent value. A thirtysomething woman of only average
  good looks, for instance, can’t hope to land a “unicorn” – a 6ft-tall high
  earner with his original hairline. Unicorns want to date twentysomethings –
  and they can get them, too. Lucy herself is jaded as a result of her job, and
  pragmatic, having grown up poor. Her last serious relationship – with John
  (Chris Evans), an aspiring theatre actor/cater waiter – ended after he
  admitted, just before their anniversary dinner, that he didn’t have $25 to pay
  for parking. Now Lucy is resolved to stay single or marry rich – preferably
  eye-poppingly rich. When she is wooed by Harry (Pedro Pascal) – one of those
  unicorns her clients seek – and returns home with him to his
  multimillion-dollar apartment, her head swivels round mid-embrace, totting up
  its approximate worth. Obviously one matinee screening in Norwich doesn’t
  count for much in terms of market research, but I got the impression – from
  the audible and repeated tuts, tsks and groans around me – that the (mostly
  older) audience was dismayed by these explicit conflations of romance with
  finance. I kept quiet in my seat, uncomfortably conscious that I was finally
  watching a romcom that showed a version of dating and romance I recognised.
  That it’s Tough Out There for single people is a truth pretty much universally
  acknowledged, and widely blamed on dating apps. The technology – mainstream
  now for more than a decade – has become inextricable from the experience of
  dating; even if you don’t use dating apps yourself, you can feel their
  influence in the normalisation of ghosting, for instance, or “situationships”
  of convenience. Materialists, written and directed by Song, was inspired by
  her own brief experience working as a matchmaker in New York. But Lucy’s
  clients, with their checklists, seem to be an embodiment of the apps’
  consumerist logic. Your profile is essentially a billboard on which you
  display your most marketable self and specify the traits you seek (and won’t
  accept) in others. Swiping is an instant, binary value judgment, appraising
  someone as being worthy (or not) of your attention. Your choices seem
  infinite. Meanwhile, access to the most in-demand – and therefore the most
  desirable, per the algorithm – matches is increasingly reserved for paying
  members. It is at best a crude way of creating connection, and at worst
  explicitly capitalistic in a way that is at odds with attraction, commitment
  and intimacy. Now, as described by the sociologist Eva Illouz (notably in The
  End of Love), that hyper-rational, self-serving approach has escaped online
  dating to infiltrate all of modern love. Years of swiping have primed people
  to expect to feel the same instant feedback that someone is right for them,
  before they commit to finding out. A relationship, meanwhile – a costly
  endeavour in a culture that prizes individualism, freedom and choice – must
  offer a return on investment. You might not express this as baldly as Lucy or
  her clients, but it is in the air, the unspoken calculation behind many of our
  romantic decisions (and even our platonic ones: consider the brittle
  discussion of “friendship breakups” and “toxic friends”). Illouz terms it
  “emotional capitalism”, whereby “emotional life – especially that of the
  middle classes – follows the logic of economic relations and exchange”. What
  has really given teeth to this clinical number-crunching is wealth inequality,
  foregrounding the financial support of a partner – and incentivising some to
  find the richest one possible. The comparisons with the marriage market of
  Jane Austen’s time aren’t just qualitative, but backed by data. Stagnating
  salaries and rising costs mean that if you don’t come from wealth yourself,
  the only way to improve your material circumstances – or just achieve
  financial security – is through a relationship. A recent survey by the
  financial services provider OneFamily found that one in five young adults aged
  between 18 and 40 are choosing to live with a partner primarily to make living
  costs more affordable, “because the bills are too high to contemplate managing
  on their own”, as the OneFamily CEO put it. Even if you are in a happy,
  reciprocal relationship, you can’t block out this influence altogether: do you
  love your partner, or do you love paying 50% less rent? Though I am largely
  contentedly single, I’m uncomfortably conscious that as a self-employed person
  in a struggling industry, my best shot at improving my circumstances, or even
  changing my life, is finding a partner. This doesn’t influence my decisions in
  dating – but I can’t say that I don’t fleetingly think, when I meet a nice
  doctor who owns a three-bedroom house in south London, that it would be
  especially nice if it worked out. (It didn’t!) It is naive to believe that we
  can separate romance and even relationships from financial reality. Against
  such a brutal backdrop, financial stability is arguably a sound reason to
  prioritise the search for love. If that strikes us as unsavoury or regressive,
  we should push for affordable housing and more financial and society safety
  nets, so that we can enter into relationships freely and set love apart, as
  best we can, from finances. For now, the challenge faced by modern singles –
  as Materialists acknowledges – is striking a balance between pragmatism and
  idealism, and holding on to hope against, often brutal reality checks. “Some
  people just want more” is the film’s tagline. I can’t begrudge anyone for
  dating for money more than for love, when the two are so entangled. But we
  might ultimately be better off pushing for more from society, rather than our
  partners. Elle Hunt is a freelance journalist Do you have an opinion on the
