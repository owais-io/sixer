  A group of global civil society organizations have placed the US on a
  watchlist for urgent concern over the health of its civic society, alongside
  Turkey, Serbia, El Salvador, Indonesia and Kenya. On Wednesday, a new report
  released by the non-profit Civicus placed the US on its watchlist following
  “sustained attacks on civic freedoms” across the country, according to the
  group. Civicus pointed to three major issues including the deployment of
  military to quell protests, growing restrictions placed on journalists and
  civil society, as well as the aggressive targeting of anti-war advocates
  surrounding Palestine. At Civicus, countries are assigned a rating over their
  civic space conditions. The ratings include “open”, “narrowed”, “obstructed”,
  “repressed” and “closed”. The group has declared the US’s civic space as
  “narrowed”. According to the group, the “narrowed” rating is for countries
  that still allow individuals and civil society organizations to exercise their
  rights to freedom of association, peaceful assembly and expression but where
  violations of these rights still take place. “People can form associations to
  pursue a wide range of interests, but full enjoyment of this right is impeded
  by occasional harassment, arrest or assault of people deemed critical of those
  in power,” the rating description says, adding: “Protests are conducted
  peacefully, although authorities sometimes deny permission, citing security
  concerns, and excessive force, which may include tear gas and rubber bullets,
  are sometimes used against peaceful demonstrators.” With regard to the media,
  countries with a “narrowed” rating allow media to “disseminate a wide range of
  information, although the state undermines complete press freedom either
  through strict regulation or by exerting political pressure on media owners”.
  “The United States appears to be sliding deeper into the quicksands of
  authoritarianism. Peaceful protests are confronted with military force,
  critics are treated as criminals, journalists are targeted, and support for
  civil society and international cooperation have been cut back,” Mandeep
  Tiwana, Civicus’s secretary general, said in a statement. “Six months into
  Donald Trump’s second term, a bizarre assault on fundamental freedoms and
  constitutional safeguards has become the new normal,” he added. Pointing to
  Trump’s deployment of marines and national guard troops to California in June
  in response to the widespread protests against immigration raids, Tiwana said:
  “This level of militarisation sets a dangerous precedent. It’s a line that
  democratically elected leaders aren’t meant to cross.” Tiwana also pointed to
  the Trump administration’s latest attacks against media networks, including
  funding restrictions on public broadcast stations including PBS and NPR. “What
  they’re trying to do is actually defund critical news sources and deny
  American people the ability to receive truthful non-partisan reporting by
  pulling their funding,” Tiwana told the Guardian. In its report, Civicus also
  warned of the growing criminalisation of peaceful advocacy, adding that
  “authorities have continued reprisals against activists expressing solidarity
  with Palestinian rights.” Citing the Trump administration’s clampdown on
  foreign-born student activists including Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi and
  Rümeysa Öztürk, as well as the sanctioning of Francesca Albanese, the UN
  special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, Tiwana said: “We are seeing a
  wide-ranging attack on civic space in the US by the federal and some state
  governments. Authorities in the US should reverse course from the present
  undemocratic path by guaranteeing everyone’s first amendment right to organise
  and dissent legitimately.”
