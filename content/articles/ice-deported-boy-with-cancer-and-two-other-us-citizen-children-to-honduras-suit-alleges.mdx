  A lawsuit filed in Louisiana on behalf of two mothers and their four minor
  children, including one with cancer, claims the two families were unlawfully
  denied due process and deported by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (Ice) to Honduras in April 2025. The lawsuit, which names the attorney
  general, Pam Bondi, Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem,
  and various Ice officials as defendants, alleges Ice violated its own
  policies, and multiple federal laws, when officers secretly detained the
  families, denied access to counsel and swiftly deported them to Honduras,
  ignoring legal filings. The claim, JLV v Acuna, filed by the National
  Immigration Project, says that three of the children – a four-year-old boy
  with stage 4 kidney cancer, his seven-year-old sister and a two-year-old girl
  – were included in the deportation sweep despite being American citizens. The
  parents “were never given a choice as to whether their children should be
  deported with them and were prohibited from contacting their counsel or having
  meaningful contact with their families to arrange for the care of their
  children”, the lawsuit claims. The mothers, pseudonymously named as Rosario
  and Julia, allege they wanted their children to remain in the US but the
  families were “illegally deported without even a semblance of due process”.
  One of the children, named as five-year-old Romeo, was diagnosed with a “rare
  and aggressive form of kidney cancer” at age two and had been receiving
  treatment in the US. “The failure to allow his mother to arrange for his care,
  in violation of Ice’s own directive, and his unlawful deportation to Honduras
  interfered with his needed medical treatment,” the suit, filed in the US
  district court for the middle district of Louisiana on 31 July, states. Sirine
  Shebaya, executive director of the National Immigration Project, said in a
  statement that “Ice’s actions in this case are not only unlawful, they are
  cruel and show a complete disregard for family values and the wellbeing of
  children”. “No government agency should have the power to disappear families,
  ignore medical needs, and disregard its own policies and constitutional rights
  simply in order to achieve a goal of unfettered enforcement,” Shebaya added.
  The Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said
  in a statement to NBC News that US children were not being “deported” and
  denied that the parents were not given a choice regarding the care of their
  children before being sent to Honduras. “Rather than separate their families,
  ICE asked the mothers if they wanted to be removed with their children or if
  they wanted ICE to place the children with someone safe the parent designates.
  The parents in this instance made the determination to take their children
  with them back to Honduras,” McLaughlin said. McLaughlin added that when there
  is a health issue, “ICE makes sure that treatment is available in the country
  to which the illegal alien is being removed. The implication that ICE would
  deny a child the medical care they need is flatly FALSE, and it is an insult
  to the men and women of federal law enforcement.” The lawsuit comes amid
  claims and counterclaims about the number of people being swept up in the
  administration’s immigration enforcement efforts, and the legality of those
  efforts under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. There have been more than 1,000
  deportation flights to 62 countries since Donald Trump was sworn into office
  in January, according to the immigrant advocacy group Witness at the Border.
  But that number of flights is becoming more difficult to track, the group
  warns, after air charter companies began requesting that their tail numbers be
  removed from public flight-tracking websites. Rosario, one of the mothers
  named in the lawsuit, told the legal group that the deportation experience had
  been “scary and overwhelming”. “After so many years in the United States, it
  has been devastating to be sent to Honduras,” she said. “Life in Honduras is
  incredibly hard. I don’t have the resources to care for my children the way
  they need.” The other, Julia, said: “This whole situation has been incredibly
  stressful.” She had arrived in the US in 2019 after fleeing Honduras and
  applied for asylum, but was forced to wait in Mexico under Trump’s first-term
  “remain in Mexico” policy. She returned to the US in 2021. The lawsuit states
  that she was told to check in with Ice, bringing both of her daughters to her
  regular Ice check-ins in February 2021. But in April she went to an
  appointment and was soon told she would be deported along with her children.
  “I was lied to,” she said. “I never imagined they would send me and my
  children to Honduras. Returning to Honduras has meant leaving my husband
  behind, and that’s been very hard. My daughters have also suffered a lot. We
  were deprived of the opportunity to be and make decisions as a family.” Her
  attorney claims that an Ice officer told her to write on a piece of paper that
  her daughter would be going with her to Honduras. When she objected, an Ice
  officer allegedly told her that if she refused, her daughter would be sent to
  a foster home. The Department of Homeland Security said in its statement to
  NBC News that it “takes its responsibility to protect children seriously and
  will continue to work with federal law enforcement to ensure that children are
  safe and protected”. In a statement, Erin Hebert of Ware Immigration said Ice
  officials had “betrayed their most basic duty: to safeguard the wellbeing of
  US citizens. These children and their families deserve justice and
  accountability for the flagrant and unapologetic violations of their rights.”
