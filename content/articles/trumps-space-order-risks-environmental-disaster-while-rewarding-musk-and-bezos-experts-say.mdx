  A draft executive order from Donald Trump that aims to largely exempt space
  launches from environmental review is viewed as a gift to commercial space
  industry players such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and others who have long
  targeted the regulations. But its central components may be illegal and the US
  president “is trying to do an end run around” the law, said Jared Margolis, an
  attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, which has litigated
  environmental issues around launches. If successfully implemented, the
  launches could create an environmental disaster, advocates say. Rocket
  launches create a huge amount of pollution that can contaminate local
  waterways and air with high levels of mercury, Pfas, particulate matter and
  other highly toxic substances. The vibration, sound waves, heat and explosions
  damage habitat and kill wildlife, some of which are protected by the
  Endangered Species Act. The executive order directs the US transportation
  department to “use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite”
  environmental reviews. Among the few protections during space launches is the
  National Environmental Policy Act (Nepa) review that considers a wide range of
  impacts on the environment and human health, and the Coastal Zone Management
  Act, a federal law that allows states to decide how coastlines are used. The
  order targets both, and suggests the agency could attempt to circumvent the
  Endangered Species Act. “The order is directing the transportation department
  to do whatever they can to avoid Nepa, but it doesn’t mean that’s possible, or
  that they have the authority to do so,” Margolis said. The executive order
  comes at a time when commercial space activity is spiking. Musk’s SpaceX, the
  largest space company, did 96 launches in 2023, and is targeting 180 this
  year. That number is expected to continue growing, while other players, like
  Bezos’s Blue Horizon, are quickly increasing launch rates. The US federal
  government’s environmental oversight of the launches has always been weak,
  public health advocates say. The Trump administration quickly hobbled several
  of the few regulatory mechanisms that existed, and recently gutted funding for
  research into stratospheric pollution largely caused by Musk’s SpaceX. “We’re
  accelerating the number of launches and blinding ourselves to the follow-up
  effects that they have on the environment – that spells disaster,” said a
  space industry employee who does work around Nepa issues, but requested
  anonymity to talk about the order without retribution. Space companies must
  obtain a launch permit from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which
  does a Nepa review as part of the process. The reviews are the framework by
  which federal agencies should assess a project’s environmental or human health
  risks. They take into consideration air pollution, endangered species harms,
  water pollution, wildfire risk, noise pollution and potential human health
  risks, among other issues. The FAA has faced criticism from space companies
  for taking too long to review launch permits – about five months – while
  environmental groups have lambasted the agency for not using Nepa reviews to
  require more protections at launch sites. The executive order in part directs
  the department to classify the launches as “categorical exclusions”, which is
  the legal term for minor changes to a site that do not require a Nepa
  environmental review. Among other categorical exclusions are landscaping or
  lighting alterations. Legal experts who reviewed the order questioned the
  legality of the claim that a rocket launch has similar environmental impacts
  to landscaping changes. The plan “fits with their overall desire to eliminate
  environmental considerations and reviews”, said Dan Farber, an environmental
  law attorney with the University of California, Berkeley. “Clearly what Trump
  wants to do is bulldoze through all this procedural stuff,” Farber added.
  However, there is a more legally plausible route. The Commercial Space Launch
  Act does include a provision that allows the transportation secretary to
  attempt to exempt requirements of environmental law if it is determined that
  the law is not necessary to protect the “public health and the safety of
  property”, Margolis said. That would be accomplished through a legal
  rulemaking process. But the provision is in conflict with Nepa, which applies
  to any federal action that has significant environmental impact, Margolis
  said. “We would argue that review is necessary to protect public health and
  safety, and Nepa applies,” he added. The Nepa reviews provide a valuable legal
  avenue for challenges to the worst abuses, and Margolis said the order seems
  to be a response to arguments he made in which the Center for Biological
  Diversity sued several federal agencies and SpaceX over launches from the Boca
  Chica, Texas launch site on the Gulf of Mexico. The site sits next to a
  sensitive habitat for protected species, like the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle,
  which is on the brink of extinction. SpaceX has launched the largest rockets
  ever made from the site, and several of those exploded, raining down
  particulate matter, metal and concrete across the region. The debris caused
  brush fires and covered homes six miles away in dust. Sound waves from
  launches have been known to kill birds and other animals, and SpaceX has been
  cited by state environmental regulators in Texas for spitting wastewater
  highly contaminated with mercury into adjacent waters. Still, the FAA has done
  little to mitigate the damage to the environment, and claimed the issues did
  not warrant an in-depth review. Margolis said SpaceX, with the FAA’s blessing,
  had turned the ecologically sensitive area into a “sacrifice zone”, and the
  litigation is ongoing. The order also seems designed to aid Musk in his fight
  with California state regulators who have so far stopped SpaceX from expanding
  the number of launches along the coastline, in part using their authority
  under the Coastal Zone Management Act. Trump’s order would give federal
  authorities more power to intervene, and restrict state agencies’
  decision-making powers. Margolis said this part of the order was also illegal
  because Trump was again attempting to change the law by decree. “It’s a
  talking point to show he’s supporting industry, but at the end of the day it’s
  not something that can happen the way he says it can happen,” Margolis said.
