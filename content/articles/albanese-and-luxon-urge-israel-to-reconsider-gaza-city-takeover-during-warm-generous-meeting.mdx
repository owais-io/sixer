  Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and his New Zealand counterpart,
  Christopher Luxon, have urged Israel to reconsider its plans to take over Gaza
  City and reaffirmed their intentions to deepen security ties, as they met in
  Queenstown on Saturday. Following a pōwhiri (formal Māori welcome) at Te
  Wharehuanui – a private retreat built by the billionaire Xero founder, Rod
  Drury – Luxon said the world had become uncertain and fractious, and that New
  Zealand “has no greater friend than Australia”. “The two of us being able to
  come together to advocate for our values and stand up in the world and go out
  into the world together is really important,” he said. Sign up: AU Breaking
  News email Albanese thanked Luxon and the local iwi (tribe) Ngāi Tahu for the
  “warm, generous” welcome and similarly pointed to the importance of the
  trans-Tasman alliance and being part of the “Pacific family” amid global
  upheaval. “There is one thing that is certain … Australia and New Zealand
  stand together.” The welcome concluded with a boisterous hug between the two
  leaders. It is the pair’s second annual meeting, following Luxon’s visit to
  Canberra last year. Gaza and the topic of recognising Palestinian statehood
  loomed large, two days after the Israeli security cabinet approved a plan to
  take over Gaza City, prompting global condemnation. On Saturday, the foreign
  ministers of both countries alongside Germany, Italy and UK released a joint
  statement condemning Israel’s latest offensive. Last month, New Zealand and
  Australia cosigned the New York Call – a declaration indicating the possible
  recognition of Palestinian statehood. Speaking to media after their formal
  meeting, neither Luxon nor Albanese would confirm when a declaration of
  statehood might happen but said Israel’s latest plans were “wrong”. “Military
  action, as we’ve seen, is not the way to solve this problem,” Luxon said. “The
  latest action from Israel we’re seeing in the past 24 hours is wrong and risks
  violating international law.” Australians want to see a ceasefire, Albanese
  said. “They want to see the killing stop. They want to see hostages released.
  They want to see peace in the region.” Both leaders rejected the idea that
  possible trade retaliation from the US president, Donald Trump, over
  recognising Palestinian statehood would affect their positions. Australian
  goods imported into the US have attracted Trump’s baseline 10% tariff, while
  last week, New Zealand was hit with a surprise 15% tariff. “We make our own
  assessments in … our own economic and our security interests,” Luxon said.
  “Australia has exactly the same position,” Albanese said. “As a sovereign
  nation, we make our decisions.” The leaders also discussed deepening ties in
  defence and security, and fielded questions about their nations’ relationships
  with China, which is the largest trading partner to both countries but whose
  growing influence and military exercises in the Pacific have caused
  discomfort. The leaders told the media they had each made successful visits to
  China recently. “We cooperate where we can and disagree where we must,”
  Albanese said. Trade and economic growth was high on the agenda, with each
  committing to coordinate closely on economic reform. But while the leaders
  stressed their strong friendship, the countries are not without tensions, the
  thorniest of which arose in Saturday’s talks. The deportations of New
  Zealanders – despite in some cases tenuous connections to New Zealand – has
  provoked long-running frustration in the relationship. After Albanese
  delivered an olive branch to New Zealand in 2023, announcing that the
  immigration department would have to pay greater attention to the strength,
  duration and nature of a person’s connection to the Australian community, that
  was suddenly wound back in mid 2024. Responding to questions over whether
  Australia’s U-turn was fair to New Zealand, Albanese said he had to do what
  was best for Australia, but he expected Luxon would bring up the issue. “Our
  priority is safety in Australia but also a commonsense approach,” Albanese
  said.
