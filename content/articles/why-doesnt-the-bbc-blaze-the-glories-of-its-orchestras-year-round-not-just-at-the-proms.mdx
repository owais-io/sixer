  Why doesn’t the BBC blaze the glories of its orchestras year round, not just
  at the Proms?

  This week, the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and Concert Choir will
  perform Beethoven’s Symphony No 9 at the BBC Proms. It could well prove a
  season highlight. After nearly a decade under chief conductor Fabio Luisi, the
  orchestra has never sounded better. The ensemble’s anglicised name conceals
  the fact that it’s operated and funded by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation
  (DR). Five years older than the BBC Symphony Orchestra, it celebrates its
  centenary this year – the second-oldest so-called “radio orchestra” in Europe.
  Some broadcasting executives on the continent are asking why radio orchestras
  still exist while the institutions they lead are faced with the wider question
  of public service broadcasting’s relevance in a consumer age. The BBC, on
  which DR was modelled, is all too evidently grappling with both issues. DR,
  meanwhile, has used the first question to help to address the second. It has
  put its musical ensembles at the heart of its public service mission – in so
  doing, justifying not just their existence but its own. In addition to its
  orchestra, DR runs two professional choirs (both at the Proms this week),
  several youth choirs, a conducting academy and a big band. As well as
  performing on niche radio channels, the ensembles broadcast regularly on
  television all year round. DR has the resources to bring live, bespoke,
  original music of all kinds to the widest possible audiences, and is doing so.
  The contrast with the BBC is stark. The attitude towards in-house orchestras
  from senior leadership at New Broadcasting House suggests confusion over their
  purpose. You are unlikely to catch the BBC’s ensembles broadcasting on TV
  outside the Proms – broadcasts that are seasonal, look the same and certainly,
  in the case of the Last Night, bear little resemblance to those orchestras’
  year-round, country-wide activities. Each of the BBC’s ensembles is a colossal
  resource filled with talent and opportunity. Their broadcasting potential is
  massively underexploited. Will these ensembles even survive? The corporation
  has reduced salaried positions in its three English orchestras and had
  previously announced the closure of its only professional choir the BBC
  Singers (the chamber group survived after a backlash). A decade ago, DR faced
  the same challenges as the BBC: rapidly shifting audience habits, a funding
  model designed in a bygone age and general mistrust of a bloated,
  scandal-ridden institution. In 2018, Denmark abolished the licence fee and
  introduced a media tax instead. Now DR is funded by every taxpaying Dane on
  the principle that public service broadcasting is essential in a
  commercialised world and should therefore, like healthcare, be paid for even
  by those who claim not to use it. Introducing the media tax has defused the
  debate around the fallacy of raising funds for public broadcasting on the
  basis of the equipment used to receive it. It also made a concession to those
  who believed DR had become too big, cutting its funding by 20% (a cut
  mitigated to 10% in 2019 by the newly elected Social Democrats-led
  government). In being forced to downsize, DR identified its core mission.
  According to its latest strategy, it exists to “support democracy, contribute
  to Danish culture and strengthen communities”. This has meant a bolstering of
  its cultural offering, not a reduction. The licences on entertainment shows
  such as The X Factor have been released for option by commercial rivals. Those
  decisions were vindicated when the first Covid-19 lockdowns arrived. DR put
  its musical ensembles to work on television. On Friday nights for much of
  2020, the Danish National Vocal Ensemble led live singalongs on a TV show
  called Fællesang (Communal Song). The programme proved so popular it was made
  permanent and eventually moved to the slot once occupied by The X Factor. In
  its capacity to unite a nation across generational boundaries, broadcast live
  music, freed from the trappings of stardom and commerce, had proved its worth.
  DR had fulfilled its responsibility to deliver not what it thinks we want more
  of – as social media does – but what we didn’t yet know was good for us.
  Political and public hostility towards DR – rife a decade ago – has dipped,
  while commercial rivals no longer claim the corporation is trying to have it
  both ways. The smaller DR’s decision to refocus on offerings the streaming
  services could never and would never deliver appears to have paid off. Music
  on television is a vital strand in that. When I moved to Denmark, I was
  astonished to see the Danish National Vocal Ensemble broadcast daily on
  television before the evening news: Dagens Sang (Song of the Day) presented
  short motets, hymns or folk songs, filmed like a music video. DR’s Girls’
  Choir has brought in the New Year on television since 1971. Performances by
  the Danish National Symphony Orchestra are televised on Saturday nights during
  its season, playing at the Jean Nouvel-designed concert hall that forms the
  centrepiece of DR’s headquarters. On Sunday nights the orchestra plays behind
  the teams on the TV panel show The Classical Music Quiz. It becomes the
  fictionalised Copenhagen Symphony Orchestra on the DR sitcom The Orchestra
  (available on AppleTV+). It is no exaggeration to say that DR’s
  comedy-documentary television show The Opera Trip has changed the way opera is
  talked about in Denmark. If there’s any argument for the public funding of
  radio and television, it pivots on providing content the market can’t or won’t
  provide. Seeing choppy waters ahead, DR has got wise to that. It has defined
  its space and is proving that to be unique, necessary and fundamentally
  unassailable by commercial counterparts. The BBC’s strategy for classical
  music set out in 2023 emphasised education and training. There is no apparent
  commitment to have the ensembles broadcast on television, in varied formats,
  all year round. Surely, the unique potential of these ensembles is to reach
  not hundreds via outreach but millions via mainstream broadcasting. It is the
  reason they exist. The more the BBC ignores the wider broadcasting potential
  of its musical ensembles, the easier it will be to cut them loose into an
  external funding environment where they can’t realistically survive. Perhaps
  that’s the long-term plan? But there is an alternative. In the spirit of John
  Reith’s belief that the BBC should aspire to offer all audiences the very
  best, its ensembles could form part of a dynamic, imaginative broadcast
  offering with live music and arts provision at its core, on TV as well as on
  radio, all year round. Commercial broadcasters couldn’t possibly provide the
  same quality, quantity or distinction. The BBC can. Doing so isn’t just its
  responsibility – it’s what should set the corporation apart. • Fabio Luisi
  conducts the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and Concert Choir at the BBC
  Proms on 21 August. Andrew Mellor is author of The Northern Silence: Journeys
  in Nordic Music and Culture (Yale). • This article was amended on 21 August
  2025. An earlier version said that the BBC Singers’ funding scheme had changed
  and that they were now partly funded by an external source. This has not
  happened.
