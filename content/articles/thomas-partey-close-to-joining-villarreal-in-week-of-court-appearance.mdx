  The former Arsenal midfielder Thomas Partey is poised to join Villarreal on a
  free transfer this week. Partey is due to appear at Westminster magistrates
  court on Tuesday after being charged with five counts of rape and one count of
  sexual assault last month, a few days after he left Arsenal having failed to
  agree a new deal. He has denied all the charges. Partey is understood to have
  completed his medical at Villarreal having settled on personal terms for a
  move back to Spain, where he has played for Atlético Madrid, Mallorca and
  Almería. He is believed to have agreed a one-year contract with an option to
  extend by 12 months, and the opportunity to play in the Champions League next
  season is thought to have been a motivating factor in the 32-year-old’s
  decision. Partey also had offers from Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Arsenal are due
  to host Villarreal in a friendly on Wednesday. Some supporters of the Spanish
  club have voiced opposition to his expected move, with a hashtag
  #NoAThomasPartey (No to Thomas Partey) trending on X and others being
  encouraged to write to Villarreal to express disappointment. Partey had been
  the subject of an investigation that began in February 2022, with the
  allegations relating to three women who reported incidents between 2021 and
  2022. Partey’s lawyer has said her client “welcomes the opportunity to finally
  clear his name”. Partey continued to play for Arsenal after first being
  arrested on suspicion of rape in July 2022 and held talks about extending his
  contract after Mikel Arteta said he was keen for him to stay. Arsenal’s
  manager said last month he was “100%” sure Arsenal followed the correct
  protocols over Partey.
