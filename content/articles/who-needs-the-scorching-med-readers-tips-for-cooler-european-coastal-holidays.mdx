  White sand, dark past on the German Baltic Spend some time on Rügen, Germany’s
  largest island, on its Baltic coast. White sandy beaches and darker history
  await. Visit Lauterbach, by the sea. From there, catch the coastal ferry to
  the tiny fishing village of Baabe, a near three-mile (5km) walk/cycle through
  rolling countryside and catch the “Raging Roland” steam train back again. Not
  far away, you can walk the cliffs that inspired Caspar David Friedrich. For a
  very different day, visit Prora and its massive beachside concrete apartment
  blocks, originally planned as a Nazi holiday complex, before becoming a Soviet
  army barracks, and now a part ruin, part reunification commercial and
  residential redevelopment. Richard Deserted beaches on the Danish Riviera Who
  needs the scorching Med when you have the Danish Riviera. The water is clean
  and refreshing. No wetsuits allowed – you’ll be laughed off the beach. Danish
  summer hols are in July so you’ll have the beach to yourself in August. Book a
  summer cottage near Gilleleje, a charming fishing village about an hour from
  Copenhagen. Denmark is expensive, so self-catering is best. Ice-cream at
  Hansens. Lunch in Gilleleje harbour. Culture at Louisiana modern art museum
  and Hamlet’s Castle in Helsingør. And day trips to Copenhagen. Christina To
  Hel and back in Poland Hel is a tiny spit of land north of Gdańsk. Guys
  selling hot smoked fish meet you as you get off the ferry. Getting there is an
  adventure in itself, as the ferry takes you past the colossal cranes of
  Gdańsk’s shipyards. Long sandy beaches, pine forests and a small picturesque
  village make Hel a fantastic place to spend a few days. Famous for its seals,
  as well as its seaside, it really is the opposite of its fiery namesake. Lucy
  Moore Swimming and seafood in Sweden We’ve just returned from a Scandi road
  trip and had four fantastic, chilled nights on Björkö. It’s only 30 minutes
  from central Gothenburg by (free!) car ferry and regular buses. Great swimming
  and beaches; micro breweries and fresh fish; sunsets and sunrises to die for;
  days out in Gothenburg, including the excellent Liseberg theme park, with no
  queues for proper scary rides – highly recommended. James Rowing in Finland’s
  Åland archipelago Fuelled by our kids’ love of flags and a craving for quiet,
  we chose Åland, thousands of islands scattered between Sweden and Finland like
  granite gods wept there. We cycled between clouds and old boat sheds, stopping
  for smoked herring and cardamom pancakes with stewed prunes (sexier than it
  sounds). By the time Ivar lent us ancient alder oars to row to the next
  island, knowing they’d be returned by a friend, we’d learned that Åland
  doesn’t welcome visitors – it absorbs them. Eliza Ainley Cliff-edge drama in
  north-west Spain Based in Oviedo (the ideal compact city), in Asturias, we
  would explore the coast one day, mountains the next, finding unexpected Gaudí
  buildings, gingerbread houses in Ribadesella, amazing cemeteries on cliff
  edges, enjoyable easy driving on perfect roads, gorgeous unspoilt beaches and
  great weather! Few tourists, thousands of Camino pilgrims along the way and
  (very weak) cider! Cannot wait to return and yes, we’d love to live there.
  Annie Hargreaves An idyllic island off Brittany, France Camping Panorama du
  Rohou, near Paimpol in northern Brittany, has excellent views over to the
  beautiful Île de Bréhat. Walk down through the forest behind the campsite to
  take a short ferry ride to the island. Hire a bike or walk to explore its
  rocky coves and quaint villages. A lighthouse at the far end of the island has
  great views and is a good spot for a picnic, or to have a Breton galette or
  crepe at nearby Paradise Rose. Les Scènes de Bréhat is an annual festival with
  live music at the beginning of July; late-running ferries get you back to the
  mainland. Stella Arctic beach holiday, Norway When we booked a trip to
  northern Norway’s stunning Lofoten Islands and Andøya we didn’t expect a beach
  holiday, but blessed with August temperatures in the high 20s we spent days
  swimming in the Arctic Ocean. Bleik beach on Andøya is one of the longest in
  Norway – “bleik” means “white” or “pale” in Norwegian, and the almost empty
  white sand, coupled with refreshing blue sea and the towering cliffs behind
  the beach, made for a perfect end to a day’s hiking. Puffins abound here, and
  whale watching trips are available from Andenes, just a few miles to the
  north. Rachel Seafood and sailing in Hanko, Finland Hanko, Finland’s
  southernmost seaside gem, sits on a sandy dune that stretches out into the
  Baltic Sea. The town comes alive in early July during the celebrated Hanko
  Regatta, a sailing festival that draws about 200 yachts. To reach Hanko from
  Helsinki, take the VR train from Helsinki Central for about €15. Rent a bike
  once you arrive to explore the sandy beaches bordered by an ancient pine
  forest, historic villas and nature reserve. In the evening, enjoy fresh
  seafood with Baltic views and sit down for a pint of Lonkero. Don’t miss the
  spa scene and wild swimming! Liina Winning tip: Bike to the beach in North
  Holland Aan Noordzee campsite, on the North Holland coast, has a simple,
  tranquil feel and no entertainment facilities. With separate cycleways
  everywhere, you can explore the beautiful coastline up to Den Helder and, by
  ferry, Texel island (sandy beaches, pretty towns and robust Texel sheep). An
  unspoilt beach walkable from the campsite awaits, with dune footpaths that
  lead to restaurants built on stilts. The sunsets over the North Sea are
  stunning. Alkmaar is accessible via a regular bus service. Nicola Hull
