  When I close my eyes and think of instant noodles, I’m brought back to
  afternoon tea at my grandparents’ public housing flat. I imagine my yeye
  (grandfather) pouring the herbal pork bone broth my grandmother had made the
  previous night into the noodle-packed styrofoam cup. It was the ultimate
  comfort food. But for this taste test comfort wasn’t the end goal. Instead I
  gathered 21 brands of instant chicken noodles that could satisfy hungry office
  workers on a deadline. The criteria: it needed to be a hot lunch you could
  make with only boiling water – and it needed to be quick. I served my
  colleagues a tasting menu of instant noodles at their desks. I only included
  cup noodles that were chicken flavoured (sorry, Indomie Mi Goreng, you will
  always have a place in my heart) and tasters were asked to rank the noodles
  based on aroma, texture and flavour. Instant noodles are really a blank
  canvas. It’s what you add to them that makes them a meal – some eggs, maybe
  kimchi or fresh veg, even actual shredded chicken. My tasters had none of
  these add-ons, though some of the packets came with dehydrated herbs and
  vegetables. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop
  culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Overall, we found
  that a delicious smell didn’t equate to a delicious feed, and that mushroom is
  a divisive flavour. Nothing on this list was truly disgusting nor was anything
  a wonder for the taste buds – all the options were truly mid. Best overall
  Lian Pho Ga Vietnamese Style Instant Rice Noodles, 70g, $2.80 ($3.57 per
  100g), available at major supermarkets Score: 7.6/10 Rice noodles aren’t
  common in instant cup noodles but even at a restaurant pho is usually served
  fairly instantly so it stands to reason that it would translate well. While
  the instant pho broth was almost universally enjoyed by the testers, the rice
  noodles were sometimes too delicate, though some found them “eminently
  slurpable”. As the images on the packaging suggest, it would be immensely
  improved by the usual suspects that are served with pho: onion, herbs and
  lemon. With those additions, it could be considered “not from a cup” or “legit
  cooked”, according to our tasters. Best value Choice Chicken Flavoured Noodle
  Cup, 70g, $1 ($1.41 per 100g), available from Aldi Score: 5.5/10 “Pretty
  average run-of-the-mill noodle,” wrote one tester, summing this one up well,
  as did another comment: “Like a Justin Bieber song.” Some thought it was both
  “salty and bland”, though the sodium content was near the middle of the bunch.
  If you had only a single gold coin for lunch, this wouldn’t be a sad way to
  spend it. The rest Suimin Chicken Noodle Cup, 70g, $2.40 ($3.43 per 100g),
  available at major supermarkets Score: 7.2/10 This product was given full
  marks by a taster who described it as “finger-licking good”. He wasn’t the
  only one to describe it that way. The taste and aroma made it seem as though
  you were walking by a KFC, though a few commented they thought it smelled like
  beef. Tasters who scored this one highly said they liked its smoky aromatic
  notes. Samyang Buldak Hot Chicken Flavour Ramen Cup, 70g, $2.50 ($3.57 per
  100g), available at major supermarkets Score: 6.6/10 Famous for being spicy,
  this was a “nostril and palate burner”, according to reviewers. Overall, we
  found the spicier cups had thicker, chewier noodles, which divided our
  tasters, but they were all united in the burn left behind by the
  “fire-engine-red soup”. Nissin Chicken Noodle Cup, 73g, $2.80 ($3.43 per
  100g), available at major supermarkets Score: 6.3/10 No list about instant
  noodles is complete without Nissin. Its founder, Momofuku Ando, a Taiwanese
  Japanese businessman, invented the first modern instant noodles in 1958. So
  how does the OG stack up? Testers commented on its aroma, which comes in
  strong with wafts of umami, but they also wrote that it was “missing punch”.
  This product had probably the most extras in the packet, including corn and
  carrot but that didn’t boost its score. Kang Shi Fu Soup Noodle Mushroom
  Chicken Flavour, 104g, $1.99 ($1.91 per 100g), available at select grocers
  Score: 6/10 Mushroom is not a unifying flavour. Many found this one woody and
  earthy but whether those attributes were seen as positive really varied.
  Considering there is no chicken in this product it’s unsurprising then that
  one person said it “smells overwhelmingly like mushroom”. Yoodles Brown Rice
  Noodles Chicken Flavour, 70g, $2.30 ($3.29 per 100g), available at Woolworths
  Score: 5.7/10 “Inoffensive” is how one taster described this gluten-free and
  vegan option. It wasn’t particularly loved by anyone, though one taster said
  it was “like the ones mum used to make”. Like most rice noodles, these ones
  rehydrated quickly but, unless they were eaten just as fast, they
  disintegrated into the soup. Ve Wong Instant Noodle Chicken Sesame Flavour,
  85g, $2.49 ($2.90 per 100g), available at select grocers Score: 5.6/10 The
  smell of the sesame oil made me hungry as I was preparing this one. It was one
  of the few that didn’t include any dehydrated vegetables – not that any of our
  tasters noticed. It had a generous amount of fragrant oil and Chinese cooking
  wine, a divisive flavour among our tasters. One noted it “smells and tastes
  like genuine chicken broth”, which made some suspicious, but it was the
  texture of the noodles – too thin – that lost it marks from many of them.
  Nongshim Shin Ramyun Spicy Chicken Bowl, 114g, $3.75 ($3.29 per 100g),
  available at Woolworths and select grocers Score: 5.5/10 As spicy as it is
  divisive, Nongshim’s cup is a staple in many pantries. Our bravest tasters
  said it was “spicy but not debilitating”, noting that it tasted a bit like the
  Mexican spice mix Tajin. Another said the spice “blew my socks off”. While the
  quintessential chicken smell was there, not many could taste it. Sunrice Yum
  Asian Style Chicken Instant Noodles, 62g, $3 ($4.84 per 100g), available at
  major supermarkets Score: 4.3/10 The aroma of this cup received near universal
  approval but it fell over when it came to the eating. The noodles are
  gluten-free, vegetarian and organic, with one of the lowest sodium levels of
  the list, but their taste and texture underwhelmed our testers. The flavour
  was a pass for most, with one tester reminded “oddly of soap and celery”.
  While other rice noodles we tested rehydrated quickly in boiling water, these
  took longer and even then it was “like chewing pipe cleaners”, according to
  one tester. Products cut for brevity Urban Eats Thai Style BBQ Chicken Noodle
