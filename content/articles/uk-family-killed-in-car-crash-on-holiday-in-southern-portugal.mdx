  A UK family have been killed in a car accident while holidaying in southern
  Portugal, local authorities have confirmed. Domingos Serrano, 55, his wife,
  Maria, 51, and their 20-year-old twin sons, Afonso and Domingos, died when
  their car collided with another vehicle on Saturday on the IP2 motorway near
  Castro Verde, in the Alentejo region. Also killed in the crash was a
  19-year-old woman reported to have been the girlfriend of one of the twins,
  along with the 26-year-old driver of the other car involved. The family were
  reportedly on their way from Faro to Mourão, in Portugal’s south-east, where
  they regularly spent holidays. The victims, originally from the Mourão area,
  lived in Thetford, Norfolk. Though they were resident in the UK, it is
  understood they were not British nationals, according to Sky News. In a
  statement, the municipal council of Mourão confirmed the deaths and declared
  two days of mourning. “It is with great regret that the municipality announces
  this information, offering its condolences to the families and friends of the
  victims,” it said. “In the car there were four occupants, of Mouranese nature,
  and a young woman with affinity to the family. Residents in England, [they]
  follow from Faro to Mourão, for the usual and deserved vacation.” The council
  announced the cancellation of all municipal activities and events across the
  weekend as a mark of respect. Tributes have been paid to the family by
  non-league Thetford Town Football Club, where the twins had played for the
  under-18s team. In a post shared on social media, the club said: “Thetford
  Town Football Club would like to pass on our sincere condolences to the
  Serrano family and the local Portuguese community after the recent tragedy
  while on holiday. “Afonso and Domingo’s were both an integral part of our
  U18’s team in recent years, both brothers sadly passed away in Portugal with
  their parents and friends in a tragic car accident. The loss of this lovely
  family will leave a massive void in the local community.” “Partiram, mas nunca
  serao esquecidos,” the club said, which translates to: “They are gone, but
  they will never be forgotten.” An investigation into the cause of the crash is
  under way.
