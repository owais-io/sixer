  experts say that’s ‘wilful disinformation’

  An Adani claim that its Australian export program, whereby coal is sent
  through the Great Barrier Reef’s shipping channels, is advancing the United
  Nations’ sustainable development goals, has been denounced by leading
  scientists. Adani’s Queensland export site claims its operations “ensure
  access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, which
  is one of the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals. Australia, along with
  other UN members, adopted the goals in 2015, designed to address global
  challenges including poverty, justice, environmental degradation and climate
  change. The relevant UN goal is chiefly concerned with providing affordable
  and clean energy, which it says requires a substantial increase in renewable
  energy. Adani’s North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT) near Bowen has the
  capacity to export 50m tonnes of coal a year. In its latest sustainability
  report, NQXT says it supports the UN goal by “enabling the export of
  high-quality Australian coal to the world”. One of Australia’s leading experts
  on the development goals, Prof John Thwaites, said the word “sustainable” in
  the UN goal was key. “I would argue that to ‘support the advancement of the
  sustainable development goals’, energy and port operations need to support
  sustainable energy,” said Thwaites, the chair of the Monash Sustainable
  Development Institute. “Simply exporting coal is not achieving or supporting
  the sustainability objective of the goals.” Sign up to get climate and
  environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter He said
  there were also numerous references in the UN goals for the need to take
  action on climate change, and that “simply exporting coal which will be burned
  and produce greenhouse gas emissions overseas” is not supportive of this.
  Another leading expert on the UN agenda, Dr Cameron Allen, said the intention
  of the energy development goal was to “focus on sustainable energy and clean
  energy and I don’t think fossil fuels or coal falls into that”. “I don’t think
  anyone would agree that it’s in line with the aims of that goal,” said Allen,
  from Monash University. “Exporting coal isn’t in line with the sentiment … or
  the language of the goal, which includes the word sustainable. The
  international climate change agreements also make it clear that burning fossil
  fuels is not sustainable.” Guardian Australia has been scrutinising various
  claims made by Adani after finding that its Carmichael coal operation has paid
  zero corporate tax in more than three years of operation, and may never do so.
  The Indian conglomerate had pledged to plough billions of dollars into the
  Australian economy through taxes and royalties when it was going through the
  contested approvals process to establish an open-cut coalmine in the Galilee
  Basin. In response to questions about how its operations advance the UN
  sustainability goals, a spokesperson for Adani’s Australian mining business,
  which is branded Bravus Mining and Resources, said coal exports helped combat
  poverty. “Developing nations in the Asia Pacific region use coal from the
  Carmichael mine alongside renewables to provide reliable and affordable energy
  solutions that help reduce poverty and power growth,” the Bravus spokesperson
  said. Adani’s port facility website also says its operations align with a UN
  goal to protect terrestrial ecosystems by managing its water on-site next to
  neighbouring wetlands. Traditional owners have raised concerns over the threat
  posed by the coal operations to the nearby Caley Valley, in claims rejected by
  Adani. In 2017 and 2019, flood waters were released from the port into the
  wetland. In the 2017 incident, the Queensland government later found the water
  that turned areas of the wetlands black from coal dust had not caused a
  widespread impact. Adani’s Carmichael mine, rail and port operation is among
  the most politically divisive projects in Australia, given it has opened up
  new fossil fuel reserves in a sensitive location at a time the country has
  pledged to transition to renewables. Claire Snyder, director of watchdog group
  Climate Integrity, said the NQXT claim amounted to aggressive greenwashing.
  “Framing coal exports as a contribution to sustainable development undermines
  global climate goals, misleads the public, and uses the authority of the UN to
  legitimise ongoing harm,” Snyder said. “Given what we know about coal’s role
  in driving climate breakdown, this is wilful disinformation and meaningless
  sustainability waffle to protect the social licence of coal.”
