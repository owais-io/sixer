  The US Department of Justice has released the transcript and audio recording
  of an interview conducted by Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, with
  the convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. In a post on X, Blanche said
  the materials were being released “in the interest of transparency”, providing
  links to the transcript and to audio files. The release includes documentation
  from a two-day interview conducted on 24 and 25 July. The materials comprise
  redacted transcripts for both days, along with multiple audio recordings –
  seven separate parts plus test recordings for day one, and four parts plus
  test recordings for day two. The Department of Justice gave Maxwell limited
  immunity to allow her to talk about her criminal case, but did not promise
  anything in exchange for her testimony, according to the transcript that was
  released. “The most important part of this agreement is that this isn’t a
  cooperation agreement, meaning that by you meeting with us today, we’re really
  just meeting,” Blanche told Maxwell. He added: “I’m not promising to do
  anything.” Maxwell, 63, was Jeffrey Epstein’s longtime associate and was
  convicted on five counts, including sex trafficking of minors, and sentenced
  to 20 years in prison in 2022 for helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage
  girls. Epstein died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial
  on sex trafficking charges. Maxwell, in the released transcript, said she
  never saw Trump do anything inappropriate and she repeatedly showered Trump
  with praise. That sort of comment would have been welcomed by Trump and his
  circle who have been keen to dismiss concerns about this relationship with
  Epstein which have roiled his support base. “I actually never saw the
  president in any type of massage setting. I never witnessed the president in
  any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate
  with anybody,” Maxwell said. But she did detail the social relationship
  between Trump and Epstein, who cultivated a wide and powerful social circle
  for many years. “I don’t know how they met, and I don’t know how they became
  friends. I certainly saw them together and I remember the few times I observed
  them together, but they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendly,” she
  said. She added: “I think they were friendly like people are in social
  settings. I don’t … I don’t think they were close friends or I certainly never
  witnessed the president in any of … I don’t recall ever seeing him in his
  house, for instance,” she said. Maxwell also told Blanche she was not aware of
  any “client list” of Epstein’s. The justice department lawyers also questioned
  Maxwell extensively about Epstein’s relationship with former president Bill
  Clinton, who travelled multiple times on Epstein’s plane and – like Trump –
  has denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of wrongdoing. “President Clinton liked
  me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth or that … that
  warmth, or however you want to characterize it, with Mr Epstein,” she said of
  Clinton’s contacts with Epstein. Maxwell also said she did not remember Trump
  having been in Epstein’s 50th birthday book, which she assembled. The Wall
  Street Journal reported in July that the book’s collection of letters included
  one with Trump’s name on it. The president has repeatedly denied writing the
  note and filed a lawsuit accusing the Journal of libel. Maxwell said she saw
  some parts of the birthday book before her trial, during its discovery phase.
  “There was nothing from President Trump,” Maxwell said. She also denied
  remembering any picture of a naked woman, a detail the Journal previously
  reported. Maxwell said Epstein did not know what to do to celebrate his 50th,
  and she suggested a birthday book like “my mom did … for my dad”. She added:
  “He said: ‘I love that idea.’” After her interview with justice department
  lawyers, Maxwell was moved from the low-security federal prison in Florida,
  where she had been serving a 20-year sentence, to a minimum-security prison
  camp in Texas. Neither her lawyer nor the federal Bureau of Prisons has
  explained the reason for the move, which caused a storm of criticism and
  raised eyebrows as to whether Maxwell get some sort of deal for her
  cooperation. One legal expert said that the release of the transcript was
  Trump “getting what he wants” from the interview in the latest effort to calm
  the political storms around his links to Epstein that have dogged him for
  weeks. “From what we see from this transcript, Trump is getting what he wants.
  She is saying that Trump didn’t do anything untoward, nothing criminal. That’s
  what Trump wants. Ideally, he’d also like names of Democrats who did do
  something wrong, because that’s what the Maga base has been promised,” Dave
  Aronberg, former Democratic state attorney for Palm Beach county, told CNN.
  The House oversight committee has received the first round of Epstein
  documents from the justice department, which includes 33,000 pages of
  documents, according to panel staff. “The committee intends to make these
  records public after thorough review to ensure any victims’ identification and
  child sexual abuse material are redacted,” a spokesperson for the committee
  chair, James Comer, said. “The committee will also consult with the [justice
  department] to ensure any documents released do not negatively impact ongoing
  criminal cases and investigations.” The committee subpoenaed files related to
  Epstein following a public outcry over the administration’s handling of its
  promises to release more information related to Epstein’s conduct and death.
  House Democrats seized on the issue and helped push Comer to subpoena the
  justice department for documents. “The Trump DoJ is providing records at a far
  quicker pace than anything” than it did during Joe Biden’s presidency, the
  committee spokesperson continued.
