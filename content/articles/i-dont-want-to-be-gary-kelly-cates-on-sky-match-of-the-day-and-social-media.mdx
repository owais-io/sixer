  media

  Kelly Cates is about to begin the busiest year of her career. That, to be
  fair, is an estimate, because the football presenter and broadcaster has
  always been a grafter. From Setanta Sports to Channel 5 there are few places
  where she has not applied her blend of deep knowledge and emotional warmth,
  and as of this weekend she will be the face of the BBC’s and Sky’s coverage of
  the Premier League. The action gets under way at a second home, Anfield, from
  where Cates will host Sky’s Friday Night Football coverage of Liverpool v
  Bournemouth. This follows two preview shows for the BBC, and precedes her
  first shift on Match of the Day. Asked whether her schedule might be daunting,
  Cates appears almost bemused. “I’ve just got busy weekends, but I work in
  sports so I expect to have busy weekends,” she says. “It’s not as complicated
  as you think – there’s a very fast train to Manchester.” Cates, speaking at
  Sky’s HQ, says she doesn’t want to sound cliched but “it’s good to keep doing
  new things”. Her new roles are a chance to “keep things fresh”. Having worked
  in the industry for 27 years, starting with a presenting role on the opening
  morning of Sky Sports News, “to get a chance to do something new and still
  have the live football and have so many live games, it’s just really lovely to
  have that balance”. For many years Cates had to endure questions that her
  colleagues don’t; from being a woman in a man’s world to being the daughter of
  a football legend, Sir Kenny Dalglish. She has long since carved out her own
  place in sports broadcasting, however, so when she was approached for the role
  of Match of the Day host, alongside Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan, Sky
  immediately brokered a deal that would keep her on its roster too. While her
  male colleagues may get more attention, usually adjacent to some controversy,
  Cates’s less combative approach has helped to shape contemporary coverage of
  football on TV (and radio). Her more approachable and conversational style is
  suited to the age of podcasting and long‑form interviews. “I think that the
  tone generally has changed to become more conversational on air, and I think
  that’s probably because that’s come from digital,” she says. “A lot of that
  was fan-led and a lot of it was just people starting up on their own at the
  beginning. But I think you can have a conversational tone without having a
  conversation, and you can still interview somebody while having a
  conversational tone.” Cates offers another distinction from many of her peers;
  she is not an avid user of social media. She has no account on X and tends to
  use Instagram to promote her work rather than share her worldview. “I haven’t
  ever really used my social media for that, so it isn’t something that I’m
  going to have to change,” she says. “I think that in a lot of cases, I’m not
  the best-placed person to talk about some of those issues. And I think there’s
  a tendency to believe that if somebody isn’t talking about something they
  don’t care about it. I think it’s perfectly possible to care about something
  and keep quiet and let experts talk about it, which I think is a lot of the
  time better. I always feel like if I couldn’t cope well with being challenged
  heavily on it, then I shouldn’t be putting my opinion out publicly.” That she
  should be asked about her posting reflects the Gary Lineker-shaped presence in
  the room. Cates, Chapman and Logan are being asked by the BBC to team up to
  replace a broadcasting legend, with all the public scrutiny that entails.
  Cates says she has not spoken to Lineker about the job, but defends his
  reputation despite his being a “controversial” figure. “He hasn’t got in touch
  and I haven’t got in touch with him, but not because we’re avoiding each
  other. We just don’t know each other that well. I think [Chapman] was saying
  that Gary said: ‘Why would I tell three broadcasters how to do their job?’
  Which is very lovely of him because he was brilliant at the job. And as much
  as he was a controversial character at times, any focus group that researched
  these things would tell you how much he was adored in that role.” On how she
  will approach following in the footsteps of yet another football legend, Cates
  is matter of fact. “I don’t want to be Gary. I think there’s a temptation to
  try and be someone else, and I think that you get a job because of yourself.
  If then you try to be someone else, it can all just get a bit confused. I
  don’t need another thing to think about. I don’t need to be sitting there
  thinking: ‘What would Gary do?’” Cates has enough talent and experience to
  help her adapt to her new prominence. Britons will see a lot more of her on
  their screens and she will be watching even more football. Is there any
  possibility that more could become too much? “If it was going to happen, it
  would have kicked in by now,” she says with a smile.
