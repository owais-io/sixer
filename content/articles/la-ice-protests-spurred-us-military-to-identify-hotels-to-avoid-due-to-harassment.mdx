  ‘harassment’

  When Donald Trump’s administration escalated immigration raids in Los Angeles
  earlier this summer, protest organizers responded with actions staged in an
  unusual setting: the hotels where immigration officers were staying. Protests
  took place at several southern California hotels where Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement (Ice) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents had been
  spotted. Some activists launched “No sleep for Ice” rallies, with chants and
  music blaring through the night, in hopes of pressuring the hotels to kick
  agents out. Now, public records shared with the Guardian show that the
  protests indeed sent federal agencies scrambling to find hotels for their
  officers in LA where they would not be “harassed”. A 16 June email from the US
  marines shows that military officials made a list of “LA Hotels to Avoid”. The
  information came from multiple law enforcement agencies who were tracking the
  community backlash to Ice and the border patrol, the marines said. The list
  was written by Army North, the domestic defense command deployed on the ground
  during the protests, and reviewed by the navy’s south-west division. The
  documents, obtained by Property of the People, a government transparency
  non-profit, suggest protesters successfully disrupted Trump’s immigration
  crackdown by targeting hotels, though the extent of their impact is not clear
  from the records. An email thread shows a Marine Corps analyst in San Diego
  sent the list of LA hotels to the San Diego Law Enforcement Coordination
  Center (SD-LECC) seeking a similar list of properties to avoid in San Diego.
  The analyst’s duties include “critical infrastructure protection” and their
  name was redacted. The SD-LECC is a fusion center where local, state and
  federal agencies share intelligence. “We have operations in the area and are
  looking to avoid issues wherever possible,” the analyst wrote, saying the LA
  list was based on reports of “harassment of Ice and CBP personnel”.
  Authorities did not disclose the hotel names or further communications to
  Property of the People, so it is also unclear how widely hotel demonstrations
  erupted and were tracked. Spokespeople for the marines and the navy declined
  to comment, deferring to the army, which did not respond to inquiries. The
  Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the hotel
  protests, and in an email on Thursday after publication of this article, a
  spokesperson referred questions to the military. Kristi Laughlin, SD-LECC’s
  deputy director, told the Guardian that SD-LECC was not aware of protests
  taking place at hotels in the San Diego region and did not provide a list in
  response to the military’s request. The military’s apparent efforts to help
  federal personnel avoid demonstrators at hotels came after Trump took the
  extraordinary step of deploying the national guard and marines to respond to
  LA protests. The move polled poorly among US residents and led to reports of
  low morale among troops. Ryan Shapiro, executive director of Property of the
  People, which filed a series of records requests on the LA immigration raids,
  said it was remarkable that US armed forces apparently had to search for
  accommodations where they would not be protested, an unusual predicament he
  attributed to the widespread outrage at the administration. “The document
  reveals that Trump’s nativist crusade, carried out by masked Ice thugs, is so
  widely detested that now the US military feels the need to hide from Americans
  on American soil,” Shapiro said in an email. Advocates involved in the
  protests said the emails seemed to affirm the effectiveness of the
  demonstrations, some of which were organized spontaneously by nearby
  residents. News reports in June chronicled hotel demonstrations across LA
  county municipalities, including Pasadena, Glendale, Long Beach, Whittier,
  Downey, Monrovia and Montebello. “Working-class people saw this as a way to
  participate in the struggle against Ice,” said Ron Gochez, a leading member of
  Unión del Barrio, a group that documents Ice actions in LA. At the height of
  the June raids, his group received five to 10 calls a day from people who had
  spotted immigration officers at hotels, Gochez said. Once the reports were
  verified through photos or hotel employees, Unión del Barrio alerted other
  community groups in their networks. “A lot of hotel workers were not only mad
  about officers staying there, but were in fear because they were
  undocumented,” he said. “People want to make life difficult for these agents
  as they are kidnapping and separating families. And for the agents to
  constantly hear that they are unwanted, that people in society hate what
  they’re doing, that they will go down in history as kidnappers and
  collaborators, I think that gets to them psychologically.” One of the first
  hotel demonstrations took place on 8 June at the AC Hotel in Pasadena, a
  Marriott property, where, according to a state senator, immigration officers
  were lodging and had questioned staff. “We wanted to alert the community that
  Ice was staying at the hotel and let Ice know they were not welcome in
  Pasadena,” said Jose Madera, director of the Pasadena Community Job Center, a
  day laborer center. Widely shared footage showed protesters cheering as
  federal vehicles left the AC Hotel, with agents seen exiting with their bags
  stacked on a cart, the LA Times reported. “It was effective because the
  community organically organized itself, and people did not leave until they
  physically saw the agents leave,” Madera said. “It’s a source of pride for the
  people who live and work in Pasadena that we started this and sparked other
  communities to organize to get Ice out of their hotels … It’s going to take
  many strategies to slow down and stop Ice raids.” At the Glendale Hilton on 12
  June, protesters posted footage of a woman who identified herself as hotel
  management greeting protesters and saying officers had left and would no
  longer be staying there. Representatives of the Glendale and Pasadena hotels
  did not respond to inquiries. “It helped combat this feeling of hopelessness,”
  said Teto Huezo, who was involved in the Glendale protests and is part of an
  LA community self-defense coalition that monitors Ice. He said he hoped more
  protests would pressure hotels to publicly commit to keeping Ice out.
  “Community members should be proud of these wins. The lesson is, we can be so
  much more organized and smarter than these agencies, and when we don’t want
  them in our neighborhoods, we can actually take actions to force them out.”
