  Football will return to Victorian free-to-air television on Saturdays to mark
  the start of the AFLW season, but the first three rounds will be split across
  Channel Seven’s main and secondary channels in a sign the broadcaster is not
  fully convinced of the competition’s ability to draw ratings. The AFL has
  faced criticism this season for its new broadcast deal which has given
  Saturday’s men’s matches exclusively to Foxtel in Victoria, in an attempt to
  increase Thursday night coverage on Seven. While Seven is still finalising its
  AFLW programming, only the season-opening Thursday night double-header of
  Carlton v Collingwood followed by West Coast v Gold Coast, as well as Sunday
  afternoon slots, are set be shown to Victorians on Seven’s main channel over
  the first three rounds. The qualified support for the women’s code from Seven
  comes as AFL head office seeks to accelerate growth in a competition entering
  its tenth season, and address negative perceptions about the AFLW. On Tuesday,
  the AFL chief executive, Andrew Dillon, rejected the language used in a story
  in the Age earlier this month which claimed the AFL told clubs at a CEOs’
  meeting that the AFLW was “losing $50m” each year. “That’s certainly not a
  line that’s ever been run by the AFL, we have a big investment in AFLW, but
  it’s an investment absolutely worth making,” Dillon said. “You can talk about
  direct profit and losses, but I think what’s also important when you look at a
  competition like AFLW, [are] the indirect benefits that we have from having an
  elite women’s competition.” The comments appeared to be a stern response to a
  persistent rhetoric from some in the AFL industry who see the women’s
  competition as a waste of resources. Dillon said people shouldn’t forget the
  impact of the AFLW on helping clubs win grants to build new clubrooms, attract
  new sponsors and retain female fans. This year will see the men’s and women’s
  seasons overlap, triggering a first-ever 18-match mega round. Last AFLW season
  began during the AFL’s pre-finals bye weekend, but this year’s first round
  coincides with round 23 of the AFL. However, the women’s competition will
  still be be prominent on free-to-air, with 11 of 27 matches over the first
  three rounds screened on Seven and 7plus nationally. All matches until the
  finals are shown on Foxtel/Kayo. Dillon this week highlighted the progress in
  AFLW, given it was conceived barely more than a decade ago: “If you’d said
  that we would be here 10 or 11 years later with 18 teams with 30 players,
  being the [league with the] most professional female athletes employed in
  Australia, and the fourth-highest combined salary cap of any sport in
  Australia – men’s or women’s – I would have said you were crazy.” But when
  asked for his reflections on the league’s priorities, he instead offered a
  nostalgic perspective of the early years, when fans came to largely unticketed
  venues in their droves. “If we can make that match-day experience as
  compelling, as engaging maybe as it was in years one and two where there was
  just so much joy in the game … ” he began saying at an AFL summit of hundreds
  of club staff on Tuesday, before amending his language. “ … Not that there’s
  not [joy today], but I think that’s something if we can rediscover that – I
  wouldn’t say it’s a hidden gem because it’s really well known – but I think
  that we’ve got a really solid base from which we can grow.” About 200,000
  attended the 29 matches in the first season in 2017, including almost 25,000
  to Carlton v Collingwood at Ikon Park for the historic opening match. The
  inaugural season had an average crowd of close to 7,000 according to website
  Austadiums. Last year, 108 fully ticketed matches attracted more than 290,000
  fans, but at an average of less than 3,000 a match. The competition now
  appears better set up for the longer term. The league is now settled into its
  late winter/spring window. The compressed fixture of last year has been
  scrapped, and matches in 2025 have been given traditional timeslots. There are
  no midweek fixtures and there has been an effort to build rituals into the
  season such as Indigenous round and Pride , as well as capitalising on the
  men’s grand final week when the Geelong women play at home on Thursday night
  before four AFLW matches in Melbourne on the Friday public holiday. Despite
  the hopes of some players and the construction of new change rooms at the MCG,
  there will be no double-headers with the AFL. Rather, officials are trusting
  that the athleticism and skill of AFLW athletes, some who have now played for
  10 seasons, together with a refined marketing strategy will be enough draw
  more fans to mostly suburban grounds, and offer a television product that
  repays the faith of Channel Seven. “It will be really interesting to see how
  the two-week overlap goes this year in terms of attendance at games and
  viewership,” Dillon said. “But I feel it’s a competition and it’s a game that
  deserves its own time and its time to shine.”
