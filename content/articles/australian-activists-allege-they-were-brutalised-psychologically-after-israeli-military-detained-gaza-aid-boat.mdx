  Two Australian activists say they were “brutalised psychologically” and
  treated “like criminals” by the Israeli military, including being
  strip-searched, shackled and denied external communication, after a boat they
  were on was intercepted and detained while attempting to transport aid to Gaza
  as part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition. The journalist Tania “Tan” Safi and
  human rights activist Robert Martin were among 21 activists on board the
  Handala when it was intercepted on Sunday and transported to Israel. It had
  carried food, baby formula, nappies and medicine, as Palestinians continue to
  starve in what UN-backed hunger experts have called a “worst-case scenario of
  famine” unfolding. On Friday morning local time, the Australians landed at
  Sydney airport after spending days in Israeli custody. Safi told reporters
  they were still “a little bit wobbly” and felt “very sore and weak”. The
  Handala crew had previously confirmed they would go on a hunger strike if the
  Israel Defense Forces intercepted the boat and detained its passengers. “It
  feels like a bit of a dream at the moment to be honest … it’s been a rough
  ride,” Safi said. “We were dehydrated and exhausted. We’ve been disconnected
  from the world.” Safi said at least 30 IDF members boarded Handala when it was
  intercepted, and claimed all were armed, some with four guns. “They knocked me
  in the leg with one of their machine guns,” Safi said. “They were playing this
  odd psychological game of offering water and food with the camera crew, trying
  to get us to accept things from them, but none of us would. We don’t want to
  take anything from an entity that is starving babies to death.” Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email Safi said that after arriving at the port of Ashdod, about
  40km south of Tel Aviv, their bags were taken and they were placed in an
  interrogation room. Many items were still missing, they said. They confirmed
  reports that US labour activist Chris Smalls was physically assaulted by the
  IDF – including being choked and kicked in the legs. “Chris, the only black
  man, was pinned down by seven or eight men,” Safi said. “When I asked about
  him they came into the room and dragged me out by my arms, I’m still bruised
  from it. “They pulled me out and threw me down on the floor, they made me take
  off all my clothes, they strip-searched me right there, made me squat up and
  down … they treated us like we were criminals.” Eventually, Safi said they
  were able to see someone from the Australian embassy, who lobbied for the pair
  to be able to contact their friends and family and to access legal
  representation. “In these prisons, we saw face-to-face the soullessness and
  the cruelty and brutality,” Safi said, adding that they had woken to the
  sounds of a fellow inmate “howling and screaming and crying in pain”. “There
  were moments where they would handcuff me and grab the handcuffs and just
  throw me against the wall.” Martin said he had been “manhandled” along with a
  few others when initially demanding legal representation. “We had no rights …
  I have a lot of medication, they didn’t allow any medication at all,” he said.
  “The Australian government demanded I be able to make phone calls to my loved
  ones, they did not allow me to do that either, and anybody else.” Eventually,
  Martin said, the pair were shackled and transported from Tel Aviv to Jordan.
  In Jordan, they received assistance from the embassy and were taken to
  hospital, where they were temporarily deemed unfit to fly due to their weak
  condition. “We thought they were going to just dump us there, that was very,
  very scary for us, not knowing, having no phone, no money, no access to
  anything,” Martin said. Safi said they did not realise how poor their
  condition was until they were hooked up to the IV in hospital and told they
  were “really unwell”. “I just passed out and slept for like 16 hours,” Safi
  said. “I couldn’t sleep [in prison] … they shine the torch in your face until
  you wake up, or they bang on the door every time you fall asleep. “We did not
  commit any crimes. They tried to get us to sign documents that said we had
  entered Israel illegally, which is not true … we were taken completely against
  our will and brutalised psychologically in every way.” The last boat sent by
  Freedom Flotilla, the Madleen, was intercepted by the Israeli army in
  international waters on 9 June and towed to Ashdod. It carried 12 campaigners
  on board, including the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who were eventually
  expelled by Israel. In 2010, nine flotilla activists en route to Gaza on board
  the Mavi Marmara flagship vessel were shot a total of 30 times by Israeli
  soldiers. Five were killed by close-range gunshot wounds to the head. The
  Israeli embassy in Canberra and Israeli ministry for foreign affairs were
  approached for comment.
