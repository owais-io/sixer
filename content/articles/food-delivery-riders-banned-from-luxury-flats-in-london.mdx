  Food delivery riders from Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats have been barred
  from entering a luxury apartment complex near to where protests against asylum
  seekers have taken place, with management citing media reports that made
  claims about “undocumented” workers. The food delivery companies rejected the
  suggestion they employed undocumented couriers, saying they had robust checks
  and zero-tolerance policies on illegal working. The deliveries ban was linked
  by the east London housing development’s management company, Parkgate Aspen,
  to controversy at a nearby Canary Wharf hotel where protests and
  counter-protests have been taking place because it was believed asylum seekers
  were housed there. In a “security notice” sent to hundreds of flats at the
  Canary Riverside complex, the company said residents had been expressing
  concern about security arrangements in light of the “appropriation of the
  nearby Britannia hotel for migrant housing and the resultant unrest”. The
  notice referred to press reports alleging that some food delivery riders were
  undocumented, adding that the company had been “finalising plans to restrict
  them from entering the blocks as they cannot be allowed to roam around for
  delivery to individual flats”. It added: “With this new situation arising just
  a five-minute walk from your estate, this needs to be implemented
  immediately.” The notice warned that security and concierge staff would no
  longer allow food couriers to be admitted into the blocks. The arrangements
  applied “only to riders from Deliveroo, Just Eat, Uber Eats and the like”, the
  company said in a later email, adding that grocery deliveries by companies
  such as Ocado, Tesco and others may be admitted at residents’ discretion.
  While Parkgate Aspen said feedback about the move had been “overwhelmingly
  positive”, there was unease about what one resident described as a sudden
  “arbitrary ban” on delivery riders, which did not apply to other visitors. “I
  think it illustrates the pernicious knock-on effects of this anti-asylum
  seeker hysteria and how easy it is for authoritarians to seize upon
  provocations to ramp up tensions,” the resident said. A spokesperson for
  Parkgate Aspen told the Guardian that the plan had been in the works for
  months but had required upgrades to access doors to implement fully. “The
  Britannia story prompted many residents to request heightened security, to
  which we responded by fast-tracking the new arrangements,” she said, adding
  that a distinction could be drawn with grocery delivery services like Ocado
  and Tesco because they had fully trained and monitored staff and there was an
  “audit trail” in the event of any negative incidents. “This is not the case
  with food delivery drivers, many of whom are undocumented and on ‘sublet’ from
  the riders registered with the delivery companies,” the spokesperson said.
  Parkgate Aspen said in its follow-up notice that the issue of food deliveries
  to flats had been under discussion since January as a result of increasing
  incidents of bad behaviour, including riders relieving themselves in
  stairwells and verbal abuse of residents, such as those who refused to be
  tailgated into buildings. In response to Parkgate Aspen’s claims, each of the
  food delivery companies said they had strict protocols that riders were
  obliged to adhere to, while measures were in place for audit trails. A
  Deliveroo spokesperson: “Deliveroo takes a zero-tolerance approach to illegal
  working on our platform. If a rider is found to be in breach of the law and
  their obligations, we will terminate their contract.” A Just Eat spokesperson
  said the vast majority of deliveries from Just Eat were completed by
  registered independent couriers. They had a legal right to work and worked
  hard to deliver millions of orders every week, the spokesperson said. They
  added that clear standards and requirements were in place. An Uber Eats
  spokesperson said: “Uber Eats takes a zero-tolerance approach to illegal work.
  This includes introducing state-of-the-art identity and video verification
  technology.” Fresh protests were due to take place outside the Britannia
  International hotel on Marsh Wall on Friday night. While local people,
  including women and children, have been involved, the protests have also been
  heavily promoted by far-right activists and there have been at least four
  arrests. The Britannia was one of the first locations where protests promoted
  by far-right activists gathered steam in the wake of demonstrations outside
  the Bell hotel in Essex, where there have been violent clashes with police.
  The first few protests outside the Britannia were largely peaceful, but
  disturbances on Sunday resulted in several arrests and police served 28-day
  return bans on agitators accused of harassing the hotel’s occupants and trying
  to break through a fence. Supporters of the far right have been among social
  media users claiming that asylum seekers are working as delivery drivers while
  living in the Britannia and that police provided an escort to a “migrant”
  delivery driver. Police have said people who were filmed leaving the hotel on
  mopeds were hotel staff, while a police escort was provided to a delivery
  driver who was delivering to the address.
