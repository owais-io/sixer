  For three days, Mohanad had been lost at sea in an overcrowded wooden boat.
  Travelling across the Mediterranean from Libya to Europe, he and the other
  passengers had run out of food and water, were running out of fuel, and had
  mixed their remaining sugar with sea water to see if they could drink it. “It
  was madness,” he says. Weak and exhausted, passengers began drifting in and
  out of consciousness. Mohanad kept waking up an Ethiopian man – who was nearer
  the edge of the boat – worried he might fall in. At night, there were large
  waves, and Mohanad slept for a while himself, but was woken by a loud splash.
  People began screaming the Ethiopian man’s name. He had slipped over the side
  into the water. They turned the boat around to look for him, but he had
  drowned. On the morning of the third day, the sea was calmer, but no land was
  visible. A white object appeared on the horizon. It got bigger and bigger.
  When the people on the boat with Mohanad saw the letters MSF (Médecins Sans
  Frontières) on the side, they got up to shout and cheer. “I cried,” Mohanad
  says. He urged the others to calm down, and to think of the women and children
  on board, as their boat almost capsized in the excitement. The larger vessel
  was a search and rescue ship called Geo Barents, which was operated by MSF. On
  board, they were given nutritional supplements and water, before being taken
  to a migrant centre in Bari, on the coast of southern Italy. Mohanad was
  overwhelmed with relief, and says it was like being born again. “I just kept
  remembering, I’m not going to go back to Libya.” His hope on arriving in
  Europe was simple: that he would start to be “treated as a human”. Mohanad
  grew up in Darfur, in Sudan. His family are Zaghawa – one of the non-Arab
  ethnic groups in Sudan, targeted by both government forces and armed militia.
  “In my country, there’s a massive amount of discrimination,” he says,
  describing the persecution his people have faced. The Janjaweed militia, which
  evolved into the Rapid Support Forces, has carried out mass killings and
  ethnic cleansing in his region. “They don’t just murder people, it’s the way
  they do it,” Mohanad says – describing rape, mutilation and other
  UN-documented atrocities. “Wherever you go, they ask, ‘What is your tribe?’
  That will determine what happens to you, and how you are treated.” Four of his
  uncles were killed by snipers in an attack on their village when he was a
  child. “I witnessed a lot of horrible stuff,” he says. His family escaped on a
  lorry – he still remembers seeing swollen bodies by the road, and ransacked
  shops. From then they were often on the move, going from city to camp. He
  remembers a child who got sick in one of the camps where he lived. The child’s
  mother couldn’t afford to pay for basic medicine, so the child died. He also
  remembers visiting a large hospital, overflowing with patients, but with only
  one doctor to treat them all. He decided he wanted to become a doctor. Mohanad
  was clever; his mother had worked as a teacher before the family was
  displaced, and she encouraged him to attend school wherever they were. He
  continued to study while he worked to help support his family – selling food,
  drink, sometimes clothes. When he was 18, he was accepted into a medical
  school in a town near the camp where they lived. “I was so excited,” he says.
  Those first weeks at university were the “best of my life”. It was a big
  chance for him – very few people from the camp got to study at this level.
  But, like others on the course, he was disappointed by the poor teaching, the
  lack of basic services such as water or electricity, and the focus on subjects
  such as Arabic studies, at the expense of community medicine, which was
  covered in only a few days (in other parts of Sudan, the topic was taught over
  a whole year). “We said, if they don’t teach us properly, we can’t help
  people, it will put lives at risk,” he says. He was threatened by the
  vice-chancellor, who told him to keep quiet, or he would be “silenced”, but he
  kept asking for improvements, sending messages to the university, and
  attending demonstrations with other students. He was arrested twice for taking
  part in protests in 2018, and, he says, treated more harshly because of his
  ethnicity. After being detained, “some people disappear, no one knows what’s
  happened to them, but they are probably dead”. He doesn’t want to go into
  details about the prison he was held in, but says, “the point is, you will be
  worried after that”. He knew, once he got out, that he had to leave
  immediately. He didn’t dare to even say goodbye to his family. He was 19. Now
  the authorities had his details, he was worried he’d be caught at one of the
  many checkpoints and sent back to prison. “You have to leave in secret, you
  have to choose an illegal route, just in order to leave the country. I would
  never, ever have been allowed to fly, the government would have arrested me.”
  Mohanad knew a truck driver, who transported sheep, okra, tomatoes and kidney
  beans. He hid among the vegetables and spent three days travelling from place
  to place via remote roads, heading north, hiding at every checkpoint, until he
  made it over the border into Libya. He was unprepared for what he found there.
  In Libya, Mohanad was kidnapped repeatedly – he lost count of how many times.
  “We migrants call it hell on earth,” he says. “They will capture people and
  call their family and ask for money.” The first time this happened was not
  long after he entered the country. He was in the middle of nowhere, in the
  desert. A man offered to help him, and he said yes, without hesitation – he
  thought he might die out there. The man took him to a farm, and locked Mohanad
  up, before transferring him to a place with many others. At this point, he was
  told he had to pay thousands of dollars to be released. He didn’t have that
  kind of money. So they kept him, and he worked for free, for six months,
  barely fed, mixing concrete and carrying materials, on a series of building
  sites. Sometimes other people came on site, like engineers. “They didn’t know
  we were victims of human traders,” he says. He tried to ask them questions, to
  find out where they were, but had to do this out of earshot of the gang
  members. After six months, he escaped by asking one of the visitors for a lift
  to a nearby town, pretending he wanted to get some cigarettes. He had learned
  enough of the local dialect to get by, and after this he sometimes managed to
  evade capture for a few months, but it kept on happening. Sometimes he was
  caught travelling between cities, sometimes he escaped by bribing the police
  or jumping out of a car. The kidnappers often began by promising him work.
  “Then when you get in their car, they start swearing at you, they show you
  their pistol, or their machine gun.” He was beaten hard and saw people shot in
  front of him. “It’s a sequence. If you get lucky you escape, or someone you
  know pays for you. If not, you may get killed, punished, burned with liquid
  plastic on your back, or they pull out your nails.” He spent three years in
  Libya – most of the time trying to get out. Some Sudanese people helped him
  for a while, offering him food and a place to stay. He applied to the United
  Nations to be resettled as a refugee. “If they sent me to another safe African
  country, I would have gone,” he says. But he waited, and nothing happened, and
  then he was kidnapped again. After a while, risking the dangerous sea crossing
  to Europe began to seem like his only hope of escape. “You have no choice. In
  Libya you will never be safe, and you can’t go home – so going over the sea
  becomes the least dangerous option.” Mohanad had friends who had died trying
  to leave Libya – shot while they were trying to escape armed gangs, or
  drowning at sea. More than once, he was cheated by smugglers – he paid money
  for a place on a boat, but when he went to meet them, they tipped off another
  contact, and he was captured again. “We were just victims of their business …
  They’d say on the phone, ‘I have 70 heads’ – they don’t even call you people.”
  It took him a year to save up for that last boat trip. “The guy, he was OK. He
  put us on the sea. It was a small boat but there were a lot of people, and it
  couldn’t take us all.” After he arrived in Italy, he was taken to a huge,
  overcrowded migrant centre near Bari. “They register you, and they say ‘share
  this room’, but there are only eight beds, and 16 or 17 people.” There were
  people who had been waiting there for months, so a group of them decided to
  leave – Mohanad took a bus to a border town, where a lot of people were
  sleeping rough. He spoke to others who hoped things might be better over the
  border in France. At the border, a French official asked him where he was
  going, and he said, “I have no idea.” They gave him a piece of paper saying he
  had to leave France within three days, and one of the officials suggested
  going to Paris and on to Calais – he understood that there would be food and
  help there. At that point, he didn’t even know that Calais was on the coast.
  By then, Mohanad was in a group of seven or eight people, from Sudan, Syria
  and Chad. They moved through France, sleeping on the streets, travelling on
  trains without a ticket, until the guard or the police threw them off. Between
  trains, they wandered around all night, freezing cold, in the rain, searching
  for shelter. They had a few biscuits from Bari, which soon ran out. In Dijon,
  the rain fell all night, but they met a kind Nigerian, who gave them food in
  his own home. “If I had a chance, I would thank him now, it was an amazing
  thing that he did for us.” “We had no idea about claiming to be a refugee or
  an asylum seeker. No one advised us,” Mohanad says. Other migrants directed
  them to Calais, where there were charities providing food, but he was sleeping
  rough – locals threw glass bottles at him and he says he experienced a lot of
  racism. He discovered that many people there were trying to cross the Channel.
  “I just wanted a warm place, a safe place,” he says. French police confiscated
  any tents they had. Mohanad tried to help some younger Sudanese teenagers, but
  one of them was killed boarding a truck, and another was badly wounded in an
  attack. In September 2021, Mohanad crossed to the UK, hidden in a vehicle. He
  climbed inside, in the early morning – he couldn’t see out, but knew when they
  started driving again that they’d reached England. They stopped in the late
  afternoon, when the driver began to unload his boxes at a factory near
  Birmingham. Mohanad jumped out and ran away, because he was worried the driver
  would be angry. “The driver was very surprised.” It was a sunny day, and
  everything looked different – he noticed that people seemed friendlier than in
  France. He asked a couple of passersby for help, until a woman pushing a buggy
  showed him the way to the nearest police station. “I said to them ‘Hello, is
  this a police station?’” he says. “They said, ‘Are you alright? What’s the
  problem, where did you come from?’ I said I come from Sudan. I came by lorry.”
  The absurdity of it makes him smile. “They were surprised. How did you come
  from Sudan, and end up in Birmingham?” He says the police were kind and
  offered him food. At first, he knew nothing about the system here, but after a
  month, when he was told about the option to claim asylum, Mohanad did so. He
  spent 15 months in asylum accommodation in Yorkshire, first in hotels and then
  in a shared house, waiting for a decision. At first, just having somewhere
  safe to stay and a bed to sleep in was a huge relief, but the uncertainty and
  not being able to work was unsettling. “You have nothing to do,” he says. He
  had flashbacks, and was diagnosed with PTSD. Things improved when he started
  volunteering with the Refugee Council on a healthcare project, where he was
  trained to give advice and support to other refugees. This gave him a chance
  to speak to people, a bit of experience in how the NHS works, and also a sense
  of purpose. He says he’s experienced less racism in the UK than in France or
  elsewhere. But he never felt fully part of the community until he was granted
  asylum, and was accepted as a refugee. “When I got my papers, it was the same
  feeling as being rescued at sea. I thought, ‘Yes, I can live.’” Mohanad found
  a room, and last year, thanks partly to his experience with the Refugee
  Council, he enrolled on an access to medicine course. He passed the science
  elements with a distinction, but struggled to reach the required level in
  English. For now, he’s looking for work as a security guard or in a warehouse,
  but he still hopes to keep studying medicine, and has also applied to
  volunteer at a local hospital. Since he left Sudan, the war has spread, and he
  is worried about his family. “I know war, it’s not something new to me. But to
  see the whole of Sudan in that pain, you can’t describe it. The same militia
  are killing and murdering and raping people. They took control of my whole
  region, except for one city. To see the same thing, ethnic killings, genocide
  …” He says he’d like the world to pay more attention to Sudan. Sudanese
  refugees who do make it to safety here, against the odds, face hostile
  policies. “Now there’s a plan to refuse citizenship to refugees,” Mohanad
  says. “If I spend my whole life here, I will remain a refugee, a second class
  or even third class citizen. It feels as if they can just deport me. I started
  worrying again,” he says. “They say we have to come here legally – so why
  don’t you provide safe routes?” He says it would be better if there were a
  realistic way to apply for refugee status before travelling to the UK. There
  are no schemes to help people from Sudan, he points out, and getting an
  aeroplane, let alone securing a visa, is impossible for most. He didn’t set
  out to come to the UK, he says – he wanted to stay in Sudan and become a
  doctor – but that wasn’t possible, and he left to save his life. Making this
  journey is how he survived.
