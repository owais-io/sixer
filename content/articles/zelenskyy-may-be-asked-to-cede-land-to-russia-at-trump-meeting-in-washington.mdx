  Ukraine’s president has said he will fly to Washington on Monday to meet
  Donald Trump after the Alaska summit amid speculation that the US president
  will ask him to cede territory to end the war. Next week’s meeting will mark
  the first return to the White House for Volodymyr Zelenskyy since his infamous
  row with Trump and the vice-president, JD Vance, in the Oval Office in
  February. “President Trump informed [me] about his meeting with the Russian
  leader and the main points of their discussion,” Zelenskyy wrote, following an
  hour-long one-to-one phone call after Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin.
  Zelenskyy did not spell out the key points of discussion between Trump and
  Putin. Later, the president’s chief communications adviser said they “haven’t
  heard anything” about a possible air ceasefire before a trilateral summit, a
  proposal posted on social media by a journalist. Trump told Fox News after the
  summit that the swapping of territory in Ukraine was discussed with Putin –
  something Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out. “I think those are points that
  we negotiated, and those are points that we largely have agreed on,” the US
  president said. “I think we’re pretty close to a deal,” he added : “Ukraine
  has to agree to it. Maybe they’ll say no.” After their call, Trump said on
  Truth Social that he expected to see Zelenskyy on Monday afternoon, and that
  “if all works out we then will schedule a meeting with president Putin” though
  the Russian leader has previously been reluctant to meet his Ukrainian
  counterpart. The US president also said “the best way to end the horrific war”
  would be “to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and
  not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up”. With Russia
  and Ukraine far apart in their demands, it is not clear how easily that could
  be achieved. European leaders joined the call for a further half an hour,
  Zelenskyy added, emphasising that “it is important that Europeans are involved
  at every stage to ensure reliable security guarantees together with America”.
  Those joining the call included the leaders of the UK, France, Germany and
  Italy: Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, Friedrich Merz and Giorgia Meloni
  respectively; as well as the Polish and Finnish presidents, Karol Nawrocki and
  Alexander Stubb; the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, and the president of
  the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. Shortly after, a second phone
  call took place, this time between Zelenskyy and various European leaders, to
  discuss what they had learned from Trump’s account of the summit. There were
  “positive signals” from the US, Zelenskyy said in his update, “regarding
  participation in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security”, echoing diplomatic language
  from last week in the run-up to the summit. Previously, the US has declined to
  spell out how it might help prevent a future outbreak of fighting as part of a
  peace agreement, leading to speculation that Washington was hoping to leave
  the safeguarding of Ukraine almost entirely to Europe. A joint statement from
  the leaders of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the EU
  thanked Trump for his mediation efforts, and said they hoped to work towards
  “a trilateral summit with European support”. The group said Ukraine “must have
  ironclad security guarantees” and welcomed Trump’s statement that “the US is
  prepared to give security guarantees”. Reuters reported that there was a
  discussion of extending a Nato-style guarantee to Ukraine, though the US
  position on this was not clear. The leaders also declared “it will be up to
  Ukraine to make decisions on its territory” and that “international borders
  must not be changed by force”. The group said they would be willing to
  implement further economic sanctions against Russia if necessary. In a
  separate statement, Starmer said that while progress had been made, “the next
  step must be further talks involving president Zelenskyy” and he emphasised
  that “the path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him”. Meloni said
  “the most interesting developments” at the summit were regarding future
  security guarantees for Ukraine. She highlighted an earlier Italian proposal
  “inspired by Nato’s article 5”, a clause that states alliance members will
  come to each other’s aid if one is attacked. “The starting point of the
  proposal is the definition of a collective security clause that would allow
  Ukraine to benefit from the support of all its partners, including the USA,
  ready to take action in case it is attacked again,” she said. Pressure on
  Russia had to be maintained, Macron said in a social media post. “Any lasting
  peace must be accompanied by unwavering security guarantees,” he added,
  welcoming “the readiness of the United States to contribute”. Meanwhile,
  fighting continued for the 1,270th day since Russia launched its full-scale
  invasion in February 2022. Three people were killed and 12 wounded in the
  southern frontline region of Kherson, its governor reported on Saturday.
  Ukraine’s Azov brigade said it cleared Russian saboteur groups from six
  villages as it began to close down a breach in the frontline near Dobropillia,
  in the eastern Donetsk province. The unit claimed it had killed 271 Russian
  soldiers and wounded 101. Ukraine’s air force said one ballistic missile and
  85 drones and decoys were launched into the country, and it had shot down 61
  of the latter. Russia said it had taken two villages on the frontline and
  Ukraine said it had lost another near Pokrovsk.
