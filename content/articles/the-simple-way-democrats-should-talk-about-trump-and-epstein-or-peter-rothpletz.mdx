  Democrats must not let Jeffrey Epstein die. They must highlight how this saga
  exposes the president for who he has always been. In the decade Teflon Don has
  spent on the national stage, no scandal has stuck to and haunted him quite so
  viscerally as the Epstein affair. He’s never before appeared so flustered,
  forced to answer question after question about the women and girls whose lives
  were destroyed by his former “best friend”. The world may never know what is
  inside the so-called “Epstein files”. What is clear is that the contents are
  damaging enough for the president and his human flak jackets to call the whole
  affair a “hoax”, recess Congress to prevent a vote on releasing the materials
  and send the deputy attorney general to visit Tallahassee, Florida, to speak
  to the convicted child sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, who was subsequently
  moved to a “cushy”, celebrity-riddled minimum security prison in Bryan, Texas.
  As the conservative pundit Bill Kristol noted over the weekend: “[Richard
  Nixon] said of Watergate, ‘I gave them a sword. And they stuck it in, and they
  twisted it with relish.’ Trump may have given us a sword. We should use it.”
  Kristol is right, to a point. Liberals, progressives and never-Trump
  Republicans must not let voters forget Trump’s festering, open wound without
  neglecting the kitchen table, cost-of-living matters that hurt them last fall.
  In 2007, a far sharper and far more spry Joe Biden delivered a quip so clever
  and cutting that it ended another man’s entire political career. Rudy Giuliani
  was never able to recover after Biden observed how it seemed “there’s only
  three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb, and 9/11”. The line
  was funny because it was true; it was lethal because it exposed the emptiness
  behind the former New York City mayor’s tragedy-fueled candidacy. This is the
  challenge for Democrats: how do they maintain a spotlight on a scandal that
  reveals Trump for who he is in a way that finally resonates with his base
  without appearing to exploit a tragedy, à la Giuliani? They must ground the
  abstract conspiracy in everyday terms relatable to the average American. It
  goes like this: Trump protects elites. Say it in every stump speech, vent
  about it in vertical videos and keep it alive as a dominant narrative in the
  zeitgeist. Do not back away. The modern media environment rewards repetition
  and omnipresence, so Hakeem Jeffries should promise an Epstein select
  committee, Chuck Schumer should make Republicans release the Epstein files in
  return for votes to fund the government, and every leftwing activist in the
  country should be burying Pam Bondi’s justice department in a blizzard of
  Freedom of Information Act requests. In doing so, recognize that the response
  to the scandal is an encapsulation of a deeper truth that voters already feel.
  The president and the GOP protect the elite at the expense of ordinary
  Americans. Savvier Democrats get this. Some of the party’s best communicators
  have already been grasping for a message along these lines, as seen in the
  focus on Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) and
  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders’s nationwide Fighting Oligarchy
  tour. But while those efforts have paid some political dividends, they have
  not come close to capturing the public imagination to the degree the Epstein
  files have. For at least some portion of the Maga movement, the past three
  weeks have finally managed to expose Trump for the hobnobbing, name-dropping,
  pompous ass that he’s always been. Why is this one particular story so
  effective – especially as most voters have known Trump to be a plutocratic
  wannabe for decades? Maggie Haberman’s hypothesis is noteworthy: New York high
  society operates in two concentric circles. The Big Apple has a glittering
  “elite” with status at the center of a broader ring that wields power. Trump
  has always tried to straddle those rings, painting himself as the renegade
  billionaire. The Epstein affair shatters that mythos. It casts him not as a
  brash, bull-in-a-china-shop outsider but as the ultimate insider, rubbing
  shoulders with the very aristocracy his campaign rhetoric promised to upend.
  Democrats must lead with Epstein. Then they need to connect it to the
  president’s myriad failures. Why did Trump cut taxes for the richest Americans
  while cutting Medicaid in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act? For the same reason
  he is protecting Epstein and his buddies. Why is Trump risking union jobs in
  auto manufacturing so he can have a trade spat with Mexico and Canada? For the
  same reason he is protecting Epstein and his buddies. Why is Donald Trump
  talking about firing the head of the Fed? For the same reason he is protecting
  Epstein and his buddies. Mallory McMorrow of Michigan, a Democratic Senate
  candidate, is already reading from this script. In recent weeks, she has
  demonstrated mastery in pairing Epstein with broader anti‑elite rhetoric. In
  one vertical video, she emphatically declared: This is exactly why there’s
  eroding trust in our institutions, because until we confront the rot that
  exists in our institutions, until we hold everyone, everyone accountable under
  the same set of rules and laws, we will keep living in a country where there
  are two systems of justice, one for the rich and powerful, and one for
  everybody else. We deserve better. Release the files now. Trump’s friendship
  with Epstein is a proof point for elite favoritism and all of us who oppose
  the orange god king must use it to condemn inequality and unaccountable power
  within the GOP ecosystem. The Epstein scandal has captured our attention not
  just because it’s a lurid horror story, but because it confirms a truth people
  already believe: the rich view them as objects for exploitation. And if
  there’s one thing Trump has successfully messaged to all Americans, it’s that
  he’s very, very rich. Epstein is the story. But he is also a stand-in for
  every closed maternity ward in a rural county, for every mom choosing between
  insulin and groceries and for every veteran battling the Department of
  Veterans Affairs while Silicon Valley billionaires buy senators. Democrats’
  message is simple enough, actually: “Trump and the GOP protect the elite. They
  abandon you.” Think this messaging can be overdone? Look no further than
  Benghazi, a truly made-up scandal, which Republicans turned into a true
  political liability with Hillary Clinton’s emails. That story stuck because of
  repetition and omnipresence, but also because it struck a chord with something
  Americans already believed: that the Clinton family viewed themselves as above
  accountability. Even Trump’s own supporters are asking hard questions. Where
  are the files? Why is there a two-tiered system of justice? Why is Trump more
  interested in protecting his friends than releasing the truth? The Democratic
  response should be a noun, a verb and Jeffrey Epstein, and then the rot at the
  core of the American system. Deployed effectively, it can be as impactful and
  as memorable as Trump’s cruel but devastating 2024 attack line: “Kamala is for
  they/them, President Trump is for you.” Trump protects elites. That’s why
  Trump is protecting Epstein’s circle. But who’s protecting you? Peter
