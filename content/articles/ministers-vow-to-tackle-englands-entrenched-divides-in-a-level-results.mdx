  Ministers have vowed to tackle England’s “entrenched” educational gaps that
  are leaving some regions and groups trailing far behind their peers and
  closing off options such as university for many of their school leavers.
  A-level results published on Thursday showed an improving national picture,
  with a higher proportion of young people gaining top grades. But the
  improvements faded outside London, the south-east and big cities. While one in
  three entries from 18-year-olds in London gained A* or A grades, fewer than
  one in four did so in the north-east of England, where results remain below
  pre-pandemic levels seen in 2019. London’s advantage means that the university
  application rate for its students remains considerably above all other English
  regions, even as record numbers of school leavers accepted offers to begin
  higher education courses this autumn. The Department for Education said that
  the results “have exposed inequalities which continue to exist in the
  education system”, which it aims to tackle in a schools white paper later this
  year. Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said: “Every single young
  person collecting their results should have the opportunity to pursue their
  dreams – whether that starts with further study, university, an apprenticeship
  or the world of work – but too often, opportunities depend on background
  rather than talent. “The entrenched divide in outcomes seen over the last few
  years and the lack of progress for children from white working-class
  backgrounds is particularly concerning.” Carl Cullinane, director of research
  at the Sutton Trust, which campaigns to improve social mobility through
  education, said: “If the government is going to break down barriers to
  opportunity, the growth in regional inequalities must be reversed. “It’s
  positive that increasing numbers of young people from the most deprived areas
  are getting into university. This is important, because gaining a university
  degree remains the surest route to social mobility. However, today’s figures
  show the gap between the most and least deprived areas remains wide, and worse
  than before the pandemic in 2019.” Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the
  Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Schools and colleges face
  severe funding and staffing shortages, and these students were affected by the
  disruption of the pandemic earlier in their education. They have overcome the
  odds and we salute the fantastic efforts of our brilliant education staff.
  “However, we continue to see big differences in attainment between regions,
  reflecting socioeconomic factors which represent a massive challenge, not only
  for the education sector but our society as a whole. “We have to stop merely
  talking about these issues and actually address them with investment in
  communities suffering from generational disadvantage. This cannot be solved by
  schools and colleges alone but must also involve action to boost the
  opportunities available for young people.” More than 28% of entries in England
  gained an A or A* grade, while 9.4% gained the top A* grade, higher rates than
  in 2024 or 2019, the last year before the disruption of the Covid pandemic
  when 25.2% of entries received top grades. Ofqual, the exam regulator for
  England, rejected accusations of grade inflation, saying that the increase in
  top grades was the result of fewer students taking A-levels, and young men in
  particular shifting towards subjects such as physics, maths and economics with
  greater success. Amanda Swann, Ofqual’s executive director for general
  qualifications, said that “any change in numbers achieving a grade is entirely
  due to a change in student performance, not a change in the standard
  expected”, with this year’s cohort of students appearing to be academically
  stronger than last year’s. Results in Wales followed a similar pattern to
  England’s, with declining numbers of students taking A-levels and top grades
  rising among the remaining stronger candidates. For the second year in row the
  proportion of A* grades rose, to 10.5%. In Northern Ireland, 8.7% of entries
  achieved an A*, compared with 8.2% in 2024, while 30.4% of entries achieved
  grades A* or A, fractionally higher than last year. More than 200,000 students
  across the UK also received BTec level 3 qualifications, but a breakdown of
  results was not available. One in five working-age adults in the UK has at
  least one BTec, although the popular qualification remains under threat from
  government policy in England. In England nearly 12,000 young people received
  results for T-levels, vocational qualifications first introduced in 2020 that
  have struggled to attract students. Although entries have increased
  substantially, T-levels remain less popular than A-level PE. The DfE also
  revealed that 27% of students originally enrolled on the two-year course
  dropped out or failed to complete it.
