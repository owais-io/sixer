  Green olives, which are picked when they’re under-ripe, tend to be more bitter
  than black ones, but that bitterness also brings with it depth and complexity.
  Many of the cheaper olives I tasted have a strong, wine-vinegar acidity that I
  don’t really enjoy straight from the jar. I do, however, appreciate that punch
  when they’re paired with other ingredients: sliced on pizza, tossed into
  salads or, my favourite, skewered with an anchovy and a pickled guindilla
  pepper to make that classic Basque pintxo, the gilda. Salty olives are also
  brilliant for seasoning dishes such as tagines or in a tapenade crust for
  roast chicken – just remember to season after they’ve imparted their salty
  flavour. This tasting led me to reconsider what makes a green olive excellent.
  The test group were all completely different, ranging from ones with rich
  olive oil and woody herb tones and a great meaty texture to others with strong
  acidic tones balanced by sweet apple notes. All are delicious in their own
  way, and considering that I’m not usually a fan of pitted green olives, I was
  impressed by the overall quality. *** The best supermarket pitted green olives
  *** Best overall: Realfoods by Organico organic green pitted olives £3.80 for
  230g at Ocado (£1.65/100g) ★★★★☆ A large Greek olive with a speckled skin and
  fresh aroma. Floral and salty, with almond and artichoke notes. The texture is
  perfect – meaty with a good, fleshy bite. Certified organic, B Corp and a
  Planet-Score of A for sustainability. Good value with impressive
  certifications, which earns them a bonus point. *** Best bargain: Epicure
  manzanilla olives £1.60 for 235g at Fennel &amp; Ginger (68p/100g) £1.75 for
  235g at Ocado (£0.74/100g) ★★★★☆ Manzanilla olives from a century-old brand
  founded in London in 1891. Muted green colour with a gentle, olive oil aroma.
  Sweet, complex flavour with low acidity, light umami fermentation, and almond
  and beechwood notes. Good crunch and mild bitterness. A beautiful product and
  great value. *** And the rest … M&amp;S pitted green queen olives £2.40 for
  225g at Ocado (£1.07/100g) ★★★★☆ A large gordal olive with a pungent, acidic
  and noticeably piquant first taste. Develops complexity with green tomato and
  earthy, twiggy notes. Meaty yet fibrous. Handpicked in Andalucía. Good
  provenance and solid value for the quality. *** Biona organic pitted green
  olives £3.70 for 280g at Ocado (£1.32/100g) ★★★★☆ Large, pale green and
  perfectly formed. A subtle aroma, and notably less salty than many of the
  others. Mild but complex flavour – sweet, almondy and earthy. Meaty and fleshy
  texture. Handpicked in Cerignola, Italy. Certified organic and good value
  overall. *** Sainsbury’s So Organic pitted green olives £2.85 for 290g at
  Sainsbury’s (98p/100g) ★★★★☆ A large olive with a dark khaki hue and a mild
  acidic aroma. Lovely, complex, savoury flavour with hints of olive oil and
  woody herbs and a fabulously meaty texture. Organic-certified and sourced from
  the Rovies region of Greece. Really good value for an organic product. ***
  Ponti organic pitted green olives £5 for 250g at Ocado (£2/100g) ★★★★☆ A tiny,
  pale green olive with a subtle, fruity scent. Complex, sweet flavour with
  notes of chardonnay and green fig, plus a light acidity. Firm bite. An Italian
  heritage brand since 1787, B-Corp certified and organic. A leap in price
  compared with some of the others, but a product with obvious quality. *** Gaea
  pitted green olives £2.40 for 290g at Morrisons (83p/100g) £3.50 for 290g at
  Ocado (£1.21/100g) ★★★☆☆ A large, light yellow olive-green with a mildly
  floral aroma. Sweet with grassy notes and hints of cucumber and nuttiness.
  Meaty texture with a strong skin and bite. Made from green chalkidiki olives,
  with a simple brine using lemon juice and salt. Good value for a clean-tasting
  product. *** Fragata stoneless green olives £1.95 for 335g at Tesco (58p/100g)
  ★★★☆☆ Fresh, complex aroma with classic wine-vinegar notes. A heavy acid punch
  upfront, followed by deep olive flavour with a touch of sweetness and appley
  tones. Nice, ripe crunch. A classic olive with solid provenance from
  Andalucía. Excellent value and notably water-efficient, using 60% less than
  Spain’s average, according to the Water Footprint Network. *** Waitrose
  Essential pitted green olives £3.50 for 450g at Waitrose (78p/100g) ★★☆☆☆
  Fresh aroma and light green colour. Bright initial flavour with gentle salt,
  acidity and classic bitterness, before finishing on a twiggy note. Soft
  texture. No information on origin or variety, but good value. *** Hellenic Sun
  pitted jumbo green olives £3 for 330g at Ocado (91p/100g) £16.14 for six x
  330g at Amazon (82p/100g) ★★☆☆☆ Classic lactic acid aroma and speckled, muted
  green colour. Very salty with a mildly earthy flavour. The jumbo size gives
  these a great meaty texture. Handpicked in Greece, though details are limited.
  Not the best, but decent value for a big olive, especially if you need a salty
  one.
