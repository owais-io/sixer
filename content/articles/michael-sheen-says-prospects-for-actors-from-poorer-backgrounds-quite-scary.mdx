  Michael Sheen has warned the pathways that helped him break into acting have
  all but collapsed, as he said the “bank of mum and dad” would be unable to
  support aspiring actors from poorer communities. The Good Omens star, who grew
  up in the working class community of Port Talbot, said he had benefited from
  school support, youth theatres and grants that have since come under financial
  pressure or been abolished entirely. He said his journey was also aided by a
  supportive family and the knowledge that his home town had already produced
  acting royalty in Richard Burton and Sir Anthony Hopkins. However, he said the
  prospect for actors from underprivileged backgrounds now looked “quite scary”.
  “Having those school plays where the drama was happening in my school – then
  there was a youth theatre that was funded through the education department of
  the council, and then I got a grant to go to drama school,” said Sheen, who
  was speaking at an event opening the Edinburgh TV festival. “So just to get to
  the point of going to drama school, all of those things sort of had to be in
  place. All of those things have gone, essentially. “It does worry me that for
  young people who might want to get into this – if you are relying on the bank
  of mum and dad – it’s really tough to even just go and live in London, or move
  to wherever. That’s why it’s so important we get stuff out of London and
  around the country.” His comments come amid wider concern in the TV world
  about narrowing access. A crisis in the industry has left many established
  freelance workers out of a job as production has slowed down and the industry
  adapts to fast-changing consumption habits. It has led to fears that those
  without resources behind them will be the first forced out of an industry that
  already faces allegations of having too many privately educated executives.
  Sheen said there were schemes to support actors from all backgrounds, but he
  feared they came too late in life to help some talented children. He advocated
  for a system more like football scouting, spotting talent at a younger age.
  “It needs to be like football,” he said. “You need to get them when they’re
  six, seven years old – start supporting people much younger and help them,
  because a lot of people are just never going to get to the point where they
  get picked up in these sorts of programmes and projects.” Sheen said he was
  trying to address the issue with his new Welsh National Theatre, whose first
  production, Our Town, by the US playwright Thornton Wilder, has been put
  through a “Welsh lens” by the Doctor Who writer Russell T Davies. Sheen said
  that he was now able to spend time helping his home community in Port Talbot
  thanks to his success as an actor. However, he revealed he did not have
  immediate success in Hollywood, initially finding himself spending “most of my
  time sitting in diners, reading Stephen King novels and doing very little”. He
  said it was only when he played Tony Blair in the Channel 4 drama The Deal in
  2003, which led to him playing the former prime minister again in The Queen
  three years later, that his Hollywood career took off. “I’ve gone from sitting
  in diners reading Stephen King novels on my own completely, to then having a
  very different life and opening up all kinds of opportunities back here as
  well as over there – and suddenly having a bit of choice and all those kinds
  of things.”
