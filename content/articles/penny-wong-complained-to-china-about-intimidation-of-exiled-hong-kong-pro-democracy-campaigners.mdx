  The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, complained about the targeted
  intimidation of exiled pro-democracy campaigners from Hong Kong directly to
  her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, during a bilateral meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
  The July meeting was the first face-to-face discussion between the pair since
  two Hong Kong activists wanted for alleged national security crimes were
  subjected to anonymous letters offering Australian neighbours $203,000 to
  inform on them. The letters are now being investigated by the countering
  foreign interference taskforce, which is led by Australia’s federal police and
  the domestic intelligence agency. Government sources confirmed Wong privately
  reiterated her public criticism of the targeting of Adelaide-based Ted Hui and
  Melbourne-based Kevin Yam. Her office previously described their treatment as
  “reprehensible” and a threat to “our national sovereignty”. While Australia’s
  consul general in Hong Kong had previously raised concerns about the letters
  with local officials, Wong’s elevation of the issue during a meeting on the
  sidelines of the Asean summit has not been revealed until now. Hui, an
  Australian resident and former Hong Kong politician, was also the subject of
  fake pamphlets that accused him of being a pro-Israel lawyer willing to “wage
  war” against Islamic terrorism. The letters were mailed to a mosque near his
  workplace and included his contact details. Hui and Yam are wanted by Hong
  Kong authorities for allegedly breaching a controversial national security law
  that grants authorities sweeping extraterritorial powers to prosecute acts or
  comments made anywhere in the world that it deems criminal. Sign up: AU
  Breaking News email “We have consistently expressed our strong objections to
  China and Hong Kong on the broad and extraterritorial application of Hong
  Kong’s national security legislation and we will continue to do so,” a
  spokesperson for Wong said. “Freedom of expression and assembly are essential
  to our democracy.” The letters and pamphlets were mailed from Hong Kong or
  Macau, a special administrative region of China. Hong Kong authorities have
  denied sending the letters but this has not convinced the Australian
  government. Yam, who has previously accused Hong Kong of interfering with his
  “fundamental freedoms and democratic rights as an Australian”, said he was
  grateful the minister had raised the issue with her Chinese counterpart.
  “Transnational repression can be devastating in forms both brazen and subtle
  and I hope the government will take all these different forms with the utmost
  seriousness,” Yam said. Hui, who was convicted in absentia for his role in
  pro-democracy protests during 2019, said Wong’s decision to raise the issue
  with Yi was “the right move”. “Australians need to see that we’re not trading
  away everything just to restore economic ties,” Hui said. In late July, Hong
  Kong also issued an arrest warrant for the Australian pro-democracy campaigner
  Dr Feng Chongyi, who is a professor of China studies at the University of
  Technology Sydney. Feng was one of 19 people accused of taking part in the
  unofficial Hong Kong Parliament, a pro-democracy organisation based in Toronto
  that Hong Kong authorities say is intended to subvert state power. The group’s
  website states that “through democratic means, we are committed to
  safeguarding our community, defending the rule of law, and exposing the CCP’s
  system of governance for what it is: authoritarianism masked as legitimacy”.
  Hong Kong authorities have placed a smaller $39,000 bounty on Feng for his
  involvement in the group. In 2017, he was detained for 10 days while on a
  research trip to China. Speaking to the ABC in July, Feng described the arrest
  warrant as “political persecution and violation of basic human rights”. Wong’s
  spokesperson said “Australia strongly objects to Hong Kong authorities issuing
  arrest warrants for pro-democracy advocates in Australia”. China’s embassy in
  Australia was contacted for comment. In July 2023, China’s foreign ministry
  spokesperson Mao Ning urged Australia, the UK and the US to stop sheltering
  activists subject to arrest warrants in Hong Kong. “Relevant countries need to
  respect China’s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong, stop lending
  support for anti-China elements destabilising Hong Kong, and stop providing a
  safe haven for fugitives,” she said.
