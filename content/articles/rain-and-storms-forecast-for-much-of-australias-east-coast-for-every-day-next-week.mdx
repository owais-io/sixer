  For Australia’s east coast, the wet weeks are dragging on with no immediate
  reprieve in sight. “I know people in Sydney and other parts of New South Wales
  will be sick of hearing this,” the Bureau of Meteorology’s Angus Hines told
  the ABC on Saturday. “But it will be another wet week across the eastern
  coastline, all the way from the Illawarra through New South Wales, through
  Sydney, Newcastle, through Brisbane up to the Wide Bay in Queensland”. The
  senior BoM meteorologist said “a couple of wet days” were forecast across
  eastern regions. “Tuesday through Thursday is when we’re eyeing up some
  persistent showers and and possible storms.” Hines said that there would be
  “slightly cool, slightly showery, maybe hail-like weather” over the weekend
  along the east coast. Sign up: AU Breaking News email On the other side of the
  country, he said there was yet another cold front, with strong winds and rain
  expected to arrive in Perth around about Tuesday. Weatherzone meteorologist
  Ben Domensino said there was potential for hazardous and severe weather along
  the east coast next week, though there was some “forecast uncertainty”
  surrounding the weather system. “The pool of cold air associated with next
  week’s wet weather will cause rain, hail and snow to spread over parts of
  south-eastern Australia on Friday and over the weekend. This wintry mix of
  precipitation will then become more focused on NSW and Queensland from Monday
  onwards,” he said. “It’s important to point out that there is currently quite
  a lot of disagreement between computer models regarding where and how much
  rain will fall next week. However, there is general consensus between major
  models that rain will occur over parts of eastern Australia every day next
  week. “Some models also suggest that heavy rain will occur on several days
  next week, possibly enough to cause flooding.”
