  My friend and colleague, Bob Owston, who has died aged 88, was an engineer; he
  was also employed as a project architect, in particular on works at York
  University. He was the structural engineer, working with the architect Jack
  Speight, on the brutalist York Central Hall, built in the mid-1960s and now
  listed Grade II. Also at York, Bob contributed an elegant Corten steel
  footbridge, several halls of residence, language and psychology blocks and the
  Sally Baldwin building. Elsewhere, he was responsible for the pier approach
  building in Bournemouth, evocative of seaside culture. Born in Great Ayton
  near Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire, Bob was the son of Henry, a steelworks
  manager, and Dorothy (nee Prosser). He was evacuated with his mother and elder
  brother, John, to the Lake District during the second world war. His father
  had a motorbike accident and died when Bob was eight. The family moved to
  Glasgow, where his mother found work at the Harland &amp; Wolff shipbuilding
  company. A family friend paid for the boys to board at Ashville college,
  Harrogate. Bob studied civil engineering at Strathclyde University, graduating
  in 1960, then worked in London at Ove Arup &amp; Partners. An MSc followed at
  Northwestern University in Chicago, where Bob nurtured his love of jazz and
  blues music, returning with a Gibson acoustic guitar. In the 1960s he went as
  an engineer to Robert Matthew Johnson Marshall &amp; Partners (RMJM), where my
  father, the architect Sir Andrew Derbyshire, was the partner responsible for
  designing the new University of York. Andrew supported Bob’s determination to
  migrate from engineering to architecture, and he passed the RIBA part III
  examination and interview. He and I became friends, sharing evenings listening
  to blues records when he moved to join RMJM’s Cambridge studio, and I was at
  the university doing my master’s. Later in life, we shared holidays with our
  respective families. Bob was made redundant at RMJM during the 80s recession
  and came to work with me as an associate and team leader at HTA Architects. He
  contributed some wonderfully original yet entirely practical buildings: a
  tower block renovation at Nightingale Heights in Greenwich that won a Housing
  Design award stands out, as do two richly inventive community centres, at
  Waltham Forest housing action trust and Central Oakridge regeneration in
  Basingstoke. Bob also had a passion for designing, building and flying model
  aeroplanes, which led on to model gliders. He is survived by his second wife,
  Jane Steele, whom he married in 1997, and their daughter, Phoebe; his
  daughters, Sophie and Jo, from his first marriage, to Katy (nee Stenhouse),
  which ended in divorce; and by five grandchildren, Otama, Evie, Manu, Poppy
  and Seb.
