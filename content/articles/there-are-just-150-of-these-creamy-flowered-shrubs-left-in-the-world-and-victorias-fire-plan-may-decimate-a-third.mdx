  A mere 150 round-leaf pomaderris are thought left in the world and a planned
  fire break in Victoria could decimate almost 30% of those last remaining
  plants. The critically endangered shrub, which bursts into cascades of creamy
  flowers, is known to exist in only a handful of locations in central
  Victoria’s hill country. Kinglake Friends of the Forest, an environmental
  community group, is threatening legal action against the state government’s
  Forest Fire Management Victoria if it goes ahead with the construction of a
  23km-long, 20-metre-wide fire break – an action identified by the government
  as a key threat to the species. Sue McKinnon, the president of the group, said
  the work should have been referred to the federal government for assessment
  under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. “The law
  is clear,” McKinnon said. “This lovely plant is facing extinction. If it comes
  to the crunch, we will see them in court.” The group surveyed inside the area
  earmarked for the fire break in July and discovered more than 40 of the plants
  growing. McKinnon said the group had been told by a regional fire officer that
  the work was planned for this month. • Sign up to get climate and environment

  government assessment of the species estimated only about 150 mature plants
  remained across 15 populations. The assessment warned most known populations
  were in roadside strips, and these were threatened by “road maintenance works
  and associated fire management and suppression activities including the
  construction and regular slashing of fire breaks.” The planned fire break
  includes a long stretch along a road. Irene Proebsting, the conservation
  coordinator at Latrobe Valley Field Naturalists, said the pomaderris had been
  “pushed to the edge” of existence. “After extensive surveys in the area, it’s
  been found only along roadsides and tracks,” she said. “Now this roadside
  population is to suffer the very treatment that the government defines as a
  threat, despite there being no evidence that these cleared strips will do
  anything to make us safer from fire.” Dr John Patykowski researched the shrub
  a decade ago while at Victoria’s Deakin University. “It’s a beautiful small
  shrub with these clusters of cream-coloured flowers with glossy little leaves.
  The number of individuals left is astoundingly low.” He said the discovery of
  the plants by the Kinglake group represented the species’ most easterly
  population and losing them would “increase extinction risk for this species”.
  “That sounds to me like a population you would want to protect,” he said. “If
  there is clearing directly through that patch of plants, you are forcing them
  into a long-term decline and you’re going to pretty quickly eliminate them
  altogether from that area.” He said in normal circumstances, bushfire would
  help the seeds of the plant stored in the soil to germinate. But if fires came
  along too frequently, plants would be killed without a chance to replenish the
  seed bank. Other threats to the plant include habitat clearing and grazing by
  native wallabies, as well as by introduced species, particularly sambar, an
  introduced deer. As the Kinglake group raises its concerns, a community group
  based in Victoria’s central highlands, Warburton Environment, is this week in
  the federal court arguing the state government’s program of building strategic
  fire breaks is removing old trees containing hollows that are critical habitat
  for threatened species. The Guardian has contacted Victoria’s Department of
  Energy, Environment and Climate Action – which oversees the forest fire
  management agency – for comment but did not hear a response by deadline.
