  The government has taken control of the UK’s third-largest steelworks as
  ministers try to protect 1,450 jobs after Liberty Steel’s operations in South
  Yorkshire were put into administration. The high court in London on Thursday
  ordered the winding up of Speciality Steel UK (SSUK), which has plants in
  Rotherham and Stocksbridge, despite the company’s request for more time to
  find new financial backers. The company, previously part of the metals tycoon
  Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty Steel group, was then put under the control the
  government’s official receiver who appointed special managers from the
  advisory firm Teneo to run it. The judge, Mr Justice Mellor, said there was
  too much uncertainty over whether Gupta could come up with funding. “It is
  quite clear that there are special managers lined up who have the support of
  the government,” he said. “I consider by far the preferable approach is to
  make a winding-up order.” Mellor found the company was “hopelessly insolvent”.
  The company had only £650,000 in the bank after running down its reserves, and
  a wage bill of £3.6m due on Friday. Meanwhile its parent business, Gupta
  Family Group (GFG) Alliance, has 15 companies in insolvency proceedings across
  nine countries. The steelworks and its workers have been described by the
  business minister, Jonathan Reynolds, as important strategic assets for the
  UK. The government has said it had received approaches from “independent third
  parties who have expressed an interest in returning some or all of the sites
  to steelmaking”, according to a letter from the Department for Business and
  Trade entered in court. It also indicated that it hoped for a buyer who would
  restart production at Rotherham, where no products have been made for a year.
  The development marks the second government intervention in the steel industry
  this year after ministers took control of British Steel’s Scunthorpe plant,
  fearing that its Chinese owners would let the blast furnaces cool beyond
  repair. Unions said the government needed to protect the company. Charlotte
  Brumpton-Childs, national officer for the GMB union, said: “This is another
  tragedy for UK steel – and the people of South Yorkshire – this time brought
  on by years of chronic mismanagement by the owners. “But this represents an
  opportunity for the UK government to take decisive action, as it did with
  British Steel, to protect this vital UK industry.” Indian-born Gupta was once
  known as the “saviour of steel” for his plans to turn around struggling
  operations. From a business founded as a student at the University of
  Cambridge he built up a collection of assets spanning the UK, eastern Europe
  and Australia. However, he had been scrambling to find new financing for his
  businesses since the collapse in 2021 of Greensill Capital, which had lent GFG
  about $4.5bn (£3.3bn). Administrators for Greensill are trying to recover that
  money on behalf of creditors, including those represented by the US lender
  Citibank, who are owed £233m. GFG Alliance has also been under investigation
  by the UK’s Serious Fraud Office since 2021 over allegations of “fraud,
  fraudulent trading and money laundering in relation to the financing and
  conduct of the business”, including in relation to Greensill. GFG and Gupta
  deny any wrongdoing. Gupta, who is based in the United Arab Emirates, had
  already lost control of businesses in the UK, Europe, Singapore and Australia.
  However, SSUK is his key metals asset in the UK, where he also bought two
  large country estates. Jeffrey Kabel, Liberty Steel’s chief transformation
  officer, said Gupta was in Sydney, managing GFG’s remaining Australian
  business. He said the case had left Gupta “sad, because he’s put a lot into
  this”. Outside the courtroom after the judgment Kabel said he was “extremely
  disappointed”, adding: “We are by far the best company to run this business.
  We’ve run this company for 10 years. We’ve put a lot of blood, sweat, huge
  amount of money into it.” Kabel said Liberty would continue to operate the
  rest of its UK businesses, including a plate mill and aluminium smelter in
  Scotland, plus a pipe mill in Hartlepool. The special managers will seek to
  keep the business operating, with temporary government funding, before trying
  to find a buyer which will cover those costs. Kabel raised the prospect of
  Gupta trying to mount a bid to buy back the business from the special
  managers, although it was unclear whether he would be able to secure
  financing. Gupta’s lawyers had pushed for him to be allowed another month to
  try to pursue a “pre-pack” administration of the business, which would have
  enabled him to buy it out of insolvency while reducing its debts. The pre-pack
  administration was prepared by the insolvency consultancy Begbies Traynor and
  would have been funded by BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager. A
  government spokesperson said: “We know this will be a deeply worrying time for
  staff and their families, but we remain committed to a bright and sustainable
  future for steelmaking and steelmaking jobs in the UK. “It is now for the
  independent official receiver to carry out their duties as liquidator,
  including ensuring employees are paid, while we also make sure staff and local
  communities are supported.” • This article was amended on 22 August 2025. An
  earlier version said Citibank was owed £233m after the collapse of Greensill
  Capital; however, Citibank is representing creditors owed that money.
