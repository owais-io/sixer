  Road closures, evacuations, travel chaos and stern warnings from officials
  have become fixtures of Canada’s wildfire season. But as the country goes
  through its second-worst burn on record, the blazes come with a twist: few are
  coming from the western provinces, the traditional centre of destruction.
  Instead, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie
  provinces and the Atlantic region, with bone-dry conditions upending how
  Canada responds to a threat that is only likely to grow as the climate warms.
  Experts say the shift serves as a stark reminder that the risk of disaster is
  present across the thickly forested nation. In recent weeks, tens of thousands
  of people have been evacuated from their homes due to the wildfires.
  Saskatchewan and Manitoba have been the worst hit, covering more than 60% of
  the area burned in Canada. But the fires have also seized strained resources
  in Atlantic Canada, where officials in Newfoundland and Labrador are
  struggling to battle out-of-control blazes. In response to the crisis, the
  Newfoundland premier, John Hogan, said on Wednesday morning he would
  temporarily ban off-road vehicles in forested areas because the province
  “simply cannot afford any further risks, given the number of out-of-control
  wildfires we have”. The ban follows a similar move by Nova Scotia, where a
  15-hectare (37-acre) out-of-control fire is burning outside the provincial
  capital, Halifax. In addition to barring vehicles in wooded areas, Nova Scotia
  officials so shut down hiking, camping and fishing in forests, a decision
  reflecting the troubling fact that nearly all fires in the province are
  started by humans. “Conditions are really dry, there’s no rain in sight, the
  risk is extremely high in Nova Scotia,” the province’s premier, Tim Houston,
  told reporters. “I’m happy to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to
  protect people, to protect property and try to just get through this fire
  season and really just pray for rain.” Fires have even erupted in Ontario’s
  Kawartha Lakes region, a collection of rural communities less than 100 miles
  (160km) north of Toronto that are a popular summer destination for residents
  of Canada’s largest city. For a country of sprawling landmass, fires have long
  been a common feature of the hot spring, summer and autumn. But for the last
  century, a mix of geography, climate and industry meant that the biggest and
  hottest fires – and the vast majority of destruction – have been concentrated
  in Canada’s western provinces. That changed in 2023 when Canada had its worst
  fire season on record and the thick haze of smoke blanketed the US. “We had
  fire everywhere. We had evacuations everywhere. We had smoke at a scale that
  was remarkable,” said Paul Kovacs, the executive director of the Institute for
  Catastrophic Loss Reduction at Western University. “And so for the first time,
  we had a different thought about wildfires as a country. With all of the
  smoke, it became a global conversation. This year is repeating all of that.
  This is a national issue. This can show up anywhere.” Kovacs, whose
  organisation focuses largely on preventing structural loss, said more
  buildings had been destroyed this year compared with 2023, and he warned that
  a majority of the residents of the most fire-prone parts of the country, such
  as British Columbia and Alberta, had not yet taken steps to protect or
  “harden” their homes from fire risk. He hopes that a broader national
  recognition of fire risk spurs people in other parts of the country to
  reassess how vulnerable their home or business might be to a fast-moving
  blaze. “That’s the behavioural change we’re hoping to see next, because there
  will be many years of fires to come,” he said. “The size of the burned area
  will not go back to where things were 25 years ago. This is just our new
  reality and we need to be prepared. We need a change in mindset and a
  recognition that this can, and probably will, happen in so many parts of our
  country.” Already, nearly 7.5m hectares (18.5m acres) have burned across
  Canada in 2025, far above the 10-year average. Despite the national threat,
  there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reducing risk, said Jen Baron, a
  postdoctoral researcher at the University of British Columbia’s Centre for
  Wildfire Coexistence. “British Columbia and Alberta have long been the poster
  children for this wildfire problem for a long time, but other regions are
  beginning to experience some of those same challenges,” she said. “This speaks
  to the pervasiveness of climate change: even if a location was relatively low
  fire risk in the past, with the extended droughts that we’re seeing, that’s no
  longer the case now and into the future. “Even though some parts of the
  country are having a wet year on average, things across the board are still
  warmer and drier than they were in the past.” That uncertainty has prompted a
  multimillion-dollar funding effort from the federal government to study risk
  and adaptation, because “there are very few parts of Canada that would be
  totally protected from wildfire”, Baron said. With an international focus on
  wildfires, experts like Baron hope the recent years of immense blazes and
  choking smoke can spur a response that acknowledges the legacy of forestry
  industry practices, urban encroachment into the wilderness and the Indigenous
  stewardship of forests. “We’re just starting to catch up to the scale of the
  problem,” she said. “Wildfire is a natural ecological process, but it’s become
  increasingly challenging to manage with changing climatic conditions.” The
  concerns in Canada echo those emerging across the Atlantic as southern Europe
  grapples with one of its worst wildfire seasons in two decades. In Spain,
  officials were scrambling on Sunday to contain 20 major wildfires. The prime
  minister, Pedro Sánchez, said during a visit to the north-western region of
  Galicia: “There are still some challenging days ahead and, unfortunately, the
  weather is not on our side.” After fires killed three people and burnt more
  than 115,000 hectares, Sánchez said his government would seek to put forward a
  “national pact” to deal with the climate emergency. “We need to reflect deeply
  on how we can rethink our capabilities, not only in terms of responses but
  also in terms of preventing everything related to the climate emergency,
  whether it be fires, storms, or any other climate-related natural disaster,”
  he said. In Portugal, the area burned by wildfires this year is 17 times
  higher than in 2024, at about 139,000 hectares, according to preliminary
  calculations by the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests.
  Across Europe, countries such as Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Albania have
  requested help from the EU’s firefighting force as exhausted officials battle
  forest fires, fuelled by record-breaking temperatures, dry conditions and
  strong winds. In Canada, Baron said the mild nature of this year’s western
  fire season provided a glimpse into the country’s future. “Instead of one big
  fire year every 15 or 20 years, every year will be big in some part of the
  country,” she said. “We really don’t know exactly how climate change is going
  to continue. It doesn’t drive things in linear ways. And we can’t predict
  where there’s going to be a drought next year. But it will be somewhere.”
