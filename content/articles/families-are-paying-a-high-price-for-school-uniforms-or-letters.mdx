  Your report on parents skipping meals to cover uniform costs struck a familiar
  chord (Parents in England skipping meals to afford school uniforms, survey
  finds, 19 August). In my 20 years of working in the third sector, I helped run
  school uniform reuse schemes that made a real difference to struggling
  families. But too often these efforts were undermined by schools themselves.
  Minor tweaks to logos, ties or blazers – introduced every year or two – meant
  perfectly good clothing could no longer be reused. It is a practice that
  benefits suppliers, not children, and it leaves parents paying the price. If
  uniforms are meant to level the playing field, schools must stop treating them
  as branding exercises. Consistency, not constant change, is what families
  need. Antony David Davies Shrewsbury, Shropshire • The sentiment expressed by
  Lucy Pasha-Robinson is one that is rarely heard in these conformist days, but
  one I agree with (School uniforms were meant to be the great leveller – how
  does a £400 bill do that?, 21 August). School uniform was not universal when I
  was a child nor when my children went to school. As a new teacher in Sheffield
  in the early 1980s, the children did not wear uniforms. Now that it is so
  expensive it seems very unfair. Another problem with uniforms is difficulty
  identifying the owners. There was always confusion over which piece of uniform
  belonged to which child – names sometimes never having been put on or being
  washed out. Imagine having to find the right piece of uniform for the right
  child after a PE lesson with three- and four-year-olds. I am pleased to hear
  that my granddaughter is to start at a school with no uniform. Cath
  Whittingham Brigg, Lincolnshire • Perhaps the answer to spiralling uniform
  costs, until such time that it is regulated, is for parents to protest by
  buying an alternative uniform for their children – much like the “dresses for
  boys” protests that pop up perennially in hot weather. If every parent were to
  participate in this, the school could hardly exclude all the children! Plus it
  would teach children a valuable lesson in the power of collective, peaceful
  protest. William Bartram Hampton, London • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
