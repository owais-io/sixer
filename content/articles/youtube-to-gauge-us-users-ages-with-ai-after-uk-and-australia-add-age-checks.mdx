  YouTube announced on Tuesday that it will begin to use artificial intelligence
  to estimate the ages of users in the US, in order to show them age-appropriate
  content. The rollout of the new feature comes one day after Australia’s
  government announced it would ban children under 16 from using YouTube and
  less than a week after the UK implemented sweeping age checks on content on
  social networks. YouTube’s AI age verification on its home turf indicates it
  is putting into place a form of compliance with the Australian and UK
  requirements, despite its persistent opposition to age-check requirements.
  “Over the next few weeks, we’ll begin to roll out machine learning to a small
  set of users in the US to estimate their age, so that teens are treated as
  teens and adults as adults,” wrote James Beser, director of product management
  for YouTube Youth, in a blogpost titled Extending our built-in protections to
  more teens on YouTube. YouTube was promised an exemption from Australia’s
  social media ban last year by the then communications minister, but the
  Australian government said on Monday that the platform would, in fact, be
  included in the country’s ban on children under 16 using social networks. The
  ban is slated to take effect in December. Google, YouTube’s parent company,
  strenuously advocated against the Australian ban and has threatened to sue to
  overturn it. On 25 July, the UK’s long-awaited Online Safety Act took effect.
  The law requires social media and other internet platforms to implement safety
  measures protecting children – preventing them from accessing pornography or
  content that promotes dangerous behavior – or face large fines. By testing the
  new AI tool in the US – the platform’s second largest market after India –
  YouTube is following the example of other tech companies, which have in some
  cases followed tightened privacy regulations in the past by implementing
  stricter mandates for all their users. In the US, California often functions
  as a de facto tech regulator, both by virtue of playing host to many of
  Silicon Valley’s biggest players and by passing stricter regulations than
  other states. Like Australia and the UK, some states in the US have passed age
  verification laws targeting social media sites, though these have not been
  interpreted as applying to YouTube. When YouTube determines a user is teen or
  pre-teen, the site will disable personalized advertising, activate digital
  wellbeing features and put stricter content filters as well as behavioral
  restrictions into place. YouTube’s AI will assess a user’s age via multiple
  behavioral factors, including what kind of videos the user searches for, the
  categories of videos they watch, and how long the account has been active, per
  its blogpost. “This technology will allow us to infer a user’s age and then
  use that signal, regardless of the birthday in the account, to deliver our
  age-appropriate product experiences and protections,” Beser wrote, adding that
  the company had used the technology in other markets before introducing it in
  the US. If the AI’s estimation is incorrect, YouTube says it will allow a user
  to verify their age with a credit card, a government ID or a selfie. How the
  Australian government will ensure that under-16s stay away from the world’s
  largest video site, one of the internet’s primary destinations for both
  children and adults, remains an open question. In June, a test of the
  technology meant to estimate Australian users’ ages was “not guaranteed to be
  effective”.
