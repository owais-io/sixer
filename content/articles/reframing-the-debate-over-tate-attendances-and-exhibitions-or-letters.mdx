  Tate Britain’s visitor numbers continue to rise year on year, and Tate Modern
  is the most visited museum of modern art in the world. Over 6 million people
  visited a Tate gallery in 2024. Your report (Tate director blames Brexit and
  Covid for slump in visitors, 29 July) compares our latest attendance figures
  for Tate Modern and Tate Britain against the most visited year in their
  history, 2019, when they had 700,000 more visitors than the year before. It
  would be fairer to compare with an average of annual attendances before Covid.
  As your article notes, the number of UK visitors to Tate’s galleries has
  returned to 95% of pre-pandemic levels. Attendances at paid-for exhibitions at
  both Tate Modern and Tate Britain are also back up to pre-Covid levels. Almost
  all of the remaining shortfall is in international tourists’ visits to the
  free collections. However, a further 1 million people engaged with Tate works
  in exhibitions worldwide. While demographic changes in European visitation
  have had an impact, our success with local audiences, the achievement that
  your article notes of 76,000 visitors to Tate Modern’s Birthday Weekend (70%
  of whom were under 35), and our upcoming programme of Pablo Picasso, JMW
  Turner, John Constable and Tracey Emin, have given us a stronger platform than
  ever for future growth. Maria Balshaw Director, Tate • I would have to agree
  with those who blame Tate’s woes on things other than Brexit and Covid. Since
  the heady years of the noughties and teens, it seems that the Tate has failed
  to really capture the imagination with its exhibitions offer. Where are the
  shows of the magnitude of Cruel Tender that shed new light on what a
  photograph could be and do? Nor has there been anything to match the gutsiness
  of the Mona Hatoum retrospective, the delight of Christian Marclay’s The
  Clock, the immersiveness of Olafur Eliasson’s The Weather Project or the
  political cogency of Ai Weiwei’s Sunflower Seeds. Apart from the Lynette
  Yiadom-Boakye portrait show at Tate Britain and the El Anatsui pieces in the
  Turbine Hall, there has been little, in terms of contemporary art, to set the
  pulse racing of late. It doesn’t help that the Turner prize – once a focus of
  national conversation – is now so low-key as to barely warrant a mention in
  the press. Maybe contemporary art has run out of energy, but surely in the
  current era we need a vibrant art and public gallery scene to engage us in
  discussion of pressing issues. Catherine Bliss Tonbridge, Kent • Have an
  opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your
  letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section.
