  Hawke PM: The Making of a Legend by David Day Biography, HarperCollins, $49.99
  Part two of David Day’s biography of Bob Hawke, chronicling his years as
  Labor’s longest-serving prime minister, is no less forensic and revealing than
  the first instalment which traced him from birth to the precipice of the top
  job. Hawke, given all the reform that he and his long-serving (and -suffering)
  treasurer Paul Keating oversaw is rightly remembered as a “great” prime
  minister – a “legend”, as Day puts it. He quit the grog. And apparently gave
  up the women. But Day reveals a PM beset by familial turmoil while presenting
  a newly curated public persona. This is a must if you read the compelling
  first volume. – Paul Daley The Last Days of Zane Grey by Vicki Hastrich
  Nonfiction, Allen &amp; Unwin, $34.99 Shark. Camera. Action! Decades before
  the fin‑flashing brilliance of Jaws, pulp novelist Zane Grey sailed into
  Australia chasing a great white for his ill‑fated 1936 film White Death. In
  The Last Days of Zane Grey, the acclaimed nature writer Vicki Hastrich charts
  the arc of that quest – the role Australia played in Grey’s restless final
  chapter, and the unlikely mark he left on the national imagination. This
  swashbuckling tale has it all: encrypted letters, love quadrangles,
  high‑society hi-jinks, very big fish, cinematic fiascos and a man in a duel
  with death itself. Proof that sometimes the wildest thing in the water is the
  human ego. – Beejay Silcox The Visitor by Rebecca Starford Fiction, Allen
  &amp; Unwin, $32.99 Rebecca Starford is rapidly becoming one of our most
  gripping writers: first there was Bad Behaviour, her memoir of bullying at an
  elite country boarding school, then her second world war thriller The
  Imitator, about a female MI5 spy tasked with infiltrating a Nazi ring in
  London. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture
  and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Her third book, The Visitor,
  is quieter but just as riveting: Laura, an Australian living in the UK,
  returns home to Brisbane to sell her parents’ house after they mysteriously
  die in the outback. That mystery is part of the appeal but its gothic quality,
  its spooky sense of the uncanny, are what sets The Visitor apart – and the
  ending is a cracker. – Sian Cain My Father Bryce by Adam Courtenay Biography,
  Hachette, $32.99 The late Bryce Courtenay was a mainstay in Australian
  publishing: every 18 months or so he would release a new novel and dads
  everywhere would reliably buy his latest doorstopper about brave young men
  navigating wartime or the winds of history, making him one of the country’s
  bestselling authors. But the version of his life that he shared with the
  public was largely untrue, according to his son Adam, who reveals that his
  father was a fabulist who lied about being an orphan, that he escaped
  orphanages by winning a prestigious scholarship, that his lawyer father had
  fought apartheid in South Africa and that he himself had to flee the country
  due to his activism. This is a truly revelatory biography, unflinching and
  unsentimental, which shows how Bryce became a man who wouldn’t let truth ruin
  a good story. – SC Learned Behaviours by Zeynab Gemieldien Fiction, Ultimo,
  $34.99 Zaid is a prospective barrister who has broken through the glass
  ceiling, as a Muslim man from western Sydney. He’s well-travelled, owns a
  luxury car, and attends swanky soirees with wealthy colleagues. But when he is
  pulled into a murky murder committed by his now-dead best friend, he’s forced
  to reckon with his choices and the way they have shaped his life. Zeynab
  Gamieldien’s second novel is a subtle social commentary about belonging and
  social mobility. Compelling and pacy, it demonstrates an acute awareness of
  experiences of privilege and subordination, without being preachy. – Sarah
  Ayoub Hailstones Fell Without Rain by Natalia Figueroa Barroso Fiction, UQP,
  $34.99 Natalia Figueroa Barroso’s debut follows the unforgettable Graciela: a
  single mother who’s late on rent, struggling to hold her family together and
  hiding a new couch she can’t afford. As her bonds with her daughter, Rita, and
  her Aunt Chula stretch, fray, and threaten to snap, she grasps for connections
  that might still be mended. Moving between Uruguay and western Sydney, this
  bold and compassionate novel celebrates matrilineal connection and cultural
  inheritance with humour and tenderness. – Seren Heyman-Griffiths The Leap by
  Paul Daley Fiction, Summit Books, $34.99 There’s a crime, but it’s not a crime
  novel as such; the pace is thrilling, but it’s not a thriller … as such. Paul
  Daley’s fine literary sensibilities foreground his genre-defying third novel
  about a stranger in a strange land. Ben Fotheringham-Gaskill, a British
  diplomat who has had his fair share of traumatic postings, believes his move
  to Canberra with his family will be a late-career cruise. But when his boss
  sends him to the outback town The Leap, things take a dangerous turn as he
  wrestles with a dilemma involving the possible murder of one of the town’s
  favourite daughters. With echoes of the Kenneth Cook classic Wake in Fright,
  Daley renders the picaresque with precision and humour, steadily building mood
  and menace as Australia’s bloody black/white history comes into play. – Lucy
  Clark Playing Nice Was Getting Me Nowhere by Alex Cothren Short stories, Pink
  Shorts Press, $32.99 Alex Cothren teaches creative writing at Flinders
  University, with a research focus on satire – and his debut collection of
  short stories is so assured, bleak and uncannily prescient that they could
  have been written tomorrow. In one, a headhunter for an Australian football
  league drafts refugees at offshore processing camps to play brutally – often
  murderously (“six points for knocking a bloke unconscious” – for the ultimate
  prize: citizenship). In another, which I read in June as mass protests against
  Immigration and Customs Enforcement were making headlines in the US,
  undocumented migrants in a single file are forced into a small construction
  trailer, which flashes in an “instant e-deportation”, disappearing them for
  ever. But the one that’s stuck with me for the longest is, happily, the
  funniest. It’s called Where’s a Good Place for an Adult to Hide? I won’t tell
  you anything more about it. – Steph Harmon Gone Bush: Easy Campfire Recipes by
  Outback Tom and Steve Forrest Cookbook, Pantera Press, $36.99 The internet’s
  favourite grandson-grandfather duo have arrived in paperback form to share
  their tasty and easy-to-follow collection of bush-style recipes. Good food is
  simple food (most of the time), says Outback Tom, a Yorta Yorta man who grew
  up in the east Kimberley region of Western Australia. It is there we learn how
  to cook Australian staples including damper, spring rolls and loaded snags.
  Outback Tom and Grandad also share tips on the logistics of cooking in the
  bush. Learn how to make a bush stove and what native ingredients to keep an
  eye out for, courtesy of the duo’s wealth of experience living off the land.
  Make sure this is in your bag on your next adventure. – Isabella Lee Bomb
  Season in Jakarta by Grant Dooley Nonfiction, Simon &amp; Schuster, $36.99
  Grant Dooley and his wife, Kristan, had a ringside seat to a tumultuous time
  in Australia’s most populous neighbour, Indonesia. Both were stationed in
  Jakarta as diplomats during a period of frequent terrorist activity, including
  the 2004 bombing of the Australian embassy, which killed 11 people and injured
  200; the Dooleys were in the building at the time. Dooley’s workmanlike memoir
  of this early 2000s period reads as a journal of the daily life and career
  ambitions of a bureaucrat abroad. It is an insightful glimpse into the
  thoughts and experiences of the Australians who represent the rest of us to
  the world. – Celina Ribeiro Conspiracy Nation by Ariel Bogle and Cam Wilson
  Nonfiction, Ultimo, $36.99 Guardian Australia’s Ariel Bogle and Crikey’s Cam
  Wilson have spent years reporting on the follies and foibles of the internet.
  In that time both have witnessed first-hand the increasingly siloed – and
  increasingly dangerous – tenor of online life. “We’ve watched closely as
  once-fringe ideas and the language of conspiracy have become part of [the]
  Australian public,” the pair write in the introduction to their new book: a
  series of investigations into the rhizomatic subcultures and panics buried
  just beneath the nation’s psyche, from Port Arthur “truthers” to Pete Evans. –

  author published in Australia; Alejandra Martinez’ Salsa in the Suburbs was
