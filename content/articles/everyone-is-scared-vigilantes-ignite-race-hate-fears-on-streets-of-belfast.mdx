  Each evening after sunset the vigilantes gather near CS Lewis Square to rove
  the streets with a sense of swagger and a grandiose title: Belfast Nightwatch
  First Division. The group, typically numbering a dozen members, seeks out
  dark-skinned males and challenges them to produce identity documents and
  explanations for their presence in the east of the city. “Hey boy, I don’t
  want to catch you around our parks any more,” one member recently told a black
  man sitting on a riverside bench. Unsatisfactory responses elicit warnings to
  leave Belfast or face consequences. Some interrogations are filmed and
  uploaded to social media, often with a rap or rock music soundtrack, and
  greeted with praise by followers. It is the latest front in a campaign of
  intimidation against immigrants, refugees and people of colour that has driven
  families from homes and prompted many to consider leaving Northern Ireland.
  “It’s worse than ever now. Everyone is scared,” said Mohammed Idris, 51, a
  Sudanese refugee who lost his shop to a riot last year. “You don’t know
  exactly what will happen the next day. I don’t think I see a future here.”
  Another shopkeeper, who gave his name only as Mo, said racist abuse had become
  normalised. “A few days ago a guy came up to me and said: ‘Get the fuck back
  to your country.’ He insulted everyone on the street and slapped a guy.”
  Anti-immigrant riots in England last August inspired copycat eruptions in
  Belfast and further emboldened a campaign of thuggery that has spread across
  Northern Ireland in recent years. Families from Africa – many employed in
  healthcare – have had windows smashed and cars burned in towns across County
  Antrim. In June mobs targeted the homes of Roma people in Ballymena, forcing
  hundreds to flee. This week youths in the Donegall Pass area of south Belfast
  threw bottles, cans and water balloons at members of ethnic minorities and
  other targets. The most high-profile threat, for now, is in the loyalist,
  Protestant part of east Belfast where vigilantes rove the Newtownards Road and
  nearby areas to confront foreign-looking men. Or, as their Facebook page puts
  it: “Concerned parents … working together, patrolling Belfast streets, for the
  safety and protection of our children and vulnerable people.” It is an
  Orwellian claim. Almost half of those who were arrested for race hate disorder
  in Belfast last summer had previously been reported to police for domestic
  abuse. Misinformation driven by social media depicts immigrants as predators
  who lurk around playgrounds, surveil women and creep around estates trying
  door handles. “You try to build trust in the community but you find that after
  years you’re still a stranger,” said Idris. He has opened a new shop to
  replace the destroyed one but is considering leaving Northern Ireland. So are
  Mohammed, Sherif and Adel, software engineers from Egypt who moved to Belfast
  with their wives and children several years ago to work in the city’s booming
  tech sector. Intimidation has become more brazen and frequent, they said.
  Since April the three men have experienced the same phenomenon: a small group
  of people approach them in a public space, usually a street or park, and film
  and follow them. If the engineers retreat to their cars the pursuers –
  sometimes shouting insults, sometimes silent – film and photograph their
  numberplates. “Each time we report it to the police because maybe these people
  will make up stories about us and say we were doing something wrong,” said
  Sherif. “We’ve stopped going out after 9pm. We used to feel that Northern
  Ireland was home but these days, no longer. Feeling safe is the most important
  thing. If you don’t feel safe, you don’t stay.” All three said they planned to
  return to Egypt. Kashif Akram, a board member of the Belfast Islamic Centre,
  which was attacked in June, said immigrants were being scapegoated for
  economic and social problems. “This all stems from one thing, which is hate.”
  Akram said politicians who condemn race attacks while citing housing shortages
  were sending mixed signals. “The two issues are separate.” He hopes a race and
  ethnicity action plan launched by the police will help to punish and deter
  aggression. Police monitor the vigilantes and officers arrested a 37-year-old
  on suspicion of assault, theft and causing criminal damage. A vigil by his
  supporters was addressed by a self-styled citizen journalist with armed
  robbery convictions, the Belfast Telegraph reported. The vigilantes have
  divided opinion in east Belfast. Some residents expressed shame. “It’s
  horrendous. Pure racism,” said a 34-year-old woman who withheld her name.
  “That these guys are claiming to protect women is beyond ironic.” The owner of
  a shop that sells loyalist bunting, in contrast, endorsed the nocturnal
  patrols. “They’re not vigilantes, they’re protectors of the community. They’re
  trying to keep people safe. One of them has a walking frame – how can he be a
  vigilante?” Rosemary Jenkinson, a writer who lives in the area, said
  foreigners were still settling in east Belfast and noted that last month
  dozens of immigrants attended a loyalist bonfire that celebrated Protestant
  culture. “It’s a positive sign.” Sidharth Sreekumar, a 32-year-old civil
  servant of Indian heritage, said he enjoys living in east Belfast, though he
  acknowledged he had two advantages. “I’m English and I’m 6ft 3in. I think
  people would think twice about messing with me.”
