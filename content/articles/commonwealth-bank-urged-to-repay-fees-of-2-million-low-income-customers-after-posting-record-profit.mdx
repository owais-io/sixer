  The Commonwealth bank has posted a record cash profit, sparking renewed calls
  for Australia’s biggest bank to repay more than 2 million low-income customers
  $270m in fees – something it has refused to do. CBA recorded $10.25bn in
  annual cash profits for the year to June – a 4% lift on the previous year –
  and gave a bumper $2.60 payout per share to shareholders. The bank announced
  the results in its 2025 annual report on Wednesday alongside its updated
  environment and social policies, where it also revealed it would impose
  further climate requirements on coal mining clients. Thermal coalminers will
  not be permitted to borrow from the bank unless they are aiming to reach net
  zero emissions by 2050, with CBA imposing further decarbonisation and
  transparency requirements. Sign up: AU Breaking News email About $1.2bn of CBA
  finance was exposed to the thermal coal industry at the end of June. CBA has
  imposed energy transition plan requirements on oil and gas companies and
  producers of the other main black coal product, metallurgical coal, since
  2023. Heightened requirements for lending would make it much harder for coal
  companies to borrow from the bank, according to Morgan Pickett, an analyst at
  climate advocacy group Market Forces. “Australia’s biggest bank has officially
  ended any new finance for coal, whether for power or making steel, unless it’s
  proven to be compatible with a safe and livable climate,” Pickett said. The
  profit announcement also amplified calls for CBA to repay more than 2 million
  low-income customers after charging them fees, something it declined to do in
  July. A petition from consumer advocacy group Choice demanding repayment has
  attracted over 20,000 signatures. “These are some of the most financially
  vulnerable people and the least able to afford to line the bank’s pockets,”
  Choice’s Andy Kelly said. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission
  in 2024 found four banks had charged high fees to people entitled to low-fee
  accounts. Commonwealth Bank made goodwill payments of $25m to nearly 90,000
  customers, while ANZ, Bendigo Bank and Westpac also paid $8m to over 55,000
  customers. In July, ASIC announced those three banks would make additional
  refunds. However, CBA told the corporate regulator it would not, despite
  charging $270m in fees to a further 2.2 million low-income customers from 2019
  to 2024. A CBA spokesperson said at the time the fees had been disclosed to
  the customers, who benefited from the flexibility of high-fee accounts and had
  a range of income and wealth levels. The report also showed Australian
  households took out an additional $34bn in home loans, up 7% from June 2024 to
  June 2025. Personal loans also picked up by $400m and business lending rose
  $16bn over the year. The share of customers who were 90 or more days behind on
  home loan payments steadied at 0.7% in June, which helped cut CBA’s losses on
  impaired or unpaid loans by a tenth, to $726m annually. More customers are
  ahead on their minimum monthly loan repayments, with the share rising to 85%
  in June compared with just under 80% the previous year. “Pleasingly, many
  households have seen a rise in disposable incomes due to the recent relief
  from reduced interest rates, lower inflation and tax cuts,” CBA’s chief
  executive, Matt Comyn, said. Households deposited an additional $34bn in CBA
  accounts over the year to June.Household and business customers saw the gap
  between loans and deposits narrow over the year, by 0.03 and 0.04 percentage
  points respectively, even though CBA’s overall net interest margin widened,
  helping it achieve record profit. Alan Docherty, CBA’s chief financial
  officer, said increased competition from other banks had forced CBA to offer
  lower mortgage interest rates and higher savings rates. The bank gave
  shareholders a dividend payout of $2.60 a share, to a total of $4.85 over the
  last 12 months, up from the $4.65 it paid in 2024, which will be paid to more
  than 800,000 direct shareholders. Investors sold out of the bank after results
  were published, sending the price falling from nearly $178 to $169 by
  Wednesday afternoon, the stock’s biggest one-day fall since markets panicked
  in August 2024.
