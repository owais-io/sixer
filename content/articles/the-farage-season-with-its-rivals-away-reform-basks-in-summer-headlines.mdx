  Nigel Farage is far less bothered than many politicians about taking his own
  trips abroad while parliament is sitting. Refreshed and relaxed, he can then
  spend the summer recess in Westminster, dominating the scene while his
  opponents are on their sunloungers and the news agenda is light. The Reform UK
  leader has been at the helm of five press conferences, one every week of
  recess, and has just managed two more in the final week. Most of them have
  been on Mondays, with announcements on migration and crime trailed into the
  weekend papers and his live appearances on news channels sometimes lasting
  longer than an hour. Those Monday conferences have prompted debates and
  backlash which run for days. Each week there has been a raft of defections,
  from a police and crime commissioner, former MPs and on Wednesday Reform UK’s
  first MSP. He has featured on at least 22 front pages. Farage speaks
  off-script, dismissing the questions he cannot answer, but taking dozens.
  Unlike a government press conference, he luxuriates in the time he has
  available, with long rambling answers which contain a multitude of half-truths
  and pet theories that could be turned into news stories. And – some would say
  even commendably – he takes questions from every journalist present, even
  magazine writers and podcasters who have sometimes seemed caught off guard by
  having their name called by Farage from the podium when they had attended
  primarily to record the atmosphere. Each event has led to a string of news
  stories, from demands for the release of details of criminal suspects’
  ethnicity and migration status to the proliferation of flags. And then there
  was his final major intervention of recess: an extensive plan for mass
  deportations. At that launch, he took dozens of questions again, brushing
  aside any scrutiny on detail. It might be a sad indictment of our politics,
  but tripping up on practicalities does not yet seem to be the way he might
  eventually come a cropper. Farage can be brazen where another politician would
  simply look shifty. There is also an unspoken element to these staged events
  and press conferences which is impressing the Westminster pack: just how much
  money the party clearly has to be spending on all these summer stunts. A far
  cry from early chaotic press conferences in hired rooms, where Lee Anderson
  positioned himself directly behind a billowing flag, giving the impression of
  a headless speaker. Now in Millbank Tower, the weekly press conference room
  glistens with professional kit. The launch of the deportation plan involved
  the bussing of journalists to an Oxfordshire airport, with towering screens
  and a mock departure board for deportation flights. Gawain Towler, Farage’s
  former director of communications, said the Reform leader’s strategy over the
  summer had been to position himself as a prime minister-in-waiting. “He needs
  to be able to see the whole battlefield and not get bogged down in a single
  skirmish,” he said. “What we are seeing is Farage growing up, quickly.” And
  what of the government? There has been a far from coherent agenda, no press
  conferences from cabinet ministers or any major policy developments, some
  updates on plans for reforms of asylum appeals or the operational status of
  the agreement with the French to return some of the arrivals from small boats.
  A smattering of press releases on planning and environmental changes have not
  troubled many newspaper front pages. Starmer’s single opportunity to steal
  back the spotlight came yet again on the international stage, as he joined
  European leaders in Washington as support for Ukraine’s President Zelenskyy.
  Faced with the Farage barrage, there is a wall of silence. No cabinet minister
  is taking the role of attack dog. Starmer took this approach in the election
  campaign when it came to the Tory offensive: that he should never be pulled on
  to his opponent’s territory. Those close to the prime minister expect him
  eventually to respond but on his own terms, using the language of Labour
  values, when parliament returns. But as Reform UK’s poll lead holds firm and
  immigration begins to outpace even the economy and health as the top concern
  of voters, No 10 might come to regret that it allowed Farage the space to make
  the summer entirely his own.
