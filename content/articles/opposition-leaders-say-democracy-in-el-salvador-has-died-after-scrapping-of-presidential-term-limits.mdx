  Activists and opposition leaders have warned that El Salvador is following
  Venezuela’s path towards dictatorship after the Central American country’s
  congress scrapped presidential term limits, paving the way for Nayib Bukele to
  seek indefinite re-election. “Democracy in El Salvador has died,” opposition
  congresswoman Marcela Villatoro declared late on Thursday as the legislature –
  in which Bukele’s Nuevas Ideas party controls 90% of seats – approved the
  highly controversial constitutional reform, by 57 votes to three. Villatoro
  accused fellow lawmakers of dealing a “death blow” to the country’s democratic
  system during the late-night session. “Today some people applaud this.
  Tomorrow they will regret it,” she said, comparing El Salvador’s slide into
  authoritarianism to the collapse of Venezuela’s democracy. “When all the
  orders come from one person and everything revolves around one single person,
  democracy no longer exists. And when you lose democracy … it takes years to
  get it back,” Villatoro warned. Loyalists of Bukele – a social media-savvy
  44-year-old who once called himself “the world’s coolest dictator” –
  celebrated the reforms, which will also see presidential terms extended from
  five years to six and bring the presidential election scheduled for 2029
  forward to 2027. The election’s second round will also be scrapped. Suecy
  Callejas, one of 54 Nuevas Ideas lawmakers in El Salvador’s 60-seat assembly,
  tweeted: “The constitution isn’t untouchable. What should be untouchable is
  the WILL of the people. And today, more than ever, the people are at the
  centre of our decisions.” Bukele, who is one of Donald Trump’s top Latin
  American allies, was first elected in 2019 and was re-elected last year thanks
  to widespread public support for his hardline crackdown on gangs, which has
  seen homicide rates plummet. That three-year clampdown has seen 2% of El
  Salvador’s adult population jailed and due process suspended, and made Bukele
  a role model for rightwing Latin American politicians grappling with high
  crime rates, and for members of Trump’s Maga movement. But Bukele’s
  concentration of power has horrified opposition politicians and activists.
  Juanita Goebertus, Human Rights Watch’s Americas director, compared El
  Salvador’s scrapping of presidential term limits to Venezuela’s 2009
  referendum, which approved the same measure under its then populist president
  Hugo Chávez. Sixteen years later, Chávez’s heir, Nicolás Maduro, remains in
  power, having claimed a third term last year despite apparently losing the
  July 2024 election. “[El Salvador is] traveling down the same path as
  Venezuela,” Goebertus warned. “It starts with a leader who uses his popularity
  to concentrate power, and it ends in dictatorship.” In a rare interview with
  the foreign media last year, Bukele said he would not seek re-election, citing
  the constitutional “prohibition” which was this week removed. “Also, we have
  an agreement with my wife that this is my last term,” Bukele told Time
  magazine, musing that he might write a book after leaving power. Few believe
  Bukele will honour that pledge. “Welcome to the club of the authoritarian
  dictatorships of Maduro, [Daniel] Ortega, [Miguel] Díaz Canel,” tweeted Carlos
  Fernando Chamorro, a prominent Nicaraguan journalist forced into exile because
  of his country’s democratic decline.
