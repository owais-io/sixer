  This year, A-level results in England reached a record high outside the
  pandemic era, However, the stark regional divide between London and the rest
  of the UK, particularly the north-east and East Midlands, has widened. But why
  are London schools outperforming all other regions? Here are some reasons: The
  London Challenge In 2003, the Blair government launched an initiative to
  transform schools in the capital. At the time, London schools were perceived
  to be some of the worst in the country. At its peak, the London Challenge had
  a budget of £40m a year, working with local authorities, investing in school
  leadership, building new secondary schools and sixth forms, as well as
  radically expanding the academisation of new and existing schools. There was
  also an incentive to build extended schools that offered services to students
  and their families outside the classroom. As a result, 30% of London schools
  were graded as outstanding in 2010 by Ofsted, compared with 17.5% nationally.
  Although the Schools Challenge was later stretched to Greater Manchester and
  the Black Country, London is considered to be the success story. Teachers Due
  to higher pay and cultural attractiveness, teachers are more inclined to train
  and work in the capital, therefore a higher level of teaching is arguably
  available to London students. The Teach First programme was a targeted
  intervention that started in 2002 with the aim of recruiting university
  graduates to train as teachers in challenging schools. The first cohort of
  trainees were placed exclusively in London secondary schools between 2003 and
  2006. Although trainees are distributed across regions, London has the highest
  concentration, with more than a quarter of Teach First schools being in the
  capital in 2019. Gentrification The changing class demographics in London have
  had a noticeable effect on the quality of schools in the city. In the past few
  decades, young families have chosen to remain in there rather than moving to
  suburban areas, as once was the norm. As a result, formerly impoverished
  boroughs such as Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Brixton have become more middle
  class and, over time, schools in the capital have received an increased number
  of pupils from families with higher levels of education, improving the
  schools’ results. Immigration London remains the most ethnically diverse
  region in the country. Research shows that parents from migrant families often
  have higher ambitions of social mobility through educational means, known
  academically as the “London effect”. In 2017, the former education secretary
  Michael Gove said “there’s lots of evidence that London having become more
  diverse has contributed to educational standards rising”. However, research
  from King’s College London shows that, if only white London pupils are
  considered, London still outperforms all other regions in the UK. Range of
  schools London contains a higher concentration of schools within one region.
  This gives families more choice to send their children to schools and sixth
  forms that align with their interests and academic progression. Additionally,
  students are able to commute across the capital, granting the opportunity to
  attend specialist schools that may have otherwise been out of reach.
