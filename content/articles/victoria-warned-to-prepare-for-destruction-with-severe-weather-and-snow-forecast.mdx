  Blizzards have been forecast for parts of Victoria and residents have been
  warned to prepare for power outages and “destruction” as damaging winds are
  expected to lash the south-eastern states into the weekend. An intense cold
  front began moving across Victoria from South Australia on Friday, after rain,
  thunderstorms and destructive winds battered the Adelaide metro area and
  surrounds on Thursday night and Friday morning, and a tornado warning was
  briefly issued. The State Emergency Services chief officer, Tim Wiebusch,
  warned Victorian residents to secure loose items around their homes, to charge
  devices and spare batteries, and for those in heavily treed areas to avoid any
  unnecessary travel. “These wind speeds will bring destruction,” Wiebusch said
  on Friday afternoon. “These wind speeds are likely to impact our power
  systems. So we are alerting all Victorians to make sure that you are prepared
  now. “Expect that there will be power outages. Expect that there will be
  fallen power lines and to stay away from those power lines. Expect without
  power that you’ve already charged your phones and other devices this
  afternoon.” Sign up: AU Breaking News email Those destructive winds, with
  gusts reaching up to 130km/h, were expected to push further into the eastern
  states on Saturday, bringing showers, hail and isolated thunderstorms. “We
  haven’t seen wind like this for some time,” Wiebusch said. “In fact, the wind
  speeds that we’re going to expect we have not seen this year. And in fact,
  this is the weather system we’ve not seen for a couple of years.” Snowfall as
  low as 600-metre elevation was expected in Victoria on Saturday along with
  strong winds. Blizzard conditions were forecast for the alpine areas above
  1,200-metres. Snow showers and possible small hail was forecast for Friday and
  early Saturday morning at Mount Hotham, after a week of severe weather in
  Victoria’s high country that has added complications to the search for
  suspected gunman Dezi Freeman in Porepunkah. Winds of up to 113km/h had
  already been recorded at Mount Hotham on Friday. Vicki Ward, minister for
  emergency services, said the SES had received 76 requests for assistance since
  midday Thursday, and were expecting those numbers to grow. “We’ve already seen
  several serious incidents today, two cars impacted by trees and a person
  impacted by a tree,” Ward said. “We’re asking people to remain vigilant, don’t
  be travelling if you don’t need to be. Clear up around your property, make
  sure there’s no loose items, and if you can remain indoors in safety, that’s
  the best place to be.” Severe weather warnings covered much of South
  Australia, Victoria and parts of Tasmania and New South Wales on Friday.
  Damaging winds were expected as far into NSW as the Snowy Mountains,
  Brindabella Range and parts of the southern and central tablelands on Friday
  afternoon. Risk from damaging winds was expected to peak in Melbourne and
  Geelong early on Saturday morning and were also likely to affect the water,
  with damaging surf possible across western and central waters of Victoria on
  Saturday, and elevated sea levels possible across Port Phillip Bay. A
  hazardous surf warning was possible for NSW for Saturday. Snow was also
  forecast for areas that would not normally see it, including the Flinders
  Rangers and the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia, the Dandenong Ranges,
  Macedon Ranges and the Grampians in Victoria, and the Central Tablelands,
  including Orange, Bathurst and Oberon, in New South Wales. Melbourne was
  expected to reach only 13C on Saturday, as was Hobart. Sydney had a forecast
  top of 17C for Saturday. Adelaide could expect 14C. Canberra was looking at
  13C, showers and patches of morning frost. Rain was also forecast for much of
  the south-east, and minor flood warnings were still current in Tasmania for
  the lower North Esk, South Esk and Meander rivers. “Further minor to moderate
  river rises are possible across parts of Tasmania and through eastern Victoria
  in the coming days, but this risk will be closely assessed over the coming
  day,” Miriam Bradbury, senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said
  on Friday morning. There was a moderate flood warning still in place for the
  Namoi River in northern NSW, but no significant rainfall was expected in that
  area in the coming days. The rest of the country’s capitals were expecting
  much milder weather for Saturday, with Brisbane looking at 21C, Darwin
  expecting 34C, and Perth 20C.
