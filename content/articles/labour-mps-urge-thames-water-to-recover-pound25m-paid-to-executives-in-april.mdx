  Thames Water should claw back £2.5m in bonuses that were paid to executives in
  April, 27 Labour MPs representing constituencies served by the utility have
  urged. The MPs said it was “disgusting” that the company was hiking water
  bills “to pay for executives’ failings when those same executives were
  receiving multimillion-pound bonuses”. In a letter to Thames Water’s director
  of corporate finance, Fred Maroudas, they called for the company to scrap its
  next planned round of bonuses in September and reinvest the money into water
  infrastructure. The letter from 27 Labour MPs in areas served by Thames Water,
  coordinated by Yuan Yang, the MP for Earley and Woodley, set out demands for
  the company, including resolving the most severe cases of pollution and
  failure highlighted by their constituents. It also urged Thames to drop its
  request to Ofwat, the regulator for England and Wales, for leniency over
  sewage fines and to commit to meeting MPs by the end of the year to discuss
  their casework. Yang and two other Labour MPs – Will Stone and Peter Lamb –
  gave Maroudas the letter at a meeting in Reading on Friday morning. Yang said
  after the meeting that the company had agreed to “a scrutiny meeting” with MPs
  in September. A Thames Water spokesperson described the meeting as “very
  constructive”, adding: “No executive directors have received
  performance-related pay this year. A management retention programme was
  established as part of our liquidity extension with the objective of retaining
  senior management during a complex recapitalisation. “We have paused its
  implementation. None of the retention payments have been funded by customers.
  The company’s chief executive is not party to the MRP and has received no
  payments.” Thames Water, which supplies 16 million customers in London and
  south-east England, is scrambling to stabilise its finances and agree a rescue
  plan funded by its creditors to avoid the prospect of temporary
  nationalisation. It posted annual losses of £1.65bn for the year to March,
  while its debt pile climbed to £16.8bn. In May, it was handed a £122.7m fine,
  the biggest ever issued by Ofwat, for breaching rules on sewage spills and
  shareholder payouts. In a statement, Yang said that more than 140 of her
  constituents had complained of unresolved leaks, water problems and spiralling
  bills. Thames customer bills have gone up from £488 to £639 a year. “I see
  Thames Water’s failure reflected in my inbox every day in casework from
  constituents regarding long-lasting disruptive roadworks, untransparent and
  incorrect bills, and leaks that have gone for years without repair,” she said.
  “To add insult to injury, while these outrageous failings persist, customers
  are drowning in increased bills – hiked by an average of 31% for our
  constituents.” Calvin Bailey, the MP for Leyton and Wanstead, said his
  constituents had dealt with repeated sewage overflows near their homes and a
  local nursery and raised concerns about pollution in local rivers. The
  Guardian revealed in July that Thames had already paid bonuses totalling
  £2.46m to 21 managers on 30 April and was refusing to claw the money back.
  Ministers have banned six water companies, including Thames Water, from
  awarding bonuses for this financial year after seven major pollution
  incidents. The ban applies only to the most senior roles including the
  company’s chief executive, the chief financial officer and the chair. Chris
  Weston, the chief executive of Thames Water, voluntarily declined his 300%
  bonus this year. Weston told MPs last month that the company was “extremely
  stressed and operating in very difficult circumstances”. He said that to turn
  things around would take between five and 10 years. The Thames Water
  spokesperson pointed to the company’s “record levels of investment we have
  planned to meet our commitments to customers and the environment” and said it
  was “committed to improving outcomes for the environment and its customers”.
  They added: “In order to be investable, we and prospective investors have
  needed to engage in discussions with our regulators about regulatory
  easements.”
