  While unrest and new vaccine restrictions have kept US health agencies in
  headlines, there’s one vaccine program in particular that Robert F Kennedy Jr,
  secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), recently
  vowed to “fix”, which experts say could further upend the vaccine industry and
  prevent people experiencing rare side effects from vaccines from getting
  financial help. While some changes to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation
  Program (VICP), which compensates people who suffer very rare side effects
  from vaccination, must come from Congress, Kennedy could take several actions
  to reshape or affect the program’s operations. Kennedy “seems to be pursuing
  two opposite theories” on changing VICP, said Anna Kirkland, a professor at
  the University of Michigan and author of Vaccine Court. “Make it easier and
  compensate more, versus blow it all up. And then maybe there’s a third way of,
  foment skepticism, undercut recommendations,” she said. The moves represent
  the latest battle in “the war on vaccines that he’s been waging for decades”,
  Art Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at New York University’s
  Grossman School of Medicine said. Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist for about
  two decades, has reported more than $2.4m in income for referring
  vaccine-related cases to a law firm, for instance. Making major changes to the
  program may open up vaccine makers to more litigation, making it difficult for
  them to keep existing vaccines on the market or to produce new ones. In 1980,
  there were 18 companies in the US producing vaccines; a decade later, there
  were four. Congress passed a law in 1986 leading to the establishment of the
  VICP to prevent further instability in the vaccine market. By making changes
  to the program, Kennedy “can scare the manufacturers”, and the market is
  “pretty fragile”, said Caplan. Dorit Reiss, professor of law at University of
  California College of the Law, San Francisco, said that “VICP was adopted …
  because manufacturers were leaving the market over litigation” and that “this
  would mean manufacturers will pull out of the market and we’ll have less
  vaccine accessible”. There aren’t many vaccine makers left in the US. Most
  vaccines are not very lucrative – either for the manufacturers or the doctors
  who administer them. Most routine vaccines are covered under the VICP. Caplan
  said any vaccines could be vulnerable and these actions have major
  consequences for uptake even if vaccines remain on the market. “The biggest
  problem is still undermining trust in mainstream science,” Caplan said.
  Changing or even eliminating the program would also likely make it more
  difficult for patients to have their cases addressed. Yet a bill that would
  abolish the VICP entirely, introduced by the representative Paul Gosar, a
  Republican from Arizona, is gaining traction in anti-vaccine circles. Reiss
  noted that “undoing VICP might mean there’s no vaccines available”. A website
  about Gosar’s bill features a quote from Kennedy: “If we want safe and
  effective vaccines, we need to end the liability shield.” HHS did not respond
  to the Guardian’s questions on whether Kennedy knows about this use of his
  quotation, or what his plan to “fix” the compensation program involves. There
  are several actions Kennedy can take to “make vaccine availability much more
  difficult”, Caplan said. Kennedy has mentioned two concrete plans: adding
  discovery to existing compensation claims, and removing the backlog of claims.
  The program rules already allow discovery at the discretion of the
  adjudicators, called special masters. Adding special masters could help speed
  up claim processing, but the number of special masters was set by Congress,
  not HHS. In addition, the special masters answer to the US Department of
  Justice (DoJ), not HHS – though they represent the secretary in claims. “The
  first thing [Kennedy] said he was doing was working with Pam Bondi at DoJ,”
  Kirkland said. “Bondi could certainly direct her own employees to stop
  contesting a lot of things, and just let as much as possible go through,
  because they represent the secretary against the petitioners. So they could
  certainly change the softer ways that they operate, try to be easier, try to
  be faster.” In that case, Kennedy could ask the special masters to concede –
  effectively approving automatically – any claims about, for instance,
  diagnoses of autism or allergies after vaccination, Reiss said. One way to
  argue that a vaccine caused severe side effects under VICP is to present in a
  causation hearing a preponderance of evidence demonstrating it’s more than 50%
  likely – a metric known as “50% and a feather” – that the vaccine is the cause
  of a side effect. But “there doesn’t have to be existing literature that shows
  this connection. If you have a credible expert with a convincing theory,
  that’s enough” under VICP, Reiss said. Reiss noted that the “program was
  intentionally and consciously designed to make it easy to compensate”. “It
  increases vaccine trust when we have a quick, generous compensation program –
  when we can tell people: ‘Look, if the worst happens, if you’re the one in the
  million where things actually go wrong, you can be quickly and generously
  compensated, whereas if you instead get a vaccine-preventable disease, you
  don’t have any compensation.’ I think that can help trust. It’s also the right
  thing to do,” she said. The other way to settle a claim is the table of
  injuries, which lists the vaccines included in ACIP [the Advisory Committee on
  Immunization Practices], potential injuries and time periods. “If the injury
  occurs within that time, then causation is presumed,” Reiss said. Kennedy
  could change the table, adding more or different side effects. This would
  require publishing public notice and accepting comments. If a new injury is
  added to the table, cases are allowed to be submitted for the past eight
  years, rather than the usual three years. The table is “the one that’s the
  most straightforwardly under his control”, Kirkland said. The last time a
  government agency tried to change the table, it failed. “That’s got to mean
  something,” she added. If the ACIP no longer recommends a routine vaccine, it
  may be removed from the table. Claims would then need to go through the
  regular court system. There is a higher bar in the regular courts, where
  claimants have to show fault, demonstrating a defective product or negligence,
  for instance. The rules of evidence are stricter. Claimants also have to hire
  a lawyer and pay the lawyer costs and the experts. With the private US
  healthcare market, “if you don’t win your case, you’re going to then get stuck
  with gigantic medical bills”, Caplan said. In a country like the US, where the
  burden is on the individual to pay their medical bills, VICP is a safety net
  for people having medical events after vaccination, he said. Many of the
  claims now handled under VICP are for relatively low amounts of money that law
  firms – especially the rare firms with the expertise to take on large
  pharmaceutical companies – might not find worthwhile in representing. There
  are aspects of VICP that need reform, Reiss said. The program needs more
  special masters, the caps on payments need to be updated from original levels
  set in the 1980s, and the statute of limitations should be expanded beyond
  three years – especially because it is difficult to diagnose side effects in
  young children in that amount of time, she said. “The statute of limitations,
  special masters and caps need to be changed, and there have been efforts to do
  that,” she said. “They just, I think, didn’t get enough attention, and that’s
  probably not what he’s focusing on.”
