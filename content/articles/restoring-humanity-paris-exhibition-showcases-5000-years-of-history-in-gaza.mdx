  An exhibition tracing more than 5,000 years of cultural and archaeological
  history in Gaza has become a summer hit in Paris, as visitors flock to
  discover the heritage of this strip of land along the Mediterranean, whose
  multilayered past has been eclipsed by modern tragedy. While Gaza faces a
  humanitarian catastrophe of starvation and war, the exhibition, Saved
  Treasures of Gaza, at Paris’s Institut du Monde Arabe brings what curators
  called a sense of “urgency” to explain the rich history of a place that has
  been a crossroads of cultures since Neolithic times. For thousands of years,
  Gaza’s location on the eastern Mediterranean made it a prosperous oasis. It
  was a trade hub, intellectual powerhouse and centre of learning, sitting at
  one of the world’s great geographical crossroads between trade routes from
  Asia and Africa. Many cultures and empires left their mark – including
  Philistines, Assyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Persians and Mamluks – as depicted
  by more than 100 intricate objects on display from statuettes, oil lamps and
  ceramics to inscriptions, imported marble and a vast Byzantine floor mosaic.
  “We wanted to give Gaza its history back,” said Élodie Bouffard, the lead
  curator. “It was about restoring the humanity of Gaza and making its long
  history visible again, rather than reducing it to a discourse dominated by
  contemporary history. The focus on contemporary history risks depicting Gaza
  as a zone of tragedy, a bubble where only devastation is possible, when in
  fact there is a long human history in Gaza built upon thousands of years as a
  great centre of connection.” Bouffard said: “Gaza was the most open space in
  the Mediterranean. It was a territory that was extremely rich, that produced a
  lot of food and whose connections to Africa and Asia made it a place of
  festival and celebration that was much talked about and written about, and a
  place that was continually inhabited.” The pieces on show have been largely
  locked away in storage in Switzerland for 17 years: after an exhibition in
  2007 at Geneva’s Museum of Art and History, the works could not be safely
  returned to Gaza because of the security and political situation. “Their exile
  saved them in a sense,” said Bouffard, noting that otherwise they could have
  been lost in the current Israeli bombardment. But she said this also meant the
  pieces had mostly been sadly “hidden and locked away from view” and from
  public understanding. One of the key pieces in the show is a small marble
  statue of a goddess, thought to be either Aphrodite or Hecate, dating from the
  Roman or Hellenic era, who would have once sat in a temple. Bouffard said the
  statue’s fate is symbolic of the layers of history and archaeological
  challenges in Gaza. “She is a masterpiece. She must have disappeared during
  the forced Christianisation of Gaza in AD402-AD405, taken from her alcove in a
  temple. She was maybe thrown into the sea, where she disappeared for 1,500
  years, until a fisher found her off Blakhiya, a neighbourhood that has now
  been destroyed. He chose to give her to a Palestinian collector – so she was
  saved.” Bouffard added: “Then she was brought to Europe, shown in Geneva in
  2007, just as an effort was being made to raise funds to create an
  archaeological museum in Gaza. No museum has been built in Gaza and she has
  never gone home. Hers is a story of many tragic moments of appearing and
  disappearing … She looks at us and is still waiting to return to the place
  where she was created.” The Paris exhibition also traces archaeological
  excavation work in Gaza and the sites of cultural and historical significance
  damaged in military strikes since 2023, including mosques, churches, archives
  and the archaeological site of Anthedon harbour, Gaza’s first known seaport.
  Bouffard said this was not to suggest heritage sites were more important than
  human lives: “Between old stones and humans, it is always humans who are the
  priority.” But she said that learning about thousands of years of history that
  had connected people was a way to bring perspective and potential hope. “If
  history is not spoken about, then the discourse focuses on a feeling there is
  no solution,” she said. Jack Lang, the head of the Institut du Monde Arabe and
  a former French culture minister, said at the exhibition’s opening that he
  hoped the show could “restore some hope in the future of Gaza”. He said:
  “Nothing is worse than abandonment and forgetting.” Saved Treasures of Gaza is
  at the Institut du Monde Arabe, Paris, until 2 November • This article was
  amended on 11 and 12 August 2025 to provide credits on all the photos and an
  explanatory caption on the main image. Also, an earlier version miscaptioned
  the last photograph as being of “the grand mosque”; this has been corrected.
