  Public sector workers have voiced “deep concern” after Coventry city council
  signed a £500,000-a-year artificial intelligence contract with the US data
  technology company Palantir. The deal is the first of its kind between a UK
  local authority and the Denver-based company, which supplies technology to the
  Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and to help Donald Trump’s mass deportation
  efforts. The contract follows a pilot scheme in the council’s children’s
  services department, including using AI for case-note transcription and to
  summarise social workers’ records. The council is planning to extend the
  Palantir system to processes for providing support to children with special
  educational needs. The council’s chief executive, Julie Nugent, said it aimed
  to “improve internal data integration and service delivery” and “explore the
  transformative opportunities of artificial intelligence”. Palantir already has
  a number of public sector contracts in the UK, including providing AI to help
  tackle organised crime in Leicestershire and building the new NHS federated
  data platform. Keir Starmer toured the company’s Washington office in February
  with its chief executive and co-founder, Alex Karp. Palantir was also
  co-founded by Peter Thiel, the PayPal billionaire who helped fund Trump’s 2016
  election camapign. Trade unions representing teachers and other council
  workers have said the deal raises “serious ethical questions”, and the
  independent councillor Grace Lewis called for the council to cancel the
  contract immediately “and ensure the £500,000 is spent right here in our
  community”. “It is indefensible that the council entered into a contract with
  Palantir, a company infamous for its role in providing weapons and
  surveillance to the IDF and its role in NHS privatisation, at a time when the
  council has made cuts to the public and voluntary sector,” Lewis said.
  Coventry recently started using Palantir’s AI to screen applications for
  household support funds. One senior official told a meeting of councillors in
  June: “There are very few areas that would not benefit from artificial
  intelligence.” A councillor at the meeting responded: “Sounds a bit like Big
  Brother to me.” In a letter to Nugent, the joint secretary of the Coventry
  branch of the National Education Union, Nicky Downes, highlighted Palantir’s
  use of AI in surveillance and weapons systems, and raised concerns about its
  collection and storing of data on citizens, in particular with respect to its
  provision of predictive policing systems. “There are some serious ethical
  questions regarding the business practices of Palantir Foundry, which is a
  subsidiary of Palantir,” Downes said. “There are also questions relating to
  its use of, and sourcing of, personal data. We would question the procurement
  process, particularly regarding ethical considerations and accompanying risk
  assessments, that led to the decision to spend £500,000 on an AI package from
  Palantir Foundry.” Nugent replied: “We have appointed Palantir for 12 months
  to explore the transformative opportunities of artificial intelligence by
  running proof of concepts in a number of our key areas. This will build our
  business case for further future investment and our overall approach to AI. We
  understand that the ethical implications of AI procurement are of paramount
  importance. Please be assured that the council has undertaken a thorough and
  robust due diligence process in line with our procurement policies.” A
  spokesperson for Palantir said: “We are excited to help Coventry city council
  harness AI to improve the services that they provide to the public. The
  technology offers huge potential, such as enabling social workers and special
  educational needs professionals to spend less time on paperwork and more time
  directly supporting children who are vulnerable or have special needs. The
  early signs are extremely promising, showing the potential for a significant
  reduction in the admin burden.” They said Palantir was non-partisan and had
  engaged with a number of US government administrations since it began working
  with the Department of Homeland Security in 2010. A spokesperson for the
  council said it was exploring how AI could help improve services and make them
  more efficient. “As part of this initiative, we are evaluating a range of AI
  solutions and technology partners, including Palantir, to support our AI
  objectives … As we continue to assess the value of AI for future investment,
  maintaining robust data protection and governance standards will remain our
  top priority.” It said the contract was awarded in line with standard
  procurement procedures and met its “rigorous security and compliance
  requirements”.
