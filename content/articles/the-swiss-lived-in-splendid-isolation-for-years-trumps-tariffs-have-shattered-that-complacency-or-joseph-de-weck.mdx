  Growing up in Zurich often felt like being removed from the world. It
  shouldn’t be that way: after all, Switzerland is at the heart of Europe.
  Riding on the cosy Zurich trams, one hears all the world’s languages; and the
  airport offers more direct intercontinental flights than Berlin. And yet,
  coming of age in Switzerland is like sitting in an aquarium looking at the
  world through a thick bulletproof window. That glass was shattered last week
  when Donald Trump announced 39% tariffs on Swiss exports. The US is the most
  important destination for Swiss products: 18.6% of all its exports go there.
  If Trump maintains the tariffs, sales to the US “will be effectively
  annihilated”, said Switzerland’s industry lobbying group. The rightwing Swiss
  business minister, Guy Parmelin, announced a furlough programme to shield the
  economy from “mass layoffs”. The tabloid newspaper Blick captured the mood
  with a stark black front page, pronouncing it a “black day” for Switzerland.
  Trump’s tariff shock has provoked a major identity crisis in a country that
  has grown rich on exports, and done so in splendid isolation from world
  politics. To understand Switzerland, imagine it as a giant country club.
  First, you don’t get in there easily: immigration laws are tight, although
  being rich helps. Second, it’s a tidy place: every inch of land is curated,
  and every lawn mowed. Third, there are ample leisure activities on offer:
  after work, the Swiss go biking, or show off their toned bodies on the shores
  of immaculate lakes. Most importantly, the Swiss club has traditionally
  offered its members tranquillity. History doesn’t happen here. The last war
  Switzerland was involved in was the Sonderbund war of 1847 (it lasted 26 days,
  and about 100 people died). The country has been run by a majority rightwing
  government since 1848. The Swiss economy has contracted in only six of the
  last 60 years. As a teenager in the 2000s, looking out through the bulletproof
  window at the rest of Europe, I saw Islamist terrorism and mass youth
  unemployment. We had none of it. Crime is low and social conflict barely
  exists, though Islamophobia did raise its ugly head in the 2009 vote to ban
  minarets. The Swiss have Europe’s lowest proportion of working days lost to
  strikes. Disputes are resolved through compromise, and frustrations vented
  through direct democracy, or drowned in a sea of passive-aggression. And yes,
  93.2% of trains do run on time. This all-pervasive sense of calm and
  predictability is perhaps the main reason why so many wealthy people move
  here. On a chaotic and anxious planet, Switzerland offers the luxury of living
  in a parallel reality – a chance to take a break from the world. That is the
  Swiss dream. That is the story of the children’s book Heidi, in which a
  wealthy German girl suffering big city life in Frankfurt escapes to the Alps.
  That is the story of Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, in which Europe’s
  neurotic elite retreats to the Swiss Alps to pontificate on the state of the
  world from a safe, numbing distance. Switzerland’s long history of neutrality
  and deliberate remoteness also nurtured a feeling of Swiss exceptionalism.
  Surviving two world wars untouched convinced many that staying alone means
  staying safe – indeed, that it can even be profitable, especially if you are
  happy to trade with Nazi Germany and apartheid South Africa. Isolationism
  carries benefits even today. Not being part of either Nato or the EU allows
  Switzerland to be the only European country, apart from Iceland, to have a
  free trade agreement with China. It also allows Berne to spend just 0.7% of
  GDP on defence – far below Nato’s 3.5% target. Swiss aid to Ukraine stands at
  just 0.13% of GDP, eight times lower than that of the Netherlands. Switzerland
  has thrived on being part of the free world without shouldering any of the
  burdens that come with it. But in the new era of cutthroat geoeconomics, this
  “have your cake and eat it” policy doesn’t work any more. Moreover, Trump’s
  move completely blindsided Berne. In Switzerland, many people assumed that the
  president Karin Keller-Sutter’s majority rightwing government would get along
  well with the Rolex-wearing Trump. After all, he dislikes the EU, taxes and
  wokeness, and so do the Swiss. When the US vice-president, JD Vance, argued at
  the Munich Security Conference in February that social media “censorship” was
  a bigger danger to Europe than Russia, Keller-Sutter praised the speech as
  “very Swiss”. Trump’s shocking tariff announcement has left the Swiss
  establishment clueless as to how to respond. Last week, Keller-Sutter tried to
  convince Trump to let go of the US’s $38bn trade deficit with Switzerland.
  Trump later said of the call, “The woman was nice, but she didn’t want to
  listen.” Switzerland has little leverage at its disposal. The country has
  already committed to buying F-35 fighter jets. Keller-Sutter can’t even
  promise to cut tariffs on US products. In 2024, Bern unilaterally eliminated
  tariffs on industrial products. If Trump adds pharmaceuticals to the 39%
  tariffs, the economic pain will be real: up to 0.7% of GDP a year or 700 Swiss
  francs a head, according to the Swiss Economic Institute. But the greater
  shock is psychological. A nation that has become accustomed to always getting
  its own way is now floundering, with a worse tariff rate than Algeria (30%).
  In a multicultural, federal country with four official languages, the grand
  unifying narrative of Swiss exceptionalism is in tatters. Perhaps worst of
  all, Brussels is getting a better trade deal than Berne. That is provoking a
  lot of head scratching in a country where support for EU membership stood at
  17% in a 2024 poll. Keeping the EU at a distance may no longer be the best
  option. The first test will come soon: the Swiss will vote on new economic
  treaties with the EU – something that the Swiss far right is fighting tooth
  and nail. Trump’s golf-cart style of governing ought to see him fit right in
  to the Swiss country club. Who would have guessed that he would be the one to
  finally shatter its splendid isolation? Joseph de Weck is a fellow with the
