  I read with interest the two pieces on the University of Edinburgh’s human
  cranium collection and its use in theories of biological determinism and
  racial superiority, beginning in the 18th century (Edinburgh University’s
  ‘skull room’ highlights its complicated history with racist science, 28 July;
  Phrenology and IQ tests: the far-right revival of discredited race science, 28
  July). Stephen Jay Gould’s tour de force The Mismeasure of Man (1981)
  thoroughly explored the history of craniology (skull measurement) and its
  misuse in promulgating race-based theories of human intelligence. Gould
  revised and expanded his book in 1996 in part to refute the arguments
  supporting race-based theories of human intelligence put forward in The Bell
  Curve, the 1994 bestseller that is mentioned in one of your articles. Gould
  focused on the work of one Edinburgh alumnus, Samuel George Morton, a
  Philadelphia physician and natural scientist who had amassed more than 1,000
  human skulls, which became the source of “data” for his scientific racism as
  promoted in American institutions of higher education at the time. Prof
  Catherine Hennessy Crieff, Perth and Kinross • The University of Edinburgh’s
  embracing racist theories and practices was not, of course, an unusual
  occurrence. When I joined the geography department of Newcastle University in
  1968, the departmental library had a long shelf of bound annual volumes of
  Eugenics Review. Libraries take journals to support the research of staff who
  subsequently list articles from the journals on reading lists for students. I
  know of no one, staff or student, using this academic resource in 1968. My
  point is that a very simple way to explore the embrace of race theories in
  British universities is to investigate past subscriptions to journals such as
  Eugenics Review. Peter Taylor Tynemouth, Tyne and Wear • The novel that
  remains really worth reading for a deeply emotive and human understanding of
  the mechanics and processes of the slave trade is Barry Unsworth’s Sacred
  Hunger, which deserves to be seen in the same small league as Moby-Dick.
  Though its British hub is Liverpool, it includes Scottish deckhands among its
  characters, as well as a meeting near the African coast between the slave ship
  at its centre with a rival slaver captained by a Scotsman, Macdonald. Accounts
  of ideological superstructure, such as those encouraged by Edinburgh
  University, provide a surface veneer of the true horror that only great
  fiction truly plumbs, and in this respect the Unsworth novel is incomparable.
