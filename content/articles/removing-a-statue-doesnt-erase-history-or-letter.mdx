  In response to the suggestion that removing statues is sanitising or censoring
  history (Letters, 24 August): statues are not a way of teaching or preserving
  history, they are a means of glorifying whoever or whatever is represented.
  Often they are outright forms of propaganda. Nobody learns accurate history
  from observing a statue. What they do is indicate that the values of the
  subject align with the values of the community, that their behaviour or
  achievements are approved of. When you see a statue, you think: “Ah, this
  person must have done something laudable of which we can be proud, otherwise
  why would they be honoured in this monument?” Removing a statue doesn’t erase
  history, but signals an evolution in values. One could even argue that it
  indicates an improved understanding of history, as we decide to stop ignoring
  or excusing appalling examples of violence, greed or self-interest. Leave the
  teaching of history to museums, books, documentaries and (ideally) schools.
