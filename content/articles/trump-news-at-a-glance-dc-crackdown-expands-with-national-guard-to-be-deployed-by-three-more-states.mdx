  After deploying the national guard to the streets of Washington DC, Donald
  Trump’s federal crackdown is moving into a new phase. Three more states – West
  Virginia, South Carolina and Ohio – have said they will deploy hundreds of
  national guard troops to DC in the coming days. But crime prevention workers
  say the move will do little to prevent crime, and address systemic cycles of
  violence and property crime. Anticipating a further rollout of the
  controversial policy, Democratic cities are preparing for the worst with
  mayors from Seattle to Baltimore vowing to protect their cities legally and
  otherwise. Here are the key stories at a glance. Three states to deploy
  national guard troops to Washington DC Three states have moved to send
  hundreds of members of their national guard to the nation’s capital as part of
  the Trump administration’s effort to overhaul policing in Washington DC
  through a federal crackdown. West Virginia said it was deploying 300 to 400
  guard troops while South Carolina pledged 200 and Ohio said it would send 150
  in the coming days. Read the full story Rubio says Russia and Ukraine both
  ‘have to make concessions’ for peace deal In a combative series of interviews
  on Sunday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said that “both sides are
  going to have to make concessions” for there to be a peaceful resolution to
  the war that erupted when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. “You can’t have a
  peace agreement unless both sides make concessions – that’s a fact,” the Trump
  administration’s top diplomat told ABC on Sunday. “That’s true in virtually
  any negotiation. If not, it’s just called surrender. And neither side is going
  to surrender. So both sides are going to have to make concessions.” Read the
  full story Judge restrains Beto O’Rourke’s group from sending funds to
  Democrats outside Texas A Texas judge has expanded a restraining order against
  former congressman Beto O’Rourke and his political organization over its
  fundraising for Democratic state lawmakers who left Texas to prevent a
  legislative session on congressional redistricting. Read the full story
  Ghislaine Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts likely a dud but other documents
  could reveal much When Donald Trump’s Department of Justice requested the
  release of grand jury transcripts in criminal proceedings against
  sex-traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, the move did little to
  quiet an ever-growing chorus of critics frustrated by the US president’s
  backtracking over disclosing investigative files. Read the full story What
  else happened today: Trump hiked tariffs on US imports. Now he’s looking at
  exports – sparking fears of a ‘dangerous precedent’, writes Lauren Arantani in
  this analysis. US state department stops issuing visas for Gaza’s children to
  get medical care after far-right campaign. Catching up? Here’s what happened
  Saturday 16 August.
