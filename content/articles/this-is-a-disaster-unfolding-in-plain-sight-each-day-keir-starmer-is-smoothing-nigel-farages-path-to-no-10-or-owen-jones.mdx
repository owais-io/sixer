  Britain isn’t sleepwalking into catastrophe; it’s charging towards it. Last
  year, a violent rightwing uprising tore through our streets – an attempted
  pogrom in which racists tried to burn asylum seekers alive, attacked homes and
  businesses thought to belong to migrants, petrol-bombed mosques and assaulted
  people of colour in broad daylight. That disgrace should hang permanently
  around the necks of the anti-migrant right, a warning of where scapegoating
  and toxic lies lead. Instead, the revolt succeeded. Anti-migrant rhetoric in
  politics and the press has grown more venomous. Reform UK now tops polls by a
  decisive margin. Its leader, Nigel Farage, raises the spectre of “major civil
  disorder” unless anti-migrant demands are met. Lucy Connolly – who was jailed
  after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire and is
  married to a former Conservative councillor – has been recast as a martyr by
  rightwing outlets and politicians. I don’t believe in jailing people for such
  speech, but her canonisation is chilling. Far-right activists cheered Robert
  Jenrick, the Tory leader-in-waiting, as he joined one of the anti-asylum
  protests sprouting across the country. Racist organisers boast that “the
  mainstream media are echoing our talking points”. Meanwhile, a mosque in
  Portsmouth was targeted, a nurse has been racially abused on camera in
  Halifax, a Chinese takeaway was daubed with racist slurs, and masked men tried
  to force their way into a west London hotel housing asylum seekers. Every
  racist in Britain feels emboldened. And yet the shameful role of Keir
  Starmer’s floundering administration is what brings us to the brink. First,
  Labour refuses to confront a broken economic model that breeds insecurity and
  hands extremists their raw material. Witness the party’s botched attacks on
  support for pensioners and disabled people, and note that average disposable
  incomes are projected to fall on their watch. Second, rather than leading
  against anti-migrant hysteria, Labour feeds it. The party pumps out
  Trump-style videos of dark-skinned migrants being deported. Farage is chided
  for “moaning from the sidelines”, while the government gets on with the
  business of kicking out foreigners. In 2021 the home secretary, then chair of
  the home affairs select committee, warned that without safe legal routes for
  family reunion, more people would be driven into the hands of criminal gangs;
  now she blocks refugees from reuniting with loved ones. Starmer, meanwhile,
  attacks the Tories from the right, accusing them of running an “open borders
  experiment”. He claimed immigration had done “incalculable damage” and warned
  Britain was becoming “an island of strangers”. He later disowned this Enoch
  Powell-esque language by blaming his speechwriters – confirming himself as the
  unprincipled frontman of a toxic faction. Hostility to migrants and refugees
  rests on lies that almost no prominent politician will challenge. That’s why
  Zack Polanski’s election as Green party leader is welcome: he unequivocally
  says that migrants are “not to blame” for crisis-stricken public services, and
  that we should instead focus our anger at “the private jets, the private
  yachts, and to multimillionaires and billionaires”. A Survation poll found
  that a quarter of voters believe people crossing in small boats make up the
  largest share of migrants; in reality they account for 2%. Forty-four per cent
  think refugees and asylum seekers are the majority of migrants; the true
  figure is 16%. YouGov finds that nearly half of the public believe most
  migrants here are “illegal”, though the vast majority arrived by plainly legal
  means. As for the law: the refugee convention forbids penalising asylum
  seekers for how they arrive. The greatest number of people arriving in small
  boats are from Afghanistan: a country we first helped destabilise by backing
  the mujahideen in the Soviet-Afghan war, which gave rise to the Taliban,
  before we participated in a disastrous 20-year military deployment in the wake
  of the “war on terror”. Despite our role in making nations like these unsafe,
  rich countries such as Britain take in about a quarter of the world’s
  refugees, a figure that was much lower before Ukrainians fled Russia’s
  invasion. And by choking off safe, legal routes, governments have pushed more
  people on to dangerous boats. Seven in 10 voters support people’s right to
  claim refuge from war or persecution in Britain. The trick has been to
  demonise the tiny numbers arriving by small boat in order to smear migrants as
  a whole. Yet when asked about particular groups – doctors, care home workers,
  catering staff, foreign students – the public mostly rejects cutting numbers.
  Labour chooses to cement, not challenge, these falsehoods. We know where that
  road ends. When France’s Emmanuel Macron adopted the right’s rhetoric and
  policies, Marine Le Pen proclaimed an “ideological victory” and only grew
  stronger. Austria’s mainstream parties championed anti-asylum detention and
  the veil clampdown; the Freedom Party surged in 2024. Germany’s Christian
  Democrats broke the “firewall” against the far right, backing a migrant
  crackdown motion with Alternative für Deutschland; the AfD duly advanced. As
  happened with these disasters, Labour is shifting the debate on to the terrain
  the migrant-bashing right desires. Their arguments are legitimised, and they
  will always outbid you on ferocity and “authenticity”. The alternative is
  obvious: transformative policies that lift living standards – taxing the
  well-off to rebuild public services – forcing the right on to the defensive
  and exposing it as the tribune of vested wealth with no interest in ordinary
  people’s security. Labour’s leaders are ideologically opposed to that path. So
  they have capitulated to Faragism. The result is plain: Britain is barrelling
  toward hard-right rule. Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist
