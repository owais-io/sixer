  The governor of the Bank of England blocked a meeting that Rachel Reeves tried
  to secure with watchdogs and Revolut, amid concerns the chancellor was
  meddling in an independent process over the fintech’s UK banking licence.
  Andrew Bailey intervened after learning of the plan to bring together
  representatives from Revolut, the Treasury and the Bank’s regulatory arm, the
  Prudential Regulation Authority, to discuss the fintech’s ambitions to become
  a fully authorised UK bank. The three-way meeting, first reported by the
  Financial Times, had been due to take place in the past few weeks but was
  cancelled over concerns that the central bank’s regulatory decisions should be
  independent from government interventions and influence. A Treasury
  spokesperson said: “The chancellor and the governor have a strong and
  productive relationship, and the government fully supports the operational
  independence of the Bank of England.” The Bank declined to comment. The
  meeting would have been part of the government’s charm offensive, with
  ministers desperate to convince Revolut – last estimated to be worth $45bn
  (£33.6bn) – to choose London for its much-awaited stock market debut primary
  listing. Ministers have been spooked by comments from Revolut’s co-founder and
  chief executive, Nik Storonsky, who suggested last December that New York
  could be a better fit because of the regulatory environment and the size of
  the market. Losing Revolut, which is Europe’s most valuable private fintech,
  would represent a major blow to the City and the London Stock Exchange, which
  has suffered from a growing number of defections, with companies snubbing the
  UK for listings abroad. The chancellor has also been urging UK watchdogs to
  support financial firms in the name of growth, having gone so far as to claim
  in her Mansion House speech this month that regulation was acting as a “boot
  on the neck” of businesses. Revolut secured a limited UK banking licence last
  year after a rare three-year wait, having had to convince regulators it had
  addressed a number of accounting issues and EU regulatory breaches, as well as
  reputational concerns, including about an overaggressive corporate culture.
  The fintech company says it has since resolved those accounting and regulatory
  problems, and has made efforts to improve its working culture. However, the
  fintech was only granted a restricted licence and, 12 months on, has yet to
  have its application fully authorised. The restrictions mean it cannot
  currently offer its own loans in the UK, and while it can hold customer
  deposits, they are capped at £50,000. Banks are usually put under these
  restrictions until they can prove they have appropriate staff, IT systems and
  governance and accountability checks in place to satisfy officials. Revolut
  has been hoping to gain full approval from UK regulators this year. A fully
  fledged licence would open the door to new income streams, allowing it to
  start funding own-branded loans and mortgages. It would also mean it would
  face stricter regulations and make it part of the compensation scheme. A full
  licence was expected to be the first step in opening the door to banking
  licences in other countries, including the US. Revolut has already secured an
  EU banking licence through Lithuania. In the absence of UK approval, it has
  emerged that Revolut is considering buying an American bank in order to secure
  an American banking licence and accelerate its expansion stateside. The
  fintech company originally launched as a prepaid card focused on free currency
  exchange for customers. It has since grown to more than 10,000 staff, serving
  customers in more than 36 countries, with more than 50 products and services.
  As well as money transfers, it offers home rentals, buy now, pay later credit,
  wage advances, e-sims for mobile data plans and crypto trading. Its annual
  report in April showed Revolut more than doubled its annual profits in 2024,
  jumping almost 150% to £1bn, thanks to a rise in subscriptions, and revenues
  from its wealth and crypto trading divisions.
