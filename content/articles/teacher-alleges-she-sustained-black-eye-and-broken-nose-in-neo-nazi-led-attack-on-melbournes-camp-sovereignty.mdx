  A 30-year-old schoolteacher says she has sustained a black eye and a broken
  nose that may need surgery after a group of men, including neo-Nazis, attacked
  Camp Sovereignty in Melbourne on Sunday. Yasmin*, who asked that her real name
  not be used, told Guardian Australia she had spent a couple of quiet hours at
  the camp, a standing First Nations protest site just south of the Yarra River,
  on Sunday afternoon after volatile anti-immigration rallies, led by neo-Nazis,
  had swept through the city earlier that day. She had just begun heading home,
  walking away from the camp, when she “heard a huge commotion”. “I turned
  around and I saw what looked like a hundred men in black uniform in formation
  storming up the hill,” Yasmin said. “I knew that there were lots of women at
  that camp and lots of vulnerable people and I ran right back.” The men were
  carrying poles and sticks, Yasmin said. “I had to run through the crowd to get
  to my friends. And as I was running, a boy grabbed my hair and pulled me
  towards him. And he said, ‘Come here, bitch,’ and he just punched me square in
  the face.” She said she fell to the ground, and the boy “threw himself” on top
  of her and “just started laying into my face. And while that was happening,
  there were four men standing around me, filming me – on their side – filming
  this kid … he was all of maybe 15 years old … Another one was on the side of
  me kicking into my ribs. And then another one was going to beat me with a
  pole.” Yasmin said the nearby men were instructing her assailants, but told
  the man with the pole not to hit her with it. “The young boys were the ones
  that were beating me,” she said, “listening to the directive of the older
  men”. The assault only stopped when someone pulled the boy off her, Yasmin
  said, and she ran to the back of the camp, bleeding. Guardian Australia
  understands no charges have been laid over the alleged assault. Video footage
  of the incident, seen by Guardian Australia, showed at least 50 men, mostly
  clad in black, approaching the Camp Sovereignty site as the sun was setting,
  attacking camp signage and violently swinging sticks and poles at camp
  attenders. Four people required medical attention and two were taken to
  hospital with severe head injuries. A spokesperson for Victoria police said
  crime investigation unit detectives were continuing to investigate the
  incident. “It was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever encountered,” Yasmin
  said. “They were militant, they were organised, they had walkie-talkies, they
  were wearing mouth guards, they had body-cams. They knew what they were doing
  … It wasn’t a clash, it was just an assault.” On Tuesday morning, the mood at
  Camp Sovereignty was subdued. Under a tarp, police were conducting interviews
  with witnesses. Smoke from the continuously burning sacred fire drifted across
  the lawn towards a row of tents, many of which had been erected after a call
  went out on Monday for people to gather to protect the camp from further
  attacks. PJ, a Barkandji/Latji Latji man and camp regular, who was present
  during the incident on Sunday, said the mood at the camp had been “a little
  bit rocky, a bit up and down” since. “We’re still on edge,” PJ said. “They
  come here just to inflict terror and violence. They weren’t here for any good
  cause; they weren’t here to sit down and chit chat. No, they come for
  violence.” The community had rallied around them since the news had
  circulated, he said. Krautungalung elder Robbie Thorpe, who established the
  camp on a sacred Aboriginal burial site that was otherwise marked only by a
  rock and a plaque, said he felt the incident was an escalation. “Australia is
  an institution of racism,” Thorpe said. “It’s the institutions of this country
  that have allowed this to manifest. They’re running around saying stop
  immigration; they’re immigrants themselves. They’re carrying a British flag
  around.” “They can get away with the abuse because it’s a national pastime.
  It’s in the national interest to deny us our rights. So that gives them a
  licence to do what they like.” Camp Sovereignty had been concerned about the
  risk of far-right violence directed towards the camp after Anzac Day, when a
  “known neo-Nazi” heckled during the dawn service at the nearby Shrine of
  Remembrance, and had been lobbying for a permanent structure on the site, like
  the nearby MPavilion, to properly mark it and reduce the risk to campers.
  Victorian senator Lidia Thorpe, Robbie Thorpe’s niece, said on Monday the
  alleged “unprovoked, coordinated Nazi attack on Aboriginal people” was “racism
  out on full display” and ought to be investigated as a hate crime. “The aim of
  this attack was to cause fear and terror in the hearts and minds of our
  people, and black and brown people across the country,” Thorpe said. On
  Monday, prime minister Anthony Albanese said of the rallies that “not
  everybody there was associated with neo-Nazis”, but raised concerns about
  polarisation, radicalisation and people following “rabbit holes” to extremism.
  On Tuesday, federal Indigenous affairs minister Malarndirri McCarthy described
  the attacks on the camp as “absolutely reprehensible”, saying she had “never
  seen this kind of attack in my parliamentary career”. *Name has been changed
