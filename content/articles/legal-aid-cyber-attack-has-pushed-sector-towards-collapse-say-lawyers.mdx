  Lawyers have warned that a cyber-attack on the Legal Aid Agency has pushed the
  sector into chaos, with barristers going unpaid, cases being turned away and
  fears a growing number of firms could desert legal aid work altogether. In
  May, the legal aid agency announced that the personal data of hundreds of
  thousands of legal aid applicants in England and Wales dating back to 2010 had
  been accessed and downloaded in a significant cyber-attack. Three months on,
  much of the legal aid system remains offline as services are being rebuilt,
  with lawyers unable to access records or bill for their services, particularly
  in civil cases. Chris Minnoch, the chief executive of the Legal Aid
  Practitioners Group, said he had had members calling him in tears, staying up
  into the night waiting for payments to come through and having to negotiate
  extended overdrafts. “Lots of barristers and solicitors are saying to us: this
  is the straw that breaks the camel’s back. We wouldn’t be surprised that by
  the time things are eventually fixed, there will be fewer [legal aid]
  providers because people just can’t take the stress any more,” he said.
  Although the Legal Aid Agency has set up a contingency payment system, where
  legal aid practitioners can apply for weekly payments equivalent to the
  average they were paid in the three months running up to the hack, many said
  it was not enough. One barrister working primarily on legal aid cases, who
  asked not to be named, said they were offered only £9.50 a week under the
  contingency scheme. “Its obviously really laughable and I know a lot of
  colleagues were offered a very low rate,” they said. “I am still doing legal
  aid work, but financially I am not in a good position. I’ve had to think about
  other forms of income, rely more on my partner, and I’m just not able to
  afford certain things that I would otherwise. “It’s particularly had a really
  massive impact on barristers from working-class backgrounds.” Jenny Beck KC,
  of Beck Fitzgerald, which specialises in supporting victims of domestic abuse,
  said the contingency payments had enabled the legal firm to keep going, but
  could cause a headache further down the line. “They are based on a
  guesstimate, so if we underclaim or overclaim, we’ll be in some difficulty,”
  she said. “We’re literally flying blind in an area where there’s no margin to
  play with. So from a business perspective, it’s deeply dangerous.” She said
  lawyers were spending at least an extra two hours on each case due to online
  systems being down and they were having to turn away more people as a result.
  “The bottom-line impact is that we can look after fewer clients because our
  processing times for everything are longer,” she said. “We now have to keep a
  manual note of everything; we’ve gone back to paper which we’re later going to
  have to input. “We’ve got no management information, we’ve got no control over
  our cashflow, and everyone at the frontline is beleaguered and exhausted
  because their administrative hours have doubled and they’re able to help less
  people.” She also said the hack had badly damaged trust with vulnerable
  clients. “The people who are at most risk and who need confidentiality like
  nobody else, we’re telling them, well, we’ve been putting your stuff into an
  unsafe system,” she said. “It’s a major erosion of trust.” There have long
  been concerns about legal aid “deserts” as lawyers have gradually withdrawn
  from services due to lack of funding, and there are fears the long-term
  consequence of the hack will be less access to justice for the most vulnerable
  in society. “We’re constantly forced to turn away work because we just don’t
  have capacity to, and that was happening even before the hack just because of
  the limited funding of legal aid,” said Abbi Hart, the co-chair of Young Legal
  Aid Lawyers. “This is just going to make it worse. The system was in a pretty
  bad way beforehand, now it’s even more concerning.” A Legal Aid Agency
  spokesperson said: “We apologise for the disruption the changes to payment
  processes made in response to the cyber attack have caused. We understand the
  difficulties this is causing civil legal aid providers and are working as
  quickly as possible to restore online systems. “A contingency system is in
  place and barristers and solicitors can use our simple escalation process if
  they feel the average pay figure is inaccurate.”
