  Depending on your temperament, having a Michelin-starred chef drop by with
  something to throw on your back-garden barbecue might be a dream come true, or
  a bit of a nightmare. Will they judge us for buying ready-made coleslaw? Will
  they notice how excessively charred the drumsticks are? But chefs are people
  too – and they like being invited over for a burger and a beer just as much as
  the rest of us. It’s just that their burgers might be made from dry-aged
  steak, minced by hand that morning, paired with a carefully chosen
  low-intervention wine. Chefs also like thinking beyond burgers, sausages and
  all the other traditional barbecue favourites, which is why, when we asked 18
  of the UK’s best chefs what they would take to a barbecue, they recommended
  everything from chilli-spiked watermelon salad and intensely flavoured Korean
  marinades to dry non-alcoholic aperitifs and beautiful tins of spiced salt.
  (And not a tub of coleslaw in sight.) The veggie barbie star I always bring a
  large head of cabbage – hispi if I can find it, but napa or white work well,
  too. I cut it into thick wedges (keeping the core intact so they don’t fall
  apart), brush them with olive oil, season generously, and char directly over
  the flames until the outer leaves are blackened and blistered and the inside
  goes sweet and tender. Then I make a dressing: either whisk together tahini, a
  bit of yoghurt, lemon juice, garlic and water to make a creamy sauce, or
  simply use some creme fraiche with lemon juice and garlic stirred though. I
  spoon this over the cabbage and finish it off with whatever chilli oil or
  chilli sauce happens to be around, and a sprinkle of fresh herbs (only if I
  have them). Yotam Ottolenghi, chef, restaurateur and food writer Throw a few
  prawns on the grill Barbecued prawns with harissa mayo make a perfect barbecue
  starter: place 1kg of raw shell-on tiger prawns in a bowl with two teaspoons
  of crushed cumin seeds, two tablespoons each of rose harissa paste and olive
  oil and the zest of two limes. Leave for 30 minutes. Make a sauce with 150g
  mayonnaise, two teaspoons of rose harissa paste, the juice of a lime and one
  tablespoon of chopped dill. Barbecue the marinated prawns for 2-3 minutes each
  side over the hottest part of the grill, until cooked through and lightly
  charred. Serve with the mayo and lime wedges. Tom Kerridge, chef, restaurateur
  and author of The BBQ Book. His newest pub is The Chalk in London The Italian
  barbecue go-to In Italy, when we have a barbecue everyone brings something. My
  favourite at the moment is spring onions wrapped in streaky bacon. I wrap
  20-30 individual spring onions in streaky bacon, chill and then transfer them
  straight on to the grill. The stems are perfectly salted due to the bacon and
  are delicious with a homemade spicy mayo. Giorgio Locatelli, Michelin-starred
  chef, who has a new restaurant at London’s National Gallery Just add chilli –
  to everything I would never arrive at a barbecue without ají (chilli) sauce: I
  always have a Kilner jar of it in the fridge. I make it with six large ripe
  vine tomatoes and 10 red chilies, blackened over the barbecue or in a hot dry
  pan, then mashed or blitzed with the juice of a lime and plenty of salt. I
  would also bring a spice mix from Field Blends: they do a delicious maple
  chilli salt, perfect for sprinkling over meats and salads and they come in
  handy little tins, so easy to pop in your bag. Ana Ortiz, chef/co-founder of
  Fire Made in Somerset Knock up an Aperol spritz bar I love taking an Aperol
  spritz station to a barbecue. A rigid coolbox – so the lid can double up as a
  table – filled with ice, sliced oranges, Aperol, San Pellegrino and sparkling
  wine. I have a stash of Bonne Maman jam jars to use as glasses. I get no
  enjoyment from drinking anything – even champagne – from a paper or plastic
  cup. Sturdy glasses all the way. Rukmini Iyer, chef and author of The Green
  Barbecue Kebabs are kings A particular favourite is chicken or lamb kebabs,
  marinaded in yoghurt with spices overnight and then skewered with slices of
  lemon and red onion. With a salad of roast aubergine, cucumber, tomato, red
  onion and mint finished with a splash of red wine vinegar. And then sauces and
  flatbreads are king of the barbecue – tahini or chermoula work particularly
  well here. To drink, I love Small Beer or Jubel peach beer. Julius Roberts,
  chef, farmer and author of the Farm Diaries newsletter and the book The Farm
  Table Carry a watermelon – not just for dessert My father carried watermelons
  as gifts to parties long before Baby in Dirty Dancing ever did. At this time
  of year when the weather is very hot, they are a perfect, big-bellied
  crowd-pleaser – so refreshing and rehydrating. They can be chopped up and
  turned into salads, too. I’m partial to a dressing made with smashed garlic,
  birdseye chilli, palm sugar, fish sauce or soy, tamarind and lime juice; then
  add roasted cashews and fistfuls of Thai basil. To drink, I don’t think you
  can do better than rosé. Ravinder Bhogal, chef-patron of Jikoni and author of
  Comfort and Joy The best fish for the job I would bring a whole turbot: it’s
  one of the best things you can cook on a barbecue as its high collagen content
  keeps the fish moist, creating rich, gelatinous juices under the skin. Pat the
  fish dry and brush it with olive oil, season with salt, then place in a fish
  grill. Barbecue for about eight minutes a side. Niklas Ekstedt,
  Michelin-starred chef and founder of fire-based restaurant Ekstedt at the Yard
  in London Get a little salty To make a barbecue go down a storm I arrive with
  a pot of Cornish smoked sea salt, which has a big smack of smoky flavour, and
  some Chimac sriracha caramel sauce, which you can glaze vegetables with or dip
  straight into. Condimaniac does brilliant rubs and sauces, but their best is
  an onion gravy ketchup. For drinks, Knightor vermouth is delicious – serve
  with an orange slice, olive and ice. Otherwise Yew’s rhubarb-flavoured
  sparkling water is great if you’re not drinking. Lagom Chef (AKA Martyn
  Odell), chef and TikToker The cover-all-bases marinade Cortas pomegranate
  molasses is a perfect one-bottle marinade. It works its magic on chicken
  (wings in particular), lamb (we’re thinking chops), pork or beef, or as a
  post-grill drizzle on your meat or vegetables for an instant sweet and sour
  seasoning. Itamar Srulovich and Sarit Packer, chefs at Honey &amp; Co and
  authors of Chasing Smoke: Cooking Over Fire Around the Levant You can’t beat a
  potato salad I love a good old potato salad at a barbecue. New potatoes boiled
  whole, thinly sliced fennel and red onion, lots of fresh dill and a dressing
  with unrefined sunflower oil, mustard, lemon and honey. Carrot and red pepper
  tapenade is also ideal with anything grilled. It’s very simple: thinly sliced
  onions, red pepper and grated carrots are cooked down to a jammy consistency,
  seasoned with salt, sugar and smoked paprika, doused in olive oil and some red
  wine vinegar, then rested in the fridge overnight. Alissa Timoshkina, chef,
  food historian and author of Kapusta A non-alcoholic aperitivo Botivo is an
  alcohol-free drink for grownups, made from cider vinegar with botanicals. It’s
  low in calories so it’s quite healthy, but it can also be mixed with tequila.
  Also Slap ya Mama is a seasoning rub that I like to use liberally
  post-barbecuing. Richard Turner, chef, director at Bodean’s and co-founder of
  the Meatopia barbecue food festival A beaujolais that goes with everything
  Trenel’s red beaujolais, made from the Gamay grape, is perfect for grilled
  meat, fish and vegetables. I think it’s wonderful chilled, so it’s perfect for
  outdoor summer meals. Michel Roux Jr, Michelin-starred chef at Chez Roux and
  TV presenter Pass the peas In season, I take peas in their pods. You can grill
  them whole on the barbecue and then toss with sea salt, plenty of soft
  aromatic herbs, such as mint and dill, and serve to be eaten a little like
  edamame. Tomos Parry, Michelin-starred chef of Brat and Mountain restaurants A
  showstopper of a salad I would take a big beany salad, one you can make at
  home and then take with you. It uses ingredients that will sit happily
  wallowing in their juices for at least a couple of hours and taste better as
  the flavours develop. Chopped fresh tomatoes, different colours and sizes,
  plus lots of fresh herbs, a good dressing, some jarred peppers or artichokes,
  and not forgetting my favourite – some big creamy butter beans. It only takes
  minutes to mix it all together, but you look like a hero when you place it on
  the table. Claire Thomson, chef and author of One Pan Beans Baked onions,
  Sicilian style In Sicily, they bake whole unpeeled onions wrapped in foil,
  like potatoes, nestled in the embers, and let them get so soft they are almost
  a relish. I also often take peperonata, a multipurpose marinade, side or
  relish which is a cooked mix of tomatoes, onions and peppers. Rachel Roddy,
  Rome-based chef and author of An A-Z of Pasta A spicy Korean twist Whenever
  I’m going to a barbecue, the first thing I put in the cool box is Ssamjang
  Korean soybean paste. Made from a mix of gochujang and doenjang (fermented
  pastes), sesame oil and garlic, it makes a great marinade and is the ultimate
  dip for grilled meats, fish or vegetables. It’s even better if you wrap it all
  up with raw chilli and garlic in a fresh salad leaf. Kyu Jeon, chef-owner of
  Korean restaurants Bokman and Dongnae Take a cooling dip I always take a
  homemade dip. My favourite is a crispy spring onion one. I crisp a chopped
  bunch of spring onions in olive oil, add a half a teaspoon of turmeric, the
  same of dried chilli and a pinch of salt and sugar, then take off the heat.
  Once cool, ripple it over about 300g of salted thick Greek yoghurt. Anna
  Jones, chef and author of Easy Wins
