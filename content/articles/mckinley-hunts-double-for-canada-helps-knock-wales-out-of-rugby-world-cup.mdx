  Canada emphatically booked their place in the knockout stages of the Rugby
  World Cup and inflicted a second successive defeat on Wales. Kévin Rouet’s
  Canada have lived up to the billing inside the opening fortnight with
  back-to-back victories that have been both impressive and eye-catching. They
  were far superior to the Welsh here, scoring six tries without reply to set up
  a showdown with Scotland next weekend, when victory in Exeter will confirm
  them as Pool B winners. On back-to-back weekends in Salford, Wales have
  flattered to deceive. However, while this was a disappointment against a very
  strong Canada side, the damage was done on the opening weekend against
  Scotland. There was no getting away from the fact that that game was do-or-die
  given the contrasting strength of the other two teams in Pool B. That
  performance will ultimately be the one to cost them. They needed to cause a
  major upset here to stand any realistic chance of qualifying and despite
  showing some early signs of promise, they were unable to take any of their
  opportunities inside the opening quarter. How Canada punished them with a
  devastating show of ruthlessness. “I saw improvements and that’s what I
  wanted,” the Wales coach, Sean Lynn, said. “The glimpses I saw in the last 20
  minutes, that’s what I wanted but we didn’t capitalise in that first quarter.
  But I’m super proud of them.” McKinley Hunt opened the scoring with the
  Canadian’s first real chance before a blitz of three tries in five minutes
  swung it decisively their way, pushing them into a 28-0 lead by half-time
  which Wales never really showed any signs of overcoming. But as poor as this
  was for Wales, this was a destructive showing of Canada’s title credentials on
  multiple fronts. They were heavy favourites to qualify from this group and
  move on to the knockout stages but the manner in which they have done so
  during their first two games has been hugely impressive, and a statement to
  the rest of the field. Even at 42-0, when Canada spurned an opportunity to go
  further ahead and inflict more misery on the Welsh, Rouet was seen shaking his
  head. They were clearly not content with mere qualification here; they wanted
  to do so in style. “We know we have a job to do to refine our game,” Rouet
  said. “I am excited for next week because we want to play a good game of
  rugby.” Their front five were immense all afternoon, led by the wonderful
  Sophie de Goede throughout, and when you have players of the calibre of the
  imperious Olivia Apps to come from the bench, you have all the hallmarks of a
  group that can cause anyone problems across the full 80 minutes of any
  contest. Perhaps this afternoon might have played out differently had Wales
  taken early advantage of their opportunities. However, their profligacy was
  punished in stunning fashion by the Canadians, beginning when Hunt forced her
  way over after 17 minutes. Wales hung in for a brief period trailing 7-0 but
  when Alysha Corrigan finished a wonderful team move, it began a sequence of
  tries that all but ended this clash as a contest. Hunt quickly claimed her
  second before a minute later, Asia Hogan-Rochester pushed her way across the
  line, with De Goede converting all four. A big lead at the break meant Wales
  needed somewhat of a miracle against such a dominant side to mount a comeback.
  That never really felt likely, and the result was decided when Taylor Perry
  and Brittany Kassil crossed for tries inside three second-half minutes. Wales
  dug in with great credit in that final 25 minutes but ultimately, the game had
  long since been decided. England would have probably watched this contest in
  the run-up to their meeting with Samoa on Saturday evening. If they did, they
  will have almost certainly been impressed and put on notice. McGhie and Orr
  take Scotland into last eight Scotland booked their spot in the Women’s World
  Cup quarter-finals after battling to a 29-15 win over resilient Fiji at
  Salford Community Stadium. Another early try from Francesca McGhie and a brace
  from Rhona Lloyd helped Scotland establish a 17-5 half-time lead but Manuqalo
  Komaitai’s score after the restart left this Pool B clash in the balance.
  However, McGhie’s fifth try of the tournament and Emma Orr’s excellent solo
  effort – earning Scotland a bonus point – helped Bryan Easson’s side claim a
  hard-fought victory which guarantees a top-two spot. Fiji scored a late
  consolation through Karalaini Naisewa but their group-stage exit was
  confirmed, with Wales also eliminated after Scotland joined Canada, the pool
  leaders and favourites, on 10 points. While they were 10-0 up after 10
  minutes, Scotland were put through their paces in a hard-fought match, with
  two of their four tries arriving when Fiji were down to 14 with players in the
  sin-bin. PA Media
