  In a letter sent to Smithsonian secretary, Lonnie G Bunch III, on 12 August,
  the Trump administration announced its plan to replace all Smithsonian
  exhibits deemed as “divisive” or “ideological” with descriptions deemed as
  “historical” and “constructive”. On 21 August, just nine days later, the White
  House published a list of said offending fixtures – the majority of which
  include exhibits, programming and artwork that highlight the Black, Latino and
  LGBTQ+ perspectives on the American project. Included in his bill of
  particulars was an exhibit that rightly depicts Benjamin Franklin as an
  enslaver, an art installation that acknowledges race as a social construct and
  a display that highlights racist voter suppression measures, among others. The
  assault on the Smithsonian comes wrapped, as it were, as part of a broader
  attack on democracy, scenes of which we see playing out every day. The federal
  occupation of Washington DC, the crackdown on free speech on campus, the
  targeting of Trump’s political opponents, the gerrymandering of democracy –
  these are interwoven elements of the same structural assault. So with many
  fires burning across the nation, concerned citizens who are answering the call
  to fight the destruction of democracy may regard his attack on history and
  memory as a mere skirmish, a distraction from the herculean struggle against
  fascism unfolding in the US. But this is a mistake. Trump’s attack on American
  museums, education and memory, along with his weaponization of racialized
  resentment to package his authoritarian sympathies as mere patriotism, is a
  critical dimension of his fascist aims. The fight for democracy cannot avoid
  it, nor its racial conditions of possibility. Fascism always has a central
  cultural component, because it relies on the construction of a mythic past.
  The mythic past is central to fascism because it enables and empowers a sense
  of grievance by a dominant racial or ethnic group whose consent is crucial to
  the sustainability of the project. In Maga world, the mythic past was pure,
  innocent and unsullied by women or Black leaders. In this kind of politics,
  the nation was once great, a byproduct of the great achievements of the men in
  the dominant racial group. In short, the assault on the Smithsonian and, more
  broadly, against truthful history and critical reflection is part of the
  broader fascist attack on democracy. From this vantage point, racial equality
  is a threat to the story of the nation’s greatness because only the men of the
  dominant group can be great. To represent the nation’s founding figures as
  flawed, as any accurate history would do, is perceived, in this politics, as a
  kind of treason. The success of the fascist dismantling of democracy is
  predicated on the widespread systematic failure to see the larger picture. The
  anti-woke assault that is a key pillar of Trumpism is part of that failure,
  partly due to the racial blinders and enduring ambivalence of too many in
  positions of leadership in the media and elsewhere. Those who sign on to the
  attack on “wokeness” but regard themselves as opponents of the other elements
  of the fascist assault are under the mistaken assumption that these projects
  can be disaggregated. In fact, the dismantling of democracy and of racial
  justice are symbiotically entangled. To support one is to give cover for the
  others. It is clear that the Trump administration understands this
  relationship and fully weaponizes racist appeals as a foundational piece of
  its fascist agenda. And if this was once the quiet part, it is now pronounced
  out loud in official government documents. In an executive order issued on 27
  March 2025 titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History”, Trump
  reveals that his mandate to ban “improper ideologies” targets core commitments
  repudiating a scientific racism that historically naturalized racial hierarchy
  thereby neutralizing resistance. According to Trump, the problem with the
  Smithsonian American Art Museum’s exhibit The Shape of Power: Stories of Race
  and American Sculpture was that it promoted the idea that “race is a human
  invention”. The understanding that race is a social construct as opposed to a
  biological fact is perhaps the most fundamental advance in repudiating
  enslavement, genocide and segregation. Rejecting the idea that racial
  inequality is natural or pre-ordained – a claim that grounded enslavement and
  dispossession in America – forms the cornerstone of the modern commitment to a
  fully inclusive democracy. Trump’s declaration that this cornerstone is
  “improper” is an effort to turn the clock back, upending the entire American
  postwar project. It is no coincidence that this “proper” ideology Trump
  exposes is constitutive of a more well-known strand of fascism – nazism. How
  else can we understand why Maya Angelou was purged from the Naval Academy
  library while Adolf Hitler remains? The fight against fascism in the US must
  be as robust in its embrace of racial equality as Trump’s embrace of outdated
  ideas about race and racism. The defense of memory, of truthful history, of
  telling the whole American story rather than ascribing agency in history to
  the deeds of “great men” is vital to the American democratic project. A
  pro-democratic education fosters the agency of its citizens by teaching about
  social movements that overturned entrenched hierarchies which blocked
  democratic equality and imposed racial tyranny. The story of how ordinary
  Americans lived and struggled and remade America is essential knowledge in
  developing and sustaining a multiracial democracy. The Smithsonian has been a
  vital institution in making this knowledge accessible to the masses. The
  National Museum of the American Latino and the National Museum of the American
  Indian, for example, provide artifacts and perspectives about the nation’s
  westward expansion that challenge the myth of unoccupied territory and
  manifest destiny. The National Museum of African American History and Culture
  brings forward the global scale of enslavement as well as its infusion across
  national institutions, culture and politics. Museums allow us to reckon with
  the brutality of the American legacy as well as expose our citizens to the
  people, institutions and strategies that charted a different course towards
  becoming a “more perfect” union. Fascist erasures like Trump’s hide behind the
  claim that truthful encounters with the past inflame and divide. This instinct
  is the opposite of the truth. A functioning democracy does not restrict
  perspectives to those of the dominant group, much less make it illegal to
  teach alternative ones. A people who cannot remember their past are a people
  who cannot resist a fascist future. Knowing our history can give us the
  weapons and wherewithal to battle Trump’s efforts to catapult us back to a
  time when the majority of Americans lacked both the civic and economic power
  that we have now. The fight for our museums and for our memory is a critical
  bulwark against the unraveling of American democracy. It is vital that we
  fight to protect our repositories before it’s too late. Kimberlé Crenshaw is
  an American civil rights advocate and a scholar of critical race theory. She
  is a professor at the UCLA School of Law and Columbia Law School, where she
  specializes in race and gender issues Jason Stanley is Jacob Urowsky professor
  of philosophy at Yale University. He is the author of How Fascism Works
