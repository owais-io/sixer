  began

  The number of people arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel in
  small boats has passed 25,000 faster this year than since records began. As
  ministers aim to “smash the gangs” involved in people-smuggling, 898 people
  made the journey in 13 boats on Wednesday, bringing the total for 2025 so far
  to 25,436. The latest Home Office figures show an increase of 51% compared
  with this point last year (16,842) and 73% higher than that of 2023 (14,732).
  It is the earliest point in a calendar year the 25,000 mark has been passed
  since data on Channel crossings was first reported in 2018. Last year, the
  figure was passed on 22 September, and in 2023 it was 2 October. The first
  year in which at least 25,000 arrivals were recorded was 2022, when the
  milestone was passed on 27 August, and the total went on to hit a record
  45,774 by the end of December. The record arrivals come after ministers
  announced a flurry of measures this spring and summer to reduce the number of
  crossings. Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party has made gains in the polls after
  attacks on Labour for failing to curb irregular migration. Keir Starmer
  announced a “one in, one out” returns deal with France earlier this month, –
  whereby the UK will send migrants back to France in exchange for asylum
  seekers with links to Britain. However, the pilot has not yet begun. Last
  month, French police for the first time used knives to slash dinghies which
  were already in the sea, as a result of negotiations with the UK, and the UK
  foreign secretary, David Lammy, announced a new sanctions regime to target
  those involved in Channel smuggling. The Guardian disclosed on Wednesday that
  an extra 445 spaces were being prepared to house male asylum seekers at RAF
  Wethersfield in Essex despite previous promises to cut the numbers there. A
  Home Office spokesperson said: “All use of property or sites under our
  ownership is carried out in accordance with relevant planning permissions, and
  we work together with local authorities and other stakeholders to ensure the
  accommodation estate is continuously reviewed and managed safely and
  effectively at all times.” The move also follows a series of demonstrations
  outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, after a male asylum seeker
  was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. On
  Wednesday, local political leaders urged the home secretary to make the Bell
  hotel in Essex a “priority for urgent closure”, citing community tensions that
  have put a strain on policing. Essex police said 14 people had been charged in
  connection with protests at the site and there had been 23 arrests. Downing
  Street warned in July that a repeat of last summer’s rioting could happen and
  said Britain was “fraying at the edges”. Starmer told the cabinet it was vital
  to repair Britain’s “social fabric” and improve integration in areas that have
  experienced high levels of migration.
