  Palestine Action’s co-founder has won a bid to bring a high court challenge
  over the group’s ban as a terrorist organisation, which has made membership of
  or support for the direct action group a criminal offence punishable by up to
  14 years in prison. About 200 people have been arrested on suspicion of
  publicly protesting in support for PA since it was banned. They include: Jon
  Farley, 67 Retired teacher Farley was picked up by police at a silent
  demonstration in Leeds for holding a sign that made a joke about the
  government’s proscription of Palestine Action taken from an issue of the
  fortnightly satirical magazine Private Eye. He was arrested under section 12
  of the Terrorism Act 2000, which he described as a “pretty terrifying and
  upsetting experience”. Farley, who had never been arrested before, told the
  Guardian: “I clearly wasn’t any kind of physical threat.” The Private Eye
  editor, Ian Hislop, said the arrest was “mind-boggling”. Marianne Sorrell, 80
  Retired teacher Sorrell, from Wells, Somerset, was arrested for holding a
  placard at a pro-Palestine rally in Cardiff, and she was held by police for
  almost 27 hours, during which officers forced their way into her house and
  searched it. She said officers removed 19 items from her home, including
  iPads, a Palestinian flag, books on Palestine, material related to Extinction
  Rebellion and the climate crisis, as well as drumsticks for – and a belt that
  holds – her samba drum. “At 80, to be treated like a dangerous terrorist is
  deeply shocking. I’ve been very traumatised by this. Every morning I wake up
  feeling sick, nauseous. [I have] had to take anti-sickness pills,” she told
  the Guardian. Trisha Fine, 75 Retired teacher Also from Wells and a friend of
  Sorrell, Fine was held for the same period of time. The women have been bailed
  until October. Their bail conditions prohibit contact with each other and
  spending any nights away from their homes. She said that during her detention
  officers refused to let her have the antibiotics she was taking for a serious
  gum infection, and failed to call her husband, who is recovering from cancer
  treatment, to tell him about her arrest, despite having agreed to do so. The
  Rev Sue Parfitt, 83 Retired priest Parfitt, from Henbury in Bristol, was
  arrested on the same day the group was outlawed. She was attending a
  demonstration in Parliament Square in London. She was sitting in a camp chair
  surrounded by other protesters, holding a placard stating her support for
  Palestine Action. As she was led away by police, she called the ban “total
  nonsense” and said it symbolised a “loss of civil liberties in this country”,
  according to the BBC. Deborah Hinton, 81, and Oliver Baines, 74 Hinton is a
  retired magistrate; Baines is a former charity director Hinton and Baines were
  among eight people arrested by Devon and Cornwall officers at a peaceful
  demonstration. “She’s a pillar of the community, so it’s a very brave thing
  for her to have done,” Baines said of Hinton. “Part of why we were protesting
  is that this mission creep of laws against protests is really frightening
  people. This is about freedom of speech,” he told Cornwall Live. He added:
  “We’re not advocating for Palestine Action. We’re resisting the proscription
  of Palestine Action. We’re resisting the politicised use of terror laws to
  suppress a non-violent campaign of sabotage. We’re resisting the
  criminalisation of peaceful protest because it’s already being used to
  intimidate and threaten people just for having Palestine flags.”
