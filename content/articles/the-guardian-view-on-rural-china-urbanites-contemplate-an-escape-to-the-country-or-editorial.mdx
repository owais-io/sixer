  “People gone; buildings empty: this is the fact of daily life in the
  countryside,” lamented the author Liang Hong in her bestselling account China
  in One Village. It was a grim portrait of her home town – its vitality ebbing
  as the forces of modern life drained it of young people, polluted its water,
  exploited its resources and even turned the local school into a pigsty. Its
  quarter of a million sales reflected not just her distinctive writing, but the
  familiarity of the story. As urban China prospered with the Communist party’s
  turn to the market, 350 million villagers migrated to the cities, leaving
  behind increasingly desolate settlements. Now Beijing is promoting “rural
  revitalisation”. State media run a steady stream of articles lauding city
  dwellers who have returned to their home towns to set up cafes or run
  home-stays. The expansion of transport and telecommunications infrastructure
  has allowed rural inhabitants to expand their horizons. First came the “Taobao
  villages”, where at least a 10th of households were using Alibaba’s e-commerce
  platform. More recently, farmers have taken to livestreaming – selling fruit
  or flowers direct to urbanites. The push factors are equally potent.
  Disenchanted urbanites tired of the pressures of city life are seeking to take
  it easier in the countryside, just as hippies in the west rejected their
  parents’ materialistic dreams in the 1960s. Some just aren’t willing to work
  round the clock; others see increasingly scant rewards for doing so. Some are
  turning to rural entrepreneurship because of the high youth unemployment rate.
  And the bulge in working-age citizens that fuelled China’s boom years is now
  becoming a wave of retirees. Migrant remittances were critical to lifting
  rural incomes. But the hukou or household registration system, tying rights to
  benefits and services to your home town, forced working parents to leave their
  children with grandparents – fracturing families and blighting the prospects
  of many in the next generation. Now it prevents them from retiring in the
  cities. China announced in 2020 that it had eradicated extreme poverty, which
  it characterised as entirely rural. That reflected remarkable improvements in
  the lives of tens of millions of people through official programmes – even if
  the means used were often crude, such as forced relocation, and the headline
  target was reached because it was measured on extremely specific criteria. But
  new opportunities should not be overstated. Remote areas are unlikely to
  benefit as those near major roads or close to affluent urban centres are
  doing. Many policies are focused on towns – small by Chinese standards, not so
  by western ones – rather than villages. And disgruntled city dwellers who seek
  a rural idyll may find, as many in the west have, that they cannot make a go
  of it or that the novelty wears off. In fact, projections suggest that the
  rural labour force will continue contracting until 2035, with the urban labour
  force expected to grow. Increasingly, the government’s vision is of
  development being driven by hi-tech industries, while the countryside
  continues to provide cheap labour for the cities when needed and troops for
  the People’s Liberation Army. China needs better social protection and
  services – going beyond its hukou reforms to abolish the system, and investing
  more in education in the villages as well as the cities that house its
  cutting-edge enterprises. Otherwise, most will continue to see the countryside
  as a place to leave behind.
