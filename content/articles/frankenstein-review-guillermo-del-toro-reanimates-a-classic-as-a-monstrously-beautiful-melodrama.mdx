  beautiful melodrama

  Guillermo del Toro has created a movie about a grotesquely unnatural attempt
  to make a human being shocking in his physical strangeness … but that’s enough
  about his film version of Pinocchio. Now Del Toro has written and directed a
  bombastic but watchable new version of Mary Shelley’s great novel and makes of
  it a stately melodrama, starring Oscar Isaac as the anatomist and passionate
  freethinker Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creature: no passé
  neck-bolts or big fringey forehead, of course, and if you compare him with
  portrayals by other actors – Boris Karloff, Peter Boyle, Robert De Niro – he
  is, for all the picturesque prosthetic scars, the nearest this iconic figure
  has come to being a bit of a hottie. It’s an epic bromance between scientist
  and monster, both of whom speak with plummy British accents, the monster’s one
  having a touch of John Hurt in The Elephant Man. The visual style of the movie
  is utterly distinctive and unmistakably that of Del Toro: a series of lovely,
  intricate images, filigreed with infinitesimally exact cod-period detail; deep
  focus but also strangely depthless, like hi-tech stained glass or illustrated
  plates in a Victorian tome; pictures whose luxurious beauty underscores the
  film’s reverence for the source material and for itself, but which for me
  impedes the energy of horror. For all the guignol, this movie is not going to
  risk actual bad taste, unlike the brilliant and far more interesting film on
  the Frankensteinian theme: Yorgos Lanthimos’s Poor Things. Heartsinkingly, Del
  Toro will insist on making his monster more of a supernatural daemon,
  resistant to bullets. Although I have to concede the ingenuity and verve with
  which Del Toro pulls off a storytelling switch to the creature’s own point of
  view, allowing him to narrate his own experiences after escaping
  Frankenstein’s lab: absurd, and yet that shift is the lightning-flash that
  jolts the movie into some semblance of life. As a boy, highly strung Victor is
  abused by his cruel disciplinarian father (Charles Dance), a renowned
  physician whose choleric temper inspires Victor to surpass the old man – to
  rise up against his creator, in fact. As a brilliant young physician himself,
  Frankenstein scandalises Edinburgh’s medical establishment with his godless
  post-galvanic belief that a human being can be created (and death cheated) by
  applying an electric charge to a gruesome assemblage of scavenged body parts.
  Hothead Victor is tolerated by his affectionate younger brother William (Felix
  Kammerer), to whose fiancee Elizabeth (Mia Goth) Victor is attracted, but who
  sees through Victor’s arrogance and essential coldness. It is Elizabeth’s
  wealthy arms manufacturer uncle Harlander (Christoph Waltz) who offers to
  bankroll Frankenstein’s artificial man project, which in fact is to be a
  single dead body salvaged from the field of battle, a gentle giant who is at
  first transfixed by this brave new world that Frankenstein has brought him
  into, but then hurt by Frankenstein’s cold impatience. As for Waltz’s
  mysterious, sinister, twinkle-eyed gentleman, he says airily that in return
  for paying for all this, he might possibly require “a favour of some sort”.
  Uh, oh … I wish that Mia Goth’s character had been given more to do here: her
  presence was like Mia Wasikowska’s in Del Toro’s very interesting and
  underrated Du Maurier-esque fantasy Crimson Peak. She has one rather excellent
  scene, atypical in its playful comedy, in which Frankenstein secretly follows
  Elizabeth to church, impishly ducks into a confession box on the priest’s side
  and grinningly hears her whispered confession: the sin of anger, it seems, as
  she resents this arrogant man Dr Victor Frankenstein who goads her in
  conversation … and yet she is clearly affected by him. A more comically minded
  film-maker might have spun that scene out a little longer: Del Toro ends it
  almost immediately. Goth’s contribution ventilates the drama. Finally,
  inevitably, at the end of the protracted tale, we get to the question of which
  of the two is the “real” monster. The answer, in this high-minded and
  eventually rather sanctified romance, would appear to be – neither of them. •
  Frankenstein screened at the Venice film festival.
