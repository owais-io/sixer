  The Women’s Rugby World Cup will make a glitzy start on Friday night in front
  of a global TV audience, but a Guardian survey of the 16 competing nations has
  discovered the brutal financial reality for many of the players. Half of the
  32-strong Samoa squad are raising funds to cover the costs of their mortgages
  and household bills while taking part in the tournament in England, according
  to one of their players, Nina Foaese, a 36-year-old mother of three. World
  Rugby covers the costs of flights and accommodation for all teams during the
  competition, but while Samoa are giving players allowances they do not have
  contracts in place. Foaese, who works as a support youth worker, said: “It was
  overwhelming, I didn’t expect the donations I have received. I was truly
  grateful and surprised about how much people wanted to sponsor me because I
  have never done something like this before.” Foaese said fundraising came into
  her mind as soon as she heard of her selection for the World Cup. “Our team
  had spoken about what everyone was going to do to help support ourselves
  individually. “I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it, but [someone said] you
  might need help living-wise and to make sure the kids were sorted while I was
  away.” The financial reality among the other teams is a mixed picture. The
  four home nations all have contracts in place. England’s 32 deals range from
  £39,000 to £48,000 and players receive £1,500 per game. Wales pay £23,000 to
  £30,000 for 37 players and Scotland £18,000 to £27,000. Ireland have 37
  contracts in the region of £15,000 to £30,000. New Zealand, the defending
  champions, have 45 full‑time contracts, which vary from NZ$50,000 to NZ$70,000
  (approximately £21,900-£30,600). The Black Ferns players also receive NZ
  $2,000 per week in assembly fees during tournaments and other benefits such as
  life and trauma insurance. Canada, who are among the favourites, do not have
  fixed contracts, but pay their players per tournament and have equal pay with
  the men’s team. A Canadian competing in all competitions this year would
  expect to receive CAN$12,000 (£6,400). Australia have 46 contracts, which
  range from A$15,000 to $70,000 (£7,200-£33,600) and players are paid per day
  in camp so that, if they are selected for all squads, they can boost their
  earnings by A$15,000. USA have contracted 38 players from April to the end of
  September and South Africa have 52 contracts. Brazil’s team of 32 all have
  contracts, but in different variations including sevens deals and contracts
  until after the Rugby World Cup. Some are also paid by a professional
  Brazilian club, Melina. Italy have 25 contracts, with 17 on a full-time basis,
  worth £20,000 each. Four part-timers earn £15,000 and four are on scholarships
  worth £9,000. Japan are in a similar situation to Samoa with no player
  contracts, but do provide daily allowances. There is a win bonus system for
  the tournament results too. Spain, France and Fiji were contacted for
  information but did not reply to requests. It is understood that 32 Spanish
  players have been given short-term bursaries to support the team financially
  at the tournament.
