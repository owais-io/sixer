  A professional trucker who had a hand in saving a California abduction victim
  while driving through Tennessee – and recording key video evidence with his
  windshield camera – recently earned recognition as an “angel” of the US’s
  highways, according to officials. Ron Ross, who drives for MCK Trucking in
  Madison, Alabama, is at the center of the dramatic story, which has seized
  attention in media circles dedicated to unearthing uplifting news stories. He
  was parked at a rest area along Interstate 40 in rural west Tennessee near the
  city of Jackson in February when he noticed a young woman running barefoot
  with her shoes in her hand. She ran about a quarter of a mile and dived into
  the woods while a man chased after her, according to what Ross, of Newport,
  Tennessee, said in a US Truckload Carriers Association (TCA) news release. “I
  thought in my head: ‘Something’s not right about that,’” Ross said. “It scared
  me.” Ross dialed 911 to call for emergency help. A nearby Tennessee highway
  patrol arrived within five minutes, and the woman was rescued, the TCA said. A
  camera on Ross’s windshield recorded video of the scene that he turned over to
  police. From speaking with law enforcement, Ross understood the kidnapped
  young woman had been brought from California, and investigators believed the
  video was “solid evidence to use in the prosecution of the abductor”, the
  TCA’s news release said. “I asked another truck driver who was there: ‘Did I
  just save that girl’s life?’” read a statement from Ross cited in the press
  release. “I hope I did.” The transportation safety director at MCK, David
  Wheeler, told the TCA that his company encourages its drivers “to say
  something if they see something”. “MCK is grateful to have a driver like Ron
  who makes a difference in the world,” Wheeler said in a statement. The TCA
  since 1997 has administered its so-called highway angels program that
  recognizes truck drivers who display kindness, courtesy and courage while on
  duty. Ross was designated a TCA highway angel at the end of June, according to
  the organization.
