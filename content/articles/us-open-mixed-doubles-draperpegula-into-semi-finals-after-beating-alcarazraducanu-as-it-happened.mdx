  After months of discussion and anticipation, the doubles partnership between
  Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz came and went in the blink of an eye in front
  of a well‑populated Arthur Ashe Stadium. Righto, that’s us for today. Thanks
  for your company; join us again tomorrow for the semis and final. They’ve been
  really good, long-time mates delighted to be involved. Next for them: the
  defending champs, Errani/Vavassori. Shelton somehow sends long his return of a
  65mph second serve from Collins and that’s 5-2; she then grabs hold of the
  next rally, which Harrison finishes with a commanding overhead from on top of
  the net. Four match points for the alternates… Townsend/Shelton break back
  then are broken again, and at 4-1 4-4-4 (4-2), the alternates are three points
  away. We’ve not had a 10-point beaker yet, but we’re getting a seven-pointer
  because Collins has held. If Townsend/Shelton take it, though, we’re in
  business … but theyre mini-broken immediately. On Armstrong, it’s now 4-3 3-3,
  Collins/Harrison leading Townsend/Shelton; Townsend, the no 1 player in the
  world, has just held for 3-4 4-3. Pegula says she and Draper had lots of fun;
  he’s glad to be back competing. Then, asked how he’ll prepare for tomorrow and
  barely able to hear Sloane Stephens’ questions, he deadpans “with total
  professionalism”. I wonder how the dubs lads no invited will fee about that; I
  guess they’ll understand, but it bears repeating that there’s something not
  right about the big noises taking opportunity and reward from those who need
  it more, for a bit of fun. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead
  Townsend/Shelton 4-1 2-3. Errani/Vavassori aside, these have been the best
  pair so far, but Swiatek/Ruud, whom the meet in the semis, were also
  impressive. A quick net pum-pum-pum, then Andreeva then clouts a backhand
  winner down the line for 0-30; Draper then battles Medvedev from the back,
  before Pegula interjects at the net to make 30-all. And have a look! From the
  back, he pastes a backhand winner inside-out into the corner, and that’s more
  match points! A double from Andreeva hands over 15-all, then Draper climbs
  into her second serve and catches it too early for her to respond. Pegula,
  though, goes long for 30-all, but at 30-40 her team have match point … saved
  with a decent first serve. From there, Andreeva closes out the hold, so Draper
  will now serve for the match. At 15-30, Pegula needs to find something and
  does, a first serve that allows Draper to intercept Andreeva’s return at net;
  thee two look a cohesive unit and, as I type, Pegula slices an approach and
  Draper again cuts out the riposte with a overhead. The no 1 seeds are a game
  away at 4-0 3-0. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead Townsend/Shelton 4-1 1-1.
  Now then: Medvedev dumps an overhead to cede deuce then, at the end of a long
  rally, Draper rams one at Andreeva, who defends well, but drops just long when
  he goes again. The no 1 seeds lead 4-1 2-0, and are nearing a semi-final
  meeting with Swiatek/Ruud. Medvedev curls a lovely forehand winner down the
  line to put Draper under a bit of pressure at 30-40; my SkyGo then kicks me
  out, so long has been my session, and returns to let me know he’s seen it out.
  On Armstrong, Collins serves out a 4-1 set, then Shelton races through a
  defiant hold. We’re still on serve on Armstrong, Collins/Harrison up 2-1. I’m
  not sure who’s doing it, but the co-commentary on that match is really
  technical and insightful; there were signs of improvement at Wimbledon, but
  tennis has a long way to go to catch up with other sports in terms of depth of
  analysis. Anyroad, Townsend is broken and the alternates lead 3-1; they’re
  having a decent day. It’s quickly 0-40 and when Medvedev hoists from the back,
  he misses the baseline! This set is disappearing quickly, but Draper botches
  the first chance to make it official by netting a volley then, at 40-30, he
  and Pegula go for the same ball at the net after good work from both their
  opponents. At deuce, though, a really fun rally ends when Medvedev goes long,
  Draper and Pegula both at the back, and they take the first set 4-1. Draper
  looks like he could become a really good doubles player – obviously he’s got
  the serve, but his net-play and coverage is also really good. Pegula
  consolidates the break and that’s 3-1. Pegula/Draper make 15-40 and the latter
  gets a look at Andreeva’s second serve. She goes body, pretty effectively, and
  Medvedev ends a rally the two of them dominated, before a terrific get from
  Andreeva, after a fine return from Draper, allows him to spank an overhead
  winner … no it’s wide!; the no 1 seeds lead 2-1, with a break. On Armstrong,
  Harrison holds, and Shelton looks poised to at 40-0 … and does. Off we go on
  Armstrong, Harrison to serve. Both courts looks pretty well populated now,
  which makes sense given school holidays and free entry. Draper finds himself
  under a bitta pressha at 30-all, so service-winners his way out of it, then
  Andreeeva swats a return wide and we’re at 1-1. Andreeva slaps one at Pegula
  and does she suppress a grin after raising a hand? I can’t be sure, but I can
  see why she might. It makes 40-0, and the love-hold is quickly secured. We’re
  away on Ashe, Medvedev serving. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison return, with
  Townsend/Shelton following them. Two lefties present a very different
  challenge to Bencic/Zverev, and Shelton was close to his bouncing best in the
  first match; if he hits that level, his team’ll be hard to beat. We should at
  this point remind ourselves, just before we tuck into some delicious and, I
  guess, surprise sport, that with the exception of the holders,
  Errani/Vavassori, the best doubles teams in the world were excluded from this
  event. I wonder if, next term, they increase the size of this competition to
  get more of them in; that’d be my guess. We’re ready to rumble again on Ashe,
  Andreeva/Medvedev returning with Pegula/Draper right behind them. Both were
  excellent in their first match, and this is going to be a lot of fun,
  especially for 22.08 on a Tuesday night. The winners play Swiatek/Ruud in the
  semis. Collins says she and Harrison have known each other since they were 14,
  so know each other’s games really well; his dad has been her coach for 20
  years. Harrison says Collins’ singles ranking got them in, and now she’s got
  them through the first match. A brilliant win for the alternates. Harrison was
  particularly good there; it’s almost as if he’s played a lot of doubles. Next
  for them: Townsend/Shelton. Wow! Harrison leans back and loops a ridiculous
  forehand into the corner and Bencic can’t get it! That makes 15-40 and two
  match points… On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead 4-0 4-3, Bencic serving for
  she and Zverev to stay in the competition. Danilovic will be feeling those
  consecutive doubles she served at deuce for a long, long time. Next for the
  winners: Pegula/Draper, about 10 minutes from now. A longer rally, Djokovc
  looking likeliest to end it … then he nets a volley above his head. That’s
  40-0 and three match points… Seven points on the spin for Andreeva/Medvedev,
  the latter holding to love. They lead 1-0 3-4-3, momentum having switched in
  the last five or so minutes and, as I type, Djokovic nets with his opponents
  charging about in chaos for 0-30. A fine Medvedev return then secures 0-40,
  before he runs up to the net, of all the things, to pat away a volley.
  Andreeva will shortly serve for the match while, on Armstrong, it’s 3-3 in the
  second, the first to Harrison/Collins. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead
  Bencic/Zverev 4-0 3-2; Zverev will now serve to keep his team in the match.
  Andreeva/Medvedev get to 30-all, but then the latter overhits a forehand down
  the line with plenty at which to aim; it hands over set point, only for
  Danilovic to double. Here comes another … and she doubles again! Ach, you feel
  for her, the break handed back at 2-4 3-2. Djokovic does well at the net to
  make 0-30, then Andreeva dumps one and must now defend three break points+1.
  And she cannot, a body-return from Danilovic’s too much, thereby converting
  the first. She’ll now serve for the second set at 3-1. Back on Ashe, Djokovic
  holds; he and Danilovic lead 2-1 in the second having lost the first. I’d not
  be surprised if this becomes our first match to go all the way. My eyes were
  elsewhere when Zverev was broken, but it’s hard to believe it happened in this
  context; there aren’t many better servers in the world. He goes again at 0-4
  0-1 and holds to love; he and Bencic are on the board. Andreeva, who plays
  doubles at slams, strokes a backhand return down the line for a winner and
  15-all, but from there Danilovic serves out for a 1-0 second-set lead.
  Medvedev holds easily enough, so he and Andreeva take the first set 4-2. This
  is a close encounter, though … unlike the one on Armstrong, Harrison
  dominating the court such that he and Collins lead Bencic/Zverev 4-0. For
  them, I guess, this is a really big deal – a chance to do something special,
  not a fun and lucrative warmup for the main event. Andreeva/Medvedev make
  30-40 on the Djokovic delivery; a second-serve ace down the T averts the
  immediate danger, but then Medvedev pings a forehand down the middle and
  between his two opponents to secure the break and a 3-2 lead. The set is on
  his racket. Another swift hold on Ashe, Danilovic/Djokovic now up 2-1,
  whereupon the latter pastes a forehand winner down the line for 0-15. Then,
  after missing a backhand, the latter does really well at net to make 15-30,
  and at 30-all, Djokovic lobs Medvedev twice in a row before punishing a
  further forehand winner down the line for break point. Andfreeva saves it,
  which takes us to deuce, and from there, Medvedev secures the hold for 2-2. On
  Armstrong, it’s a good start for the new entrants, Collins/Harrison breaking
  Bencic/Zverev for 2-0; Harrison, a dubs specialist, is showing what that
  entails. “Not sure where the Djokovic mixed stat came from,” alerts Alex
  Hughes. “He withdrew injured before the mixed doubles bronze medal match in
  Tokyo…” I guess they may have said at a grand slam and I missed it, watching
  my other screen. Reminder: Collins/Harrison are replacing Sinner/Siniakova.
  Good net-work from Danilovic has Andreeva flapping, but Medvedev still holds
  to 15 and we’re at 1-1; on Armstrong, the match has just started. At 40-30
  Danilovic nets an overhead, and with Medvedev returning, Djokivics serve is in
  peril. But he too nets, meaning the Serbian team lead 1-0. We learn that
  Djokivic has played one mixed doubles match in his career, 20 years ago. But
  he’s ready to serve here, clad in the kind of sky-blue collared shirt my dad
  was wearing in 1982. Our next sets of teams are out. Good. Townsend thanks the
  crowd, noting that Shelton brings “a certain energy” from her, before
  chastising the crowd for being a little dry and asking for more next match.
  Shelton says it’s easy for him, Townsend is the no 1 mixed doubles player in
  the world so she makes the rules and he’s along for the ride. Shelton, says
  Townsend, is “the vibe coordinator”, they work well together, and, interjects
  Shelton, “we’re just having fun”. Next on Amstrong: Collins/Harrison v
  Bencic/Zverev. They look a proper partnership. Next on Ashe:
  Danilovic/Djokovic v Andreeva/Medvedev It’s now 5-1 on Armstrong;
  Townsend/Shelton are nearly there. Draper says it’s a pleasure to play with
  Pegula as it is to face Raducanu and Alcaraz; Pegula thanks the crowd for
  showing up and creating a fun atmosphere even if it took a couple of
  miraculous Alcaraz shots to get them going. They plan to hang out and chill
  during their break. Townsend/Shelton immediately secure then lose then secure
  a mini-break; they lead 3-1. A banger of a point to finish a really fun game,
  Draper taking charge to eventually punish a forehand winner down the line.
  …but a forehand winner from Raducanu saves it, making deuce while, on
  Armstrong, Rune holds for a second-set breaker. A terrific shot from Pegula,
  who spots Alacaraz moving inside so sticks a winner into the tramlines, raises
  match point… At 0-15, Alcaraz misses a chance for 0-30, then Draper intercedes
  at net for 30-15. On Armstrong, by the way, Rune is serving at 2-2 3-4, so to
  stay in the match; anyone got any spare eyes? Draper is the best player on
  Ashe and by far; he and Pegula make 15-30 on the Raducanu serve and he’s into
  net like an assassin to stick away a volley to raise two but really three
  match points. But the first two are quickly saved, the second with an ace, so
  here comes the deciding point, Alacaraz doing enough at net to force Pegula to
  serve for it at 4-2 3-2. On Armstrong, Townsend/Shelton lead 4-2 3-3. Draper
  is playing really well and he holds to love; at 4-2 3-1, he and Pegula are a
  game away. On Armstrong, Anisimova/Rune trail 2-4 2-3, meaning the former must
  now serve to stay in the match. Alcaraz hasn’t been at it today and is soon
  down 30-40 on serve, Raducanu butchering an overhead to confirm the break.
  It’s a long way back for them from here, Pegula/Draper up a set and a break at
  4-2 2-1. . Shelton’s on one here, ridiculous net-play making 30-15; he and
  Townsend are having a right laugh out there, quickly securing their gold for
  4-1 2-1, as Alcaraz races beyond the sideline to shove a forehand around the
  net-post with Raducanu having already given up the point. They still trail
  40-15, though, and from there Draper sticks away a winner to give he and
  Pegula a 4-2 1-1 lead. Rune is forced to deuce on serve and the break-back is
  immediate, Townsend and Shelton celebrating in grand style. Meantime on Ashe,
  Raducanu is forced to deuce, Alcaraz commanding at the net to secure their
  hold for 2-4 1-0. Draper makes 30-15, then cunningly guides a forehand line
  with Alcaraz expecting him to go cross, but a netted forehand then makes
  things tight. And have a look! Alcaraz has been quiet so far, but fine work at
  the net earns deuce … then he ruins it by putting too much gas on a forehand.
  The first set goes to Pegula/Draper 4-2 and, while that’s going on,
  Anisimova/Rune break Townsend/Shelton at the first time of asking in the
  second to trail 2-4 1-0. And they only need two, Rune volleying long – his
  hands aren’t as hard as Khachanov’s but you’d never call them soft – so the
  Americans lead by a set to love. Alcaraz holds in short order, so Draper must
  indeed serve for 1-0, while Townsend/Shelton hold three break and therefore
  set points over Anisimova/Rune. Very quickly, it’s 2-2 on Armstrong, Rune then
  finishing a terrific net-exchange for 0-15, as Pegula swats a backhand wide
  for 30-all and pressure. But then Alcaraz nets a volley he shouldn’t and
  clouts a forehand wide, meaning a 1-3 first-set deficit; if he holds, Draper
  will have a chance to serve for it. And on Armstrong, Shelton holds for 3-2.
  Anisimova/Rune break back immediately to trail Townsend/Shelton 1-2, while
  Raducanu holds to keep her and Alcaraz in set one – but they’ll need to break
  Pegula next up to have a realistic chance of saving the st. Quickly, though, a
  double makes 0-30; Townsend retrieves for 30-all whole Draper holds to give
  him and Pegula a 2-0 lead over Raducanu/Alcaraz. Back on Armstrong, Shelton is
  dominating, rousting a forehand from the back that makes 15-40, and when Rune
  then goes long, the American pair lead 2-0. The set feels done and if Townsend
  holds next up, it will be as good as. Pegula/Draper race to 0-40, which in
  this format means four break points. But they only need two, Draper hooking a
  forehand winner to secure an advantage that, in this format, could well prove
  decisive in the set. Both matches are under way, Shelton holding in rapid time
  while Pegula/Draper make 0-30 on the Alcaraz serve. What on earth is going on
  with Jack Draper’s shorts? I’ll try and find a pic in the fullness of time,
  but he seems to be keeping spare balls in front pockets? Oh, and our teams are
  out on Ashe now, too. This match should be an absolute jazzer and I’m really
  excited to see how a rested Draper and in-form Raducanu pull up. We’re about
  to start knocking up on Armstrong. Townsend/Shelton have the better doubles
  pedigree and i’d expect them to take care of Anisimova/Rune. It’s not clear
  when we’ll get going again, but it should be soon, as the earliest time the
  second set of matches could start on Armstrong was 6.30pm BST and it’s now
  7.45. Errani is delighted she has the opportunity to play more tennis; at 38,
  I’m not surprised. Vavassori says sticking together is their strength, and
  their opponents were playing really well, so it was tough. Otherwise, they’ll
  be focused tomorrow, and they’re doing it for the specialists. Next on
  Armstrong: Townsend/Shelton v Anisimova/Rune (4). It is, though, good to see
  Muchova, who’s had terrible trouble with a wrist injury, enjoying her tennis.
  She’s a fantastic player and I can’t wait to see how she does in the singles.
  And are head to head once again. Vavassori was sensational there, and the
  champs will take some stopping. Errani/Vavassori have turned the breaker
  around and now have match point… Next on Ashe: Pegula/Draoer (1) v
  Raducanu/Alcaraz. They’ve been extremely impressive and are into the last
  four. It might take Errani/Vavassori to beat them, if anyone can beat them.
  Amazing behaviour from Vavassori, who somehow leaps and contorts to deflect
  back a volley, then hits two more and regains the break at 3-4. That is
  doubles and Rublev knows it, offering a hug at the net. Muchova/Rublev rush to
  a 4-1 lead; looking to serve out the match, Ruud is down 15-30, but an errant
  return levels the game, leaving he and Swiatek two points from the semis.
  While all that was going on, Swiatek/Ruud raised two break points at 4-1 2-2;
  the first is saved … and the second, McNally with the leaping overhead. But at
  deuce, there’s still another go, and Ruud hooks a forehand into the corner for
  a winner that means his team are a hold away form the last four. On Armstrong,
  we’re playing a second-set breaker. …and it’s another belter, Muchova and
  Rublev all over the place and crossing, yet somehow find a way to stop in the
  point before winning it for the hold when Vaavassori nets. And what a
  celebration they enjoy; great stuff. They trail by a set to love but lead 4-3,
  Errani now serving to keep her team in the set. Now then: Errani/Vavassori win
  a wicked rat-a-tat-tat rally at net, make 30-all on the Muchova serve, then
  win another sharp exchange when Vavassori is too strong at net for deuce. Huge
  point coming up… Swiatek, who only arrived in New York at 12.50 this morning
  after winning Cincy, opens shoulders to unleash an inside-out backhand winner
  with both she and Ruud pinned back on the baseline. A proper dubs team don’t
  let them off the hook there, but at 40-30, Switek nets from close to it;
  that’s a missed opportunity, and McNally/Musetti trail 1-4 2-1. It’s now 2-2
  in set two on Armstrong, and worth noting that we’ve not had a deciding set so
  far today. Rublev and Muchova, though, are doing their best to maker that
  happen, while Ruud holds for 4-1 1-1, he and Swiatek once again the dominant
  pair. I’m not sure what McNally/Musetti have for them. …and Musetti takes it.
  He and McNally trail by a set to love but lead 1-0 in the second. From 30-all,
  Muchova does superbly to hold, a forehand winner then a service winner
  securing a 2-1 lead in set two. Meanwhile, on Ashe, Swiatek/Ruud have 30-40 on
  the Musetti serve; the Norwegian nets a forehand when well in the rally, but
  here comes the deciding point… A hold apiece opens set two on Armstrong, where
  Errani/Vavassori lead 1-0 1-1. It’s hard to see how they lose from here. And
  now it’s Swiatek with the crucial intervention, leaning across to whack a
  volley at McNally with Ruud serving at 30-all; from there, they close out to
  take the first set. Of the new teams, so far theirs looks the best.
  Swiatek/Ruud earn break point at 30-40 whereupon the Norwegian then takes
  over, a fine return backed up with a booming forehand; he’ll now serve for the
  first set at 3-1. Vavassori serves out, so he and Errani lead Muchova/Rublev
  by a set to love. They look pretty good. Back on Ashe, at deuce, a chance for
  McNally/Musetti … but the former returns long and the chance is gone,
  Swiatek/Ruud leading 2-1. Vavassori is dynamite at the net and he stretches
  across it to stick away a volley for 15-30 and it’s quickly 15-40; Muchova,
  serving, then whips her +1 down the line and wide, meaning the champs lead
  3-1. Vavassori will now serve for the first set, a pretty smart turnaround
  given he was broken in its first game. Swiatek/Ruud and McNally/Musetti both
  hold so we’re at 1-1, while Errani does likewise for 2-1, and that could be
  telling: she is not known for her power, so her team’s major weak point can no
  longer hinder them in this set. Brilliant net-coverage from Vavassori earns a
  chance to break back immediately at 30-4,0 and when Rublev nets, he and Errani
  have it. They’ve by far the most at stake here: this is their bread and
  butter, the money is much bigger for them, and they’re repping for dubs
  specialists. They’re level with Muchova/Rublev at 1-1 in the first. On Ashe,
  McNally/Musetti and Swiatek/Ruud are out and knocking up. We’re away again on
  Armstrong, Rublev raising break point with an overhead then returning hard;
  Errani moves out of the road but the ball is good, so he and Muchova lead the
  champs 1-0 with a break. On Armstrong, Errani/Vavassori and Muchova/Rublev are
  back with us. This should be a really fun contest. Swiatek says she’s played
  Ruud in the United Cup so has a good idea of where to be on the court; Ruud
  notes that Swiatek is on the winning train and he’s just jumping on. They’ll
  now share notes on McNally and Musetti, the match due on court in a matter of
  minutes. The winners look a good team and meet McNally/Musetti shortly. Rublev
  says he doesn’t know what he’s doing, he’s just trying to serve well. Muchova,
  though, is a good doubles player with the dexterity and power to become an
  even better one. They’re second-favourites for their quarter and rightly so,
  but they’ll give Errani/Vavssori a better game than Rybakina/Fritz did. Keys
  holds serve, forcing Swiatek/Ruuud to serve for the match at 4-1 3-2. That was
  never really in doubt. Muchova/Rublev meet Errani/Vavassori in the last eight
  – and in a few minutes’ time. News reaches me that, in the locker room last
  week, Fritz said there was no chance he’d lose to a doubles player in mixed
  doubles. Penny for em, Taylor old mate. Oh Maddy. Regular readers of this blog
  will know she’s a favourite – Muchova too – and down 15-40, she sends down a
  double, missing the box by a way on her second go. Swiatek/Ruud lead 4-1 10
  while, on Armatrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 in their
  second-set breaker, so are three points from victory. As I mentioned earlier,
  it’s $50,000 to show, with $50,000 more on offer for the first-round winners.
  Mucholva holds, so we’re playing a second-set breaker on Armstrong;
  Williams/Opelka have to win it to stay in the competition and it’s first to
  seven. Coach Calv, who as a Wimbledon and Aussie Open winner, knows a thing or
  90,423 about doubles, notes that Rybakina/Frtiz didn’t even manage a break
  point against Errani/Vavassori and, with the best will in the world, the
  former is not renowned for her prowess in that aspect of the game. He also
  adds that “Vava is a great lad” and it’s clear Errani is too. Venus finds
  herself serving at 15-30 and when Muchova volleys between her and Opelka,
  she’s down two break points. The first is saved when Rublev sends a forehand
  wide, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point at deuce …
  Opelka putting away and overhead with typical venom. Muchova will now serve
  for a breaker. A terrific forehand from Ruud, looped down the line, raises
  three set points at 3-1, and an ace means he and Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0;
  on Armstrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 3-3. Opelka holds so he
  and Venus lead Muchova/Rublev 3-2 having lost set one; Swiatek holds, so she
  and Ruud lead Keys/Tiafoe 3-0. I love how businesslike the Pole is – there
  aren’t many more focused competitors in any sport. Up 0-40, Swiatek and Ruud
  go for the same ball, clashing rackets, and we wind up at deuce, a Tiafoe
  double handing over the game after all that hard work saving it. The no 3
  seeds lead 2-0; Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opela 4-2 1-2 on serve. A hold
  apiece opens set two on Armstrong, but Muchova/Rublev look the defter, more
  natural pair; I’d be surprised if they lost this. On Ashe. Ruud/Swiatek lead
  Keys/Tiafoe 1-0. Keys and Tiafoe come out linking arms – they’re great mates,
  which is always nice to see. I’ve not a clue what to expect from this match,
  but I’m fascinated to see how Swiatek pulls up having only just won
  Cincinnati. We’re ready to get going, the winners to meet McNally/Musetti. Two
  mahoosive Rublev forehands, one cross then a winner down the line, make 30-0,
  and terrific net-play, from him and Muchova, secure a 4-2 first set. Opelka
  holds in short order, meaning Rublev will now serve for the set. He’s not
  often broken, and it seems unlikely the pair he’s facing have what it takes to
  make that happen. Rublev nets a volley just as he and Muchova take over the
  rally and face break-back point; Venus nets a return for deuce, but with no
  advantage, she and Opelka have another shot at it. But they can’t take it,
  Venus butchering her volley, and Muchova/Rublev lead 3-1. Back on Armstrong,
  Venus is serving at deuce … and she’s broken for 1-2. It’s a long way back
  from here, Muchova and Rublev both reliable servers. McNally says she got a
  call from her agent telling her she had 30 seconds to decide whether to play
  with Musetti; “Er… yes!” was her response. Musetti explains they spoke this
  morning, decided which side to play, and McNally is a really good player and
  he enjoyed seeing her at net. He thinks they’ve good chemistry on court and is
  looking forward to playing again. He was really stressed serving out, but
  hopes he’ll be better when they come back in an hour to play their quarter.
  Next on Ashe: Swiatek/Ruud (3) v Keys/Tiafoe. The stadium looks pretty full,
  now, by the way, which is good news. As on Armstrong, they’ve seen the better
  doubles players win. The winning pair seemed to really enjoy that, and fully
  deserve their win. A fine backhand winner from Osaka, monstered inside-out,
  earns two break-back points … both saved, but there’ll be a third with no
  advantage, that’s also match point. And we’re away again on Ashe,
  Williams/Opelka holding for 1-0. We’re still on serve in the second, but
  McNally/Musetti look the likelier. With no deuces and four-game sets, though,
  things can turn on almost nothing. More importantly, though, what do we make
  of Osaka’s trainers? Sadly, I’ve no better snap for now, but back on court, a
  Monfils double means she and he are broken; at 5-3 3-2, McNally/Musetti will
  now serve for the match. McNally/Musetti seem to really be enjoying themselves
  and make deuce at 1-0 1-1, but Osaka/Monfils hold to keep their noses in front
  in set two; on Armstrong, our new teams emerge. On Ashe, we’re 1-1 on set two,
  McNally/Musetti by one set to love. Next on Armstrong: Williams/Opelka v
  Muchová/Rublev. Errani is delighted, saying she loves playing with Vavassori
  and thinks she did well today. Vavassori notes that though their opponents are
  great, he and his partner know how to play together and they’re doing it for
  all the doubles players who aren’t competing. Biggup. I really enjoyed
  Errani’s celebration there, butting heads with Vavassori; these two aren’t
  just dubs partners, they’re best mates, and it’s beautiful to watch. The
  doubles team won that easily enough, their cohesion and deftness too much for
  their powerful but one-dimensional opponents. On Ashe, McNally/Musetti
  eventually serve out and lead Osaka/Monfils by one set to love. Frankly: good
  Of the four out on Ashe, McNally, the least famous, is also the best doubles
  player. And it’s showing, Musetti pointing at her after good work allows them
  to make 30-15; meanwhile, Errani/Vavassori are up 30-0, two points away from
  victory. And this time, Musetti nails his forehand winner so, at 4-3, McNally
  now serve for the set while, on Ashe, Errani/Vavassori have just botched two
  break points at 4-2 2-2, but at deuce have a third coming up … which they
  take. At 4-2 3-2, they’ll now serve for the match. …then a third, so we’ll now
  have a deciding point, Osaka serving. …and two are saved… A Musetti forehand
  winner down the line catches Monfils in no-man’s land; it’s almost like he’s
  not a doubles specialist. So at 0-40, McNally/Musetti have three break points…
  …and Musetti double faults! Two set-points burned, and it’s 3-3 in the first;
  if we get to 4-4 we’ll have a breaker. On Armstrong, it’s 2-1 Rybakina/Fritz
  in set two, the first taken by Errani/Vavassori. Excellent net-play from
  McNally earns 30-15, but though Musetti seems to have secured set-point with a
  terrific backhand, Osaka/Monfils stick in the rally and eventually the Italian
  loses an overhead in the sun and nets. They do then make set point, but this
  time McNall nets a volley, so here comes the one-point settler…
  McNally/Musetti break Osaka/Monfils – a wild forehand from Osaka raises hands
  over the opportunity – so at 3-2, Musetti will now serve for the set.
  Vavassori serves out easily enough, so he and Errani lead Fritz/Rybakina by a
  set to love. On Ashe, meantime, Musetti has just put away an overhead at the
  net to save break point. He and McNally are level with Osaka/Monfils at 2-2 in
  the first. Fritz holds, forcing Vavassori to serve for the first set. Thinking
  more about all this, I’m also missing the prospect of an epic – in this
  format, they’re simply impossible. And, if you’re wondering if that’s even
  possible in dubs, check out – for example – the Wimbledon and Aussie Open
  finals won my Patten/Heliovaara. It just doesn’t get better than that. I
  should say, I’m not opposed to tweaking doubles to entice crowds in. I’m just
  opposed to lozzing doubles teams while confiscating some of their income. The
  crowds, by the way, are OK but nothing especially exciting. And, as I type,
  Fritz plays the kind of backhand down the line that might work well in
  singles. But Vavassori is there to cut it off with a volley, the hold follows,
  and the champs are a game away from set one while, on Ashe, Osaka holds to
  give her and Monfils a 2-1 lead over McNally/Musetti. Quicksmart,
  Errani/Vavassori hold for 1-1 and will now look to put pressure on Rybakina,
  excellence from Errani force another break point … which this time they take.
  They lead 2-1 in a race to four; on Ashe, it’s 1-1. First up, Fritz/Rybakina
  are down 30-40, the former serving. But Vavassori nets with plenty of court at
  which to aim, meaning a deciding point … settled by a booming Fritz forehand.
  I do not think this’ll be the last time I type those words or variations of
  them over the next fortnight. Meantime on Ashe, Monfils holds, so he and Osaka
  lead McNally/Musetti 1-0. Righto, I’ve found Errani/Vavassori v
  Rybakina/Fritz. Obviously I’m impartial, but come on the champs. Our first two
  pairs are out on Ashe; I’m not yet certain if we can watch Armstrong too. The
  last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will be best of three sets, but first
  to four games not six. If a game goes to deuce, the winners of the next point
  take it – there’s no advantage. If a match is level at a set apiece, a
  10-point match tiebreak will settle it. Breaking: Danielle Collins and
  Christian Harris replace Sinner/Siniakova. On which point, the reason for the
  TBD below is that Jannik Sinner, who retired ill when 5-0 down to Carlos
  Alcaraz in the Cincinnati final, has pulled out. I can’t lie, I’m buzzing that
  we’ve got two extra days of banging tennis. This competition should just
  feature the best mixed doubles pairings, not the best singles players who can
  be arsed. Email! “I agree, its money-fuelled tokenism and could cause the end
  of doubles as we know it at the major tournaments, says Andrew Benton. “Or, it
  might be the start of a doubles revival, from which the specialists will
  benefit particularly – at least people will be watching these matches as they
  feature the rich and famous, and who knows where that extra interest and
  investment could lead. Well, probably nowhere. But it’s a bit like the
  Hundred.” I disagree it’s like the Hundred as that isn’t taking a major
  tournament away from those who play the event best. I also don’t believe
  doubles needs gimmicks – it just needs to be marketed and respected properly.
  Henry Patten was really good on this when I interviewed him in May. The
  winners – we’ll know who they are tomorrow – will earn $1m, fives times more
  than went to last year’s champions. According to BBC, appearance fees are
  north of $50,000, or in other words, the players involved are competing to get
  paid and to prepare for their singles campaigns, not because they’re motivated
  to win a grand slam. I’ve not the slightest clue how the seeding works, but
  it’s worth noting that Errani/Vavassori, included as a sop to sporting merit –
  they’re the defending champions – have not been so honoured. Ashe Naomi

  for decades – to make a living. So confiscating a huge competition from them,

  best of it, I guess.

After months of discussion and anticipation, the doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz came and went in the blink of an eye in front of a well‑populated Arthur Ashe Stadium. Righto, that’s us for today. Thanks for your company; join us again tomorrow for the semis and final. They’ve been really good, long-time mates delighted to be involved. Next for them: the defending champs, Errani/Vavassori. Shelton somehow sends long his return of a 65mph second serve from Collins and that’s 5-2; she then grabs hold of the next rally, which Harrison finishes with a commanding overhead from on top of the net. Four match points for the alternates… Townsend/Shelton break back then are broken again, and at 4-1 4-4-4 (4-2), the alternates are three points away. We’ve not had a 10-point beaker yet, but we’re getting a seven-pointer because Collins has held. If Townsend/Shelton take it, though, we’re in business … but theyre mini-broken immediately. On Armstrong, it’s now 4-3 3-3, Collins/Harrison leading Townsend/Shelton; Townsend, the no 1 player in the world, has just held for 3-4 4-3. Pegula says she and Draper had lots of fun; he’s glad to be back competing. Then, asked how he’ll prepare for tomorrow and barely able to hear Sloane Stephens’ questions, he deadpans “with total professionalism”. I wonder how the dubs lads no invited will fee about that; I guess they’ll understand, but it bears repeating that there’s something not right about the big noises taking opportunity and reward from those who need it more, for a bit of fun. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead Townsend/Shelton 4-1 2-3. Errani/Vavassori aside, these have been the best pair so far, but Swiatek/Ruud, whom the meet in the semis, were also impressive. A quick net pum-pum-pum, then Andreeva then clouts a backhand winner down the line for 0-30; Draper then battles Medvedev from the back, before Pegula interjects at the net to make 30-all. And have a look! From the back, he pastes a backhand winner inside-out into the corner, and that’s more match points! A double from Andreeva hands over 15-all, then Draper climbs into her second serve and catches it too early for her to respond. Pegula, though, goes long for 30-all, but at 30-40 her team have match point … saved with a decent first serve. From there, Andreeva closes out the hold, so Draper will now serve for the match. At 15-30, Pegula needs to find something and does, a first serve that allows Draper to intercept Andreeva’s return at net; thee two look a cohesive unit and, as I type, Pegula slices an approach and Draper again cuts out the riposte with a overhead. The no 1 seeds are a game away at 4-0 3-0. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead Townsend/Shelton 4-1 1-1. Now then: Medvedev dumps an overhead to cede deuce then, at the end of a long rally, Draper rams one at Andreeva, who defends well, but drops just long when he goes again. The no 1 seeds lead 4-1 2-0, and are nearing a semi-final meeting with Swiatek/Ruud. Medvedev curls a lovely forehand winner down the line to put Draper under a bit of pressure at 30-40; my SkyGo then kicks me out, so long has been my session, and returns to let me know he’s seen it out. On Armstrong, Collins serves out a 4-1 set, then Shelton races through a defiant hold. We’re still on serve on Armstrong, Collins/Harrison up 2-1. I’m not sure who’s doing it, but the co-commentary on that match is really technical and insightful; there were signs of improvement at Wimbledon, but tennis has a long way to go to catch up with other sports in terms of depth of analysis. Anyroad, Townsend is broken and the alternates lead 3-1; they’re having a decent day. It’s quickly 0-40 and when Medvedev hoists from the back, he misses the baseline! This set is disappearing quickly, but Draper botches the first chance to make it official by netting a volley then, at 40-30, he and Pegula go for the same ball at the net after good work from both their opponents. At deuce, though, a really fun rally ends when Medvedev goes long, Draper and Pegula both at the back, and they take the first set 4-1. Draper looks like he could become a really good doubles player – obviously he’s got the serve, but his net-play and coverage is also really good. Pegula consolidates the break and that’s 3-1. Pegula/Draper make 15-40 and the latter gets a look at Andreeva’s second serve. She goes body, pretty effectively, and Medvedev ends a rally the two of them dominated, before a terrific get from Andreeva, after a fine return from Draper, allows him to spank an overhead winner … no it’s wide!; the no 1 seeds lead 2-1, with a break. On Armstrong, Harrison holds, and Shelton looks poised to at 40-0 … and does. Off we go on Armstrong, Harrison to serve. Both courts looks pretty well populated now, which makes sense given school holidays and free entry. Draper finds himself under a bitta pressha at 30-all, so service-winners his way out of it, then Andreeeva swats a return wide and we’re at 1-1. Andreeva slaps one at Pegula and does she suppress a grin after raising a hand? I can’t be sure, but I can see why she might. It makes 40-0, and the love-hold is quickly secured. We’re away on Ashe, Medvedev serving. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison return, with Townsend/Shelton following them. Two lefties present a very different challenge to Bencic/Zverev, and Shelton was close to his bouncing best in the first match; if he hits that level, his team’ll be hard to beat. We should at this point remind ourselves, just before we tuck into some delicious and, I guess, surprise sport, that with the exception of the holders, Errani/Vavassori, the best doubles teams in the world were excluded from this event. I wonder if, next term, they increase the size of this competition to get more of them in; that’d be my guess. We’re ready to rumble again on Ashe, Andreeva/Medvedev returning with Pegula/Draper right behind them. Both were excellent in their first match, and this is going to be a lot of fun, especially for 22.08 on a Tuesday night. The winners play Swiatek/Ruud in the semis. Collins says she and Harrison have known each other since they were 14, so know each other’s games really well; his dad has been her coach for 20 years. Harrison says Collins’ singles ranking got them in, and now she’s got them through the first match. A brilliant win for the alternates. Harrison was particularly good there; it’s almost as if he’s played a lot of doubles. Next for them: Townsend/Shelton. Wow! Harrison leans back and loops a ridiculous forehand into the corner and Bencic can’t get it! That makes 15-40 and two match points… On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead 4-0 4-3, Bencic serving for she and Zverev to stay in the competition. Danilovic will be feeling those consecutive doubles she served at deuce for a long, long time. Next for the winners: Pegula/Draper, about 10 minutes from now. A longer rally, Djokovc looking likeliest to end it … then he nets a volley above his head. That’s 40-0 and three match points… Seven points on the spin for Andreeva/Medvedev, the latter holding to love. They lead 1-0 3-4-3, momentum having switched in the last five or so minutes and, as I type, Djokovic nets with his opponents charging about in chaos for 0-30. A fine Medvedev return then secures 0-40, before he runs up to the net, of all the things, to pat away a volley. Andreeva will shortly serve for the match while, on Armstrong, it’s 3-3 in the second, the first to Harrison/Collins. On Armstrong, Collins/Harrison lead Bencic/Zverev 4-0 3-2; Zverev will now serve to keep his team in the match. Andreeva/Medvedev get to 30-all, but then the latter overhits a forehand down the line with plenty at which to aim; it hands over set point, only for Danilovic to double. Here comes another … and she doubles again! Ach, you feel for her, the break handed back at 2-4 3-2. Djokovic does well at the net to make 0-30, then Andreeva dumps one and must now defend three break points+1. And she cannot, a body-return from Danilovic’s too much, thereby converting the first. She’ll now serve for the second set at 3-1. Back on Ashe, Djokovic holds; he and Danilovic lead 2-1 in the second having lost the first. I’d not be surprised if this becomes our first match to go all the way. My eyes were elsewhere when Zverev was broken, but it’s hard to believe it happened in this context; there aren’t many better servers in the world. He goes again at 0-4 0-1 and holds to love; he and Bencic are on the board. Andreeva, who plays doubles at slams, strokes a backhand return down the line for a winner and 15-all, but from there Danilovic serves out for a 1-0 second-set lead. Medvedev holds easily enough, so he and Andreeva take the first set 4-2. This is a close encounter, though … unlike the one on Armstrong, Harrison dominating the court such that he and Collins lead Bencic/Zverev 4-0. For them, I guess, this is a really big deal – a chance to do something special, not a fun and lucrative warmup for the main event. Andreeva/Medvedev make 30-40 on the Djokovic delivery; a second-serve ace down the T averts the immediate danger, but then Medvedev pings a forehand down the middle and between his two opponents to secure the break and a 3-2 lead. The set is on his racket. Another swift hold on Ashe, Danilovic/Djokovic now up 2-1, whereupon the latter pastes a forehand winner down the line for 0-15. Then, after missing a backhand, the latter does really well at net to make 15-30, and at 30-all, Djokovic lobs Medvedev twice in a row before punishing a further forehand winner down the line for break point. Andfreeva saves it, which takes us to deuce, and from there, Medvedev secures the hold for 2-2. On Armstrong, it’s a good start for the new entrants, Collins/Harrison breaking Bencic/Zverev for 2-0; Harrison, a dubs specialist, is showing what that entails. “Not sure where the Djokovic mixed stat came from,” alerts Alex Hughes. “He withdrew injured before the mixed doubles bronze medal match in Tokyo…” I guess they may have said at a grand slam and I missed it, watching my other screen. Reminder: Collins/Harrison are replacing Sinner/Siniakova. Good net-work from Danilovic has Andreeva flapping, but Medvedev still holds to 15 and we’re at 1-1; on Armstrong, the match has just started. At 40-30 Danilovic nets an overhead, and with Medvedev returning, Djokivics serve is in peril. But he too nets, meaning the Serbian team lead 1-0. We learn that Djokivic has played one mixed doubles match in his career, 20 years ago. But he’s ready to serve here, clad in the kind of sky-blue collared shirt my dad was wearing in 1982. Our next sets of teams are out. Good. Townsend thanks the crowd, noting that Shelton brings “a certain energy” from her, before chastising the crowd for being a little dry and asking for more next match. Shelton says it’s easy for him, Townsend is the no 1 mixed doubles player in the world so she makes the rules and he’s along for the ride. Shelton, says Townsend, is “the vibe coordinator”, they work well together, and, interjects Shelton, “we’re just having fun”. Next on Amstrong: Collins/Harrison v Bencic/Zverev. They look a proper partnership. Next on Ashe: Danilovic/Djokovic v Andreeva/Medvedev It’s now 5-1 on Armstrong; Townsend/Shelton are nearly there. Draper says it’s a pleasure to play with Pegula as it is to face Raducanu and Alcaraz; Pegula thanks the crowd for showing up and creating a fun atmosphere even if it took a couple of miraculous Alcaraz shots to get them going. They plan to hang out and chill during their break. Townsend/Shelton immediately secure then lose then secure a mini-break; they lead 3-1. A banger of a point to finish a really fun game, Draper taking charge to eventually punish a forehand winner down the line. …but a forehand winner from Raducanu saves it, making deuce while, on Armstrong, Rune holds for a second-set breaker. A terrific shot from Pegula, who spots Alacaraz moving inside so sticks a winner into the tramlines, raises match point… At 0-15, Alcaraz misses a chance for 0-30, then Draper intercedes at net for 30-15. On Armstrong, by the way, Rune is serving at 2-2 3-4, so to stay in the match; anyone got any spare eyes? Draper is the best player on Ashe and by far; he and Pegula make 15-30 on the Raducanu serve and he’s into net like an assassin to stick away a volley to raise two but really three match points. But the first two are quickly saved, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point, Alacaraz doing enough at net to force Pegula to serve for it at 4-2 3-2. On Armstrong, Townsend/Shelton lead 4-2 3-3. Draper is playing really well and he holds to love; at 4-2 3-1, he and Pegula are a game away. On Armstrong, Anisimova/Rune trail 2-4 2-3, meaning the former must now serve to stay in the match. Alcaraz hasn’t been at it today and is soon down 30-40 on serve, Raducanu butchering an overhead to confirm the break. It’s a long way back for them from here, Pegula/Draper up a set and a break at 4-2 2-1. . Shelton’s on one here, ridiculous net-play making 30-15; he and Townsend are having a right laugh out there, quickly securing their gold for 4-1 2-1, as Alcaraz races beyond the sideline to shove a forehand around the net-post with Raducanu having already given up the point. They still trail 40-15, though, and from there Draper sticks away a winner to give he and Pegula a 4-2 1-1 lead. Rune is forced to deuce on serve and the break-back is immediate, Townsend and Shelton celebrating in grand style. Meantime on Ashe, Raducanu is forced to deuce, Alcaraz commanding at the net to secure their hold for 2-4 1-0. Draper makes 30-15, then cunningly guides a forehand line with Alcaraz expecting him to go cross, but a netted forehand then makes things tight. And have a look! Alcaraz has been quiet so far, but fine work at the net earns deuce … then he ruins it by putting too much gas on a forehand. The first set goes to Pegula/Draper 4-2 and, while that’s going on, Anisimova/Rune break Townsend/Shelton at the first time of asking in the second to trail 2-4 1-0. And they only need two, Rune volleying long – his hands aren’t as hard as Khachanov’s but you’d never call them soft – so the Americans lead by a set to love. Alcaraz holds in short order, so Draper must indeed serve for 1-0, while Townsend/Shelton hold three break and therefore set points over Anisimova/Rune. Very quickly, it’s 2-2 on Armstrong, Rune then finishing a terrific net-exchange for 0-15, as Pegula swats a backhand wide for 30-all and pressure. But then Alcaraz nets a volley he shouldn’t and clouts a forehand wide, meaning a 1-3 first-set deficit; if he holds, Draper will have a chance to serve for it. And on Armstrong, Shelton holds for 3-2. Anisimova/Rune break back immediately to trail Townsend/Shelton 1-2, while Raducanu holds to keep her and Alcaraz in set one – but they’ll need to break Pegula next up to have a realistic chance of saving the st. Quickly, though, a double makes 0-30; Townsend retrieves for 30-all whole Draper holds to give him and Pegula a 2-0 lead over Raducanu/Alcaraz. Back on Armstrong, Shelton is dominating, rousting a forehand from the back that makes 15-40, and when Rune then goes long, the American pair lead 2-0. The set feels done and if Townsend holds next up, it will be as good as. Pegula/Draper race to 0-40, which in this format means four break points. But they only need two, Draper hooking a forehand winner to secure an advantage that, in this format, could well prove decisive in the set. Both matches are under way, Shelton holding in rapid time while Pegula/Draper make 0-30 on the Alcaraz serve. What on earth is going on with Jack Draper’s shorts? I’ll try and find a pic in the fullness of time, but he seems to be keeping spare balls in front pockets? Oh, and our teams are out on Ashe now, too. This match should be an absolute jazzer and I’m really excited to see how a rested Draper and in-form Raducanu pull up. We’re about to start knocking up on Armstrong. Townsend/Shelton have the better doubles pedigree and i’d expect them to take care of Anisimova/Rune. It’s not clear when we’ll get going again, but it should be soon, as the earliest time the second set of matches could start on Armstrong was 6.30pm BST and it’s now 7.45. Errani is delighted she has the opportunity to play more tennis; at 38, I’m not surprised. Vavassori says sticking together is their strength, and their opponents were playing really well, so it was tough. Otherwise, they’ll be focused tomorrow, and they’re doing it for the specialists. Next on Armstrong: Townsend/Shelton v Anisimova/Rune (4). It is, though, good to see Muchova, who’s had terrible trouble with a wrist injury, enjoying her tennis. She’s a fantastic player and I can’t wait to see how she does in the singles. And are head to head once again. Vavassori was sensational there, and the champs will take some stopping. Errani/Vavassori have turned the breaker around and now have match point… Next on Ashe: Pegula/Draoer (1) v Raducanu/Alcaraz. They’ve been extremely impressive and are into the last four. It might take Errani/Vavassori to beat them, if anyone can beat them. Amazing behaviour from Vavassori, who somehow leaps and contorts to deflect back a volley, then hits two more and regains the break at 3-4. That is doubles and Rublev knows it, offering a hug at the net. Muchova/Rublev rush to a 4-1 lead; looking to serve out the match, Ruud is down 15-30, but an errant return levels the game, leaving he and Swiatek two points from the semis. While all that was going on, Swiatek/Ruud raised two break points at 4-1 2-2; the first is saved … and the second, McNally with the leaping overhead. But at deuce, there’s still another go, and Ruud hooks a forehand into the corner for a winner that means his team are a hold away form the last four. On Armstrong, we’re playing a second-set breaker. …and it’s another belter, Muchova and Rublev all over the place and crossing, yet somehow find a way to stop in the point before winning it for the hold when Vaavassori nets. And what a celebration they enjoy; great stuff. They trail by a set to love but lead 4-3, Errani now serving to keep her team in the set. Now then: Errani/Vavassori win a wicked rat-a-tat-tat rally at net, make 30-all on the Muchova serve, then win another sharp exchange when Vavassori is too strong at net for deuce. Huge point coming up… Swiatek, who only arrived in New York at 12.50 this morning after winning Cincy, opens shoulders to unleash an inside-out backhand winner with both she and Ruud pinned back on the baseline. A proper dubs team don’t let them off the hook there, but at 40-30, Switek nets from close to it; that’s a missed opportunity, and McNally/Musetti trail 1-4 2-1. It’s now 2-2 in set two on Armstrong, and worth noting that we’ve not had a deciding set so far today. Rublev and Muchova, though, are doing their best to maker that happen, while Ruud holds for 4-1 1-1, he and Swiatek once again the dominant pair. I’m not sure what McNally/Musetti have for them. …and Musetti takes it. He and McNally trail by a set to love but lead 1-0 in the second. From 30-all, Muchova does superbly to hold, a forehand winner then a service winner securing a 2-1 lead in set two. Meanwhile, on Ashe, Swiatek/Ruud have 30-40 on the Musetti serve; the Norwegian nets a forehand when well in the rally, but here comes the deciding point… A hold apiece opens set two on Armstrong, where Errani/Vavassori lead 1-0 1-1. It’s hard to see how they lose from here. And now it’s Swiatek with the crucial intervention, leaning across to whack a volley at McNally with Ruud serving at 30-all; from there, they close out to take the first set. Of the new teams, so far theirs looks the best. Swiatek/Ruud earn break point at 30-40 whereupon the Norwegian then takes over, a fine return backed up with a booming forehand; he’ll now serve for the first set at 3-1. Vavassori serves out, so he and Errani lead Muchova/Rublev by a set to love. They look pretty good. Back on Ashe, at deuce, a chance for McNally/Musetti … but the former returns long and the chance is gone, Swiatek/Ruud leading 2-1. Vavassori is dynamite at the net and he stretches across it to stick away a volley for 15-30 and it’s quickly 15-40; Muchova, serving, then whips her +1 down the line and wide, meaning the champs lead 3-1. Vavassori will now serve for the first set, a pretty smart turnaround given he was broken in its first game. Swiatek/Ruud and McNally/Musetti both hold so we’re at 1-1, while Errani does likewise for 2-1, and that could be telling: she is not known for her power, so her team’s major weak point can no longer hinder them in this set. Brilliant net-coverage from Vavassori earns a chance to break back immediately at 30-4,0 and when Rublev nets, he and Errani have it. They’ve by far the most at stake here: this is their bread and butter, the money is much bigger for them, and they’re repping for dubs specialists. They’re level with Muchova/Rublev at 1-1 in the first. On Ashe, McNally/Musetti and Swiatek/Ruud are out and knocking up. We’re away again on Armstrong, Rublev raising break point with an overhead then returning hard; Errani moves out of the road but the ball is good, so he and Muchova lead the champs 1-0 with a break. On Armstrong, Errani/Vavassori and Muchova/Rublev are back with us. This should be a really fun contest. Swiatek says she’s played Ruud in the United Cup so has a good idea of where to be on the court; Ruud notes that Swiatek is on the winning train and he’s just jumping on. They’ll now share notes on McNally and Musetti, the match due on court in a matter of minutes. The winners look a good team and meet McNally/Musetti shortly. Rublev says he doesn’t know what he’s doing, he’s just trying to serve well. Muchova, though, is a good doubles player with the dexterity and power to become an even better one. They’re second-favourites for their quarter and rightly so, but they’ll give Errani/Vavssori a better game than Rybakina/Fritz did. Keys holds serve, forcing Swiatek/Ruuud to serve for the match at 4-1 3-2. That was never really in doubt. Muchova/Rublev meet Errani/Vavassori in the last eight – and in a few minutes’ time. News reaches me that, in the locker room last week, Fritz said there was no chance he’d lose to a doubles player in mixed doubles. Penny for em, Taylor old mate. Oh Maddy. Regular readers of this blog will know she’s a favourite – Muchova too – and down 15-40, she sends down a double, missing the box by a way on her second go. Swiatek/Ruud lead 4-1 10 while, on Armatrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 in their second-set breaker, so are three points from victory. As I mentioned earlier, it’s $50,000 to show, with $50,000 more on offer for the first-round winners. Mucholva holds, so we’re playing a second-set breaker on Armstrong; Williams/Opelka have to win it to stay in the competition and it’s first to seven. Coach Calv, who as a Wimbledon and Aussie Open winner, knows a thing or 90,423 about doubles, notes that Rybakina/Frtiz didn’t even manage a break point against Errani/Vavassori and, with the best will in the world, the former is not renowned for her prowess in that aspect of the game. He also adds that “Vava is a great lad” and it’s clear Errani is too. Venus finds herself serving at 15-30 and when Muchova volleys between her and Opelka, she’s down two break points. The first is saved when Rublev sends a forehand wide, the second with an ace, so here comes the deciding point at deuce … Opelka putting away and overhead with typical venom. Muchova will now serve for a breaker. A terrific forehand from Ruud, looped down the line, raises three set points at 3-1, and an ace means he and Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0; on Armstrong, Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opelka 4-2 3-3. Opelka holds so he and Venus lead Muchova/Rublev 3-2 having lost set one; Swiatek holds, so she and Ruud lead Keys/Tiafoe 3-0. I love how businesslike the Pole is – there aren’t many more focused competitors in any sport. Up 0-40, Swiatek and Ruud go for the same ball, clashing rackets, and we wind up at deuce, a Tiafoe double handing over the game after all that hard work saving it. The no 3 seeds lead 2-0; Muchova/Rublev lead Williams/Opela 4-2 1-2 on serve. A hold apiece opens set two on Armstrong, but Muchova/Rublev look the defter, more natural pair; I’d be surprised if they lost this. On Ashe. Ruud/Swiatek lead Keys/Tiafoe 1-0. Keys and Tiafoe come out linking arms – they’re great mates, which is always nice to see. I’ve not a clue what to expect from this match, but I’m fascinated to see how Swiatek pulls up having only just won Cincinnati. We’re ready to get going, the winners to meet McNally/Musetti. Two mahoosive Rublev forehands, one cross then a winner down the line, make 30-0, and terrific net-play, from him and Muchova, secure a 4-2 first set. Opelka holds in short order, meaning Rublev will now serve for the set. He’s not often broken, and it seems unlikely the pair he’s facing have what it takes to make that happen. Rublev nets a volley just as he and Muchova take over the rally and face break-back point; Venus nets a return for deuce, but with no advantage, she and Opelka have another shot at it. But they can’t take it, Venus butchering her volley, and Muchova/Rublev lead 3-1. Back on Armstrong, Venus is serving at deuce … and she’s broken for 1-2. It’s a long way back from here, Muchova and Rublev both reliable servers. McNally says she got a call from her agent telling her she had 30 seconds to decide whether to play with Musetti; “Er… yes!” was her response. Musetti explains they spoke this morning, decided which side to play, and McNally is a really good player and he enjoyed seeing her at net. He thinks they’ve good chemistry on court and is looking forward to playing again. He was really stressed serving out, but hopes he’ll be better when they come back in an hour to play their quarter. Next on Ashe: Swiatek/Ruud (3) v Keys/Tiafoe. The stadium looks pretty full, now, by the way, which is good news. As on Armstrong, they’ve seen the better doubles players win. The winning pair seemed to really enjoy that, and fully deserve their win. A fine backhand winner from Osaka, monstered inside-out, earns two break-back points … both saved, but there’ll be a third with no advantage, that’s also match point. And we’re away again on Ashe, Williams/Opelka holding for 1-0. We’re still on serve in the second, but McNally/Musetti look the likelier. With no deuces and four-game sets, though, things can turn on almost nothing. More importantly, though, what do we make of Osaka’s trainers? Sadly, I’ve no better snap for now, but back on court, a Monfils double means she and he are broken; at 5-3 3-2, McNally/Musetti will now serve for the match. McNally/Musetti seem to really be enjoying themselves and make deuce at 1-0 1-1, but Osaka/Monfils hold to keep their noses in front in set two; on Armstrong, our new teams emerge. On Ashe, we’re 1-1 on set two, McNally/Musetti by one set to love. Next on Armstrong: Williams/Opelka v Muchová/Rublev. Errani is delighted, saying she loves playing with Vavassori and thinks she did well today. Vavassori notes that though their opponents are great, he and his partner know how to play together and they’re doing it for all the doubles players who aren’t competing. Biggup. I really enjoyed Errani’s celebration there, butting heads with Vavassori; these two aren’t just dubs partners, they’re best mates, and it’s beautiful to watch. The doubles team won that easily enough, their cohesion and deftness too much for their powerful but one-dimensional opponents. On Ashe, McNally/Musetti eventually serve out and lead Osaka/Monfils by one set to love. Frankly: good Of the four out on Ashe, McNally, the least famous, is also the best doubles player. And it’s showing, Musetti pointing at her after good work allows them to make 30-15; meanwhile, Errani/Vavassori are up 30-0, two points away from victory. And this time, Musetti nails his forehand winner so, at 4-3, McNally now serve for the set while, on Ashe, Errani/Vavassori have just botched two break points at 4-2 2-2, but at deuce have a third coming up … which they take. At 4-2 3-2, they’ll now serve for the match. …then a third, so we’ll now have a deciding point, Osaka serving. …and two are saved… A Musetti forehand winner down the line catches Monfils in no-man’s land; it’s almost like he’s not a doubles specialist. So at 0-40, McNally/Musetti have three break points… …and Musetti double faults! Two set-points burned, and it’s 3-3 in the first; if we get to 4-4 we’ll have a breaker. On Armstrong, it’s 2-1 Rybakina/Fritz in set two, the first taken by Errani/Vavassori. Excellent net-play from McNally earns 30-15, but though Musetti seems to have secured set-point with a terrific backhand, Osaka/Monfils stick in the rally and eventually the Italian loses an overhead in the sun and nets. They do then make set point, but this time McNall nets a volley, so here comes the one-point settler… McNally/Musetti break Osaka/Monfils – a wild forehand from Osaka raises hands over the opportunity – so at 3-2, Musetti will now serve for the set. Vavassori serves out easily enough, so he and Errani lead Fritz/Rybakina by a set to love. On Ashe, meantime, Musetti has just put away an overhead at the net to save break point. He and McNally are level with Osaka/Monfils at 2-2 in the first. Fritz holds, forcing Vavassori to serve for the first set. Thinking more about all this, I’m also missing the prospect of an epic – in this format, they’re simply impossible. And, if you’re wondering if that’s even possible in dubs, check out – for example – the Wimbledon and Aussie Open finals won my Patten/Heliovaara. It just doesn’t get better than that. I should say, I’m not opposed to tweaking doubles to entice crowds in. I’m just opposed to lozzing doubles teams while confiscating some of their income. The crowds, by the way, are OK but nothing especially exciting. And, as I type, Fritz plays the kind of backhand down the line that might work well in singles. But Vavassori is there to cut it off with a volley, the hold follows, and the champs are a game away from set one while, on Ashe, Osaka holds to give her and Monfils a 2-1 lead over McNally/Musetti. Quicksmart, Errani/Vavassori hold for 1-1 and will now look to put pressure on Rybakina, excellence from Errani force another break point … which this time they take. They lead 2-1 in a race to four; on Ashe, it’s 1-1. First up, Fritz/Rybakina are down 30-40, the former serving. But Vavassori nets with plenty of court at which to aim, meaning a deciding point … settled by a booming Fritz forehand. I do not think this’ll be the last time I type those words or variations of them over the next fortnight. Meantime on Ashe, Monfils holds, so he and Osaka lead McNally/Musetti 1-0. Righto, I’ve found Errani/Vavassori v Rybakina/Fritz. Obviously I’m impartial, but come on the champs. Our first two pairs are out on Ashe; I’m not yet certain if we can watch Armstrong too. The last 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will be best of three sets, but first to four games not six. If a game goes to deuce, the winners of the next point take it – there’s no advantage. If a match is level at a set apiece, a 10-point match tiebreak will settle it. Breaking: Danielle Collins and Christian Harris replace Sinner/Siniakova. On which point, the reason for the TBD below is that Jannik Sinner, who retired ill when 5-0 down to Carlos Alcaraz in the Cincinnati final, has pulled out. I can’t lie, I’m buzzing that we’ve got two extra days of banging tennis. This competition should just feature the best mixed doubles pairings, not the best singles players who can be arsed. Email! “I agree, its money-fuelled tokenism and could cause the end of doubles as we know it at the major tournaments, says Andrew Benton. “Or, it might be the start of a doubles revival, from which the specialists will benefit particularly – at least people will be watching these matches as they feature the rich and famous, and who knows where that extra interest and investment could lead. Well, probably nowhere. But it’s a bit like the Hundred.” I disagree it’s like the Hundred as that isn’t taking a major tournament away from those who play the event best. I also don’t believe doubles needs gimmicks – it just needs to be marketed and respected properly. Henry Patten was really good on this when I interviewed him in May. The winners – we’ll know who they are tomorrow – will earn $1m, fives times more than went to last year’s champions. According to BBC, appearance fees are north of $50,000, or in other words, the players involved are competing to get paid and to prepare for their singles campaigns, not because they’re motivated to win a grand slam. I’ve not the slightest clue how the seeding works, but it’s worth noting that Errani/Vavassori, included as a sop to sporting merit – they’re the defending champions – have not been so honoured.

Why? Because doubles tennis is a specific skill, nurtured and developed by players relying on it – and a system that’s operated for decades – to make a living. So confiscating a huge competition from them, to hand money to suits and superstars – who do not need it and are, individually and as pairs, less good at the actual sport – doesn’t sit right with me. On the other hand and just as they want us to say, take a look at that lineup! Such is sport, such is the world, such is life; let’s make the best of it, I guess.
