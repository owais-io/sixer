  A 15-year-old boy who used a hunting knife to stab a fellow pupil at their
  school during a lunch break has been found guilty of murder. Harvey Willgoose,
  also 15, was stabbed to death in front of other children who fled “in fear and
  panic” after witnessing the attack in a courtyard at All Saints Catholic high
  school in Sheffield on 3 February. Some ran to a nearby storage cupboard,
  which they locked and barricaded. The defendant, who cannot be named because
  of his age, admitted manslaughter but denied murder, saying he had “snapped”
  after a long period of bullying and did not remember what happened. However,
  during a month-long trial at Sheffield crown court, the prosecution said the
  boy “wanted to show he was hard” and “knew exactly what he was doing”. On
  Friday a jury found him guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one after
  deliberating for more than 14 hours. The court heard the stabbing was probably
  an “act of retribution”, to “get back at Harvey for something”. Harvey’s
  mother, Caroline Willgoose, burst into tears after the verdict was delivered.
  She held her husband Mark’s hand and said “yes”, but there was no reaction
  from the defendant. In a statement read outside court Harvey’s sister, Sophie
  Willgoose, said her brother had been “full of life” and “had a unique ability
  to bring people together”. The trial heard the two boys had fallen out several
  days before Harvey’s death after taking opposite sides in a dispute between
  two other boys. Prosecutors said the defendant had an “unhealthy” interest in
  weapons and had photos on his phone of him posing with other hunting-style
  knives and a machete. Richard Thyne KC, prosecuting, told jurors the defendant
  “had a significant history of becoming angry and using violence at school”. He
  said records from a previous school “show a pattern of behaviour ranging from
  defiance, through to the use of physical violence towards other pupils and
  property”. Thyne said the defendant had researched rage rooms and, just over a
  week before the fatal stabbing, searched “waiting for someone to swing so I
  can let out my anger”. He told jurors that on the day of the stabbing, CCTV
  footage showed him trying to provoke Harvey, who remained “peaceful”. The
  court heard Harvey had told his friends that the defendant had been “acting
  like he had a knife” under his jumper in their science lesson that morning,
  but had thought he was bluffing. Jurors were told Harvey was happily talking
  to his friends as the lunch break started, when the defendant approached him.
  One teenage witness said there was an altercation and the defendant punched
  and pushed Harvey, causing him to stumble backwards, before pulling out a
  knife and stabbing him. The defendant told the trial that he was the victim of
  racist bullying and taunts about a medical condition. It meant he got angry
  quickly and “couldn’t control it”, he said. The boy told the jury his mother
  had mental health problems and his father, who hit him, was often not there.
  He told the court he took the knife to school because he thought he was going
  to get hurt that day. Gul Nawaz Hussain KC, defending, told jurors:
  “Tragically, Harvey was a combination of being the final straw that broke [the
  defendant] and the unintended face of a series of threats of violence and
  bullying he had suffered in recent months. “We say he suffered a loss of
  control which resulted in horrific and tragic consequences.” South Yorkshire’s
  metro mayor, Oliver Coppard, said the guilty verdict brought some justice for
  Harvey, “though it cannot undo the pain his family has suffered”. Coppard
  added: “He was a young boy with a bright future, and his death, especially in
  a school, has deeply affected our region. “Harvey was a young man full of
  potential, whose life has been lost to violence, while another young man now
  faces a future behind bars. It’s a stark reminder of the devastating
  consequences of knife crime and of the urgent need to invest in prevention,
  education and early support to protect young lives.” Louise Haigh, the MP for
  Sheffield Heeley, said: “All of Sheffield will be thinking of Harvey’s family
  and all those who loved him today. “An independent review will now take place
  into the circumstances that led to Harvey’s death, and it is absolutely
  essential that all questions are answered and that any and all lessons must be
  learned.” DI Joe Hackworthy, the deputy senior investigating officer for South
  Yorkshire police, said: “This trial has been a heartbreaking reminder of the
  devastation knife crime causes in our communities. “It tears lives and
  families apart, and that has never been more evident than in this tragic
  case.” After the verdict the judge, Mrs Justice Ellenbogen, told the defendant
  he would probably be sentenced in October. She will also consider an
  application to lift the defendant’s anonymity.
