  A spokesperson for JD Vance said he and his staff were unaware that the Secret
  Service decided earlier this month to ask military engineers to raise the
  water level of the Little Miami River ahead of a family boating trip, which
  took place on his birthday. “The Secret Service often employs protective
  measures without the knowledge of the vice-president or his staff, as was the
  case last weekend,” the spokesperson said. The statement followed the
  publication of a Guardian report on Wednesday that revealed the US Army Corp
  of Engineers (USACE) in Louisville, Kentucky, had been asked by the Secret
  Service to raise the outflow of a lake to accommodate Vance’s boating
  excursion. The USACE had said on Wednesday the decision was made to “support
  safe navigation” of Vance’s security detail. The Secret Service provided
  additional information on Thursday, emphasizing in a “revised” statement to
  the Guardian the vice-president’s office was “not involved in the decision”
  and that it had been “operationally necessary” to adjust the water levels to
  accommodate motorized watercraft, local law enforcement and emergency
  responders. “These decisions were made solely by agents during our standard
  advance planning process and did not involve the Office of the Vice
  President,” the Secret Service said in a statement. A public safety boat is
  also alleged to have run aground during a joint scouting mission with the
  Secret Service ahead of the trip, prompting the Secret Service’s decision to
  seek an elevation in the water level. Vance’s office had not initially
  responded to the Guardian’s request when asked about the water level change in
  connection to his boating excursion. But the publication of the Guardian’s
  story generated some controversy. Marcy Kaptur, a Democratic congresswoman
  from Ohio, posted a tweet demanding more information about the USACE move,
  saying: “Outrageous! Must be why he wasn’t available to meet about his Big
  Bonanza for Billionaires Bill which will devastate Ohio manufacturing jobs and
  our rural hospitals. The Army Corp of Engineers should share records with
  relevant committee of jurisdiction in Congress.” The news also elicited
  comparisons to an embarrassing episode for another vice-president, Al Gore,
  who faced scrutiny in 1999 after a local utility poured millions of gallons of
  water into the Connecticut River to keep him from running aground during a
  canoe trip. It is not unprecedented for the USACE to modify outflows to
  accommodate public use – for example, for use in community river events and
  training for emergency responders. USACE regulations regarding requests for
  so-called “deviations” – or any changes to normal practices – require approval
  and documentation that demonstrates why the deviation is justified. This
  process also ensures that risks associated with any deviation – including a
  flood risk or other environmental impact – is detailed. The USACE said in a
  statement on Wednesday that the Secret Service request “met the operational
  criteria outlined in the Water Control Manual for Caesar Creek Lake and did
  not require a deviation from normal procedures”. Do you have a tip related to
