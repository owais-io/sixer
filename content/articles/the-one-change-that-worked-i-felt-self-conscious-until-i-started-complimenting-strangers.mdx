  complimenting strangers

  I’m an ambivert. No, it’s not some made-up personality type. I enjoy spending
  time with others and socialising, but I need time alone to recharge. Starting
  conversations and keeping them flowing smoothly have never come naturally to
  me. I overthink everything: “Am I speaking too much? I haven’t said anything
  in the past five minutes. Quick, say something. Oh no, I’ve missed my opening.
  Wait, why did I say that? That was weird.” These are the thoughts that are
  constantly swirling in my head mid-conversation, and then I’ll go home, replay
  it all again and cringe at that one thing I said. I have always been deeply
  envious of people who can charm and easily work a room. So, in the past year,
  I’ve set myself a challenge: to compliment a stranger at least once a day –
  and it has to be genuine. If I see someone wearing something great, I’ll say
  it’s cute and ask where it’s from. If they’re sporting beautiful lipstick or
  have great hair, I’ll compliment them and ask for details. Whether it’s a
  cashier, a barista or someone walking past me, I try to say it out loud
  instead of just thinking it. The other day, in the queue at Golden Gate Bakery
  in London’s Chinatown, I told an older Asian woman her perm looked incredible.
  All bounce, no frizz. We ended up bonding over which bakeries still make
  proper old-school Chinese pineapple buns. Complimenting someone is a great
  icebreaker or conversation starter when you don’t know what else to say. And,
  if I can make someone’s day that bit brighter, that makes me happy. Seeing
  someone smile because of something I said always lifts my mood. When I started
  doing it, I was worried it might come off as a bit odd, but it’s got easier.
  It’s made me feel more confident, more present and more at ease talking to
  people. And, the truth is, I’m just nosy and curious. Some of the most
  memorable compliments I’ve ever received have come from strangers. Even three
  years after my debut book, Takeaway, came out, I still receive messages from
  people around the world who tell me my writing moved them or helped them face
  their own trauma. I’ve even made a “Good Things” folder on my laptop, filled
  with screenshots of these messages. There’s something powerful about a kind
  comment from someone who went out of their way to interact with you, even
  though they didn’t have to say anything at all. We could all use a bit more
  kindness in the world. This challenge has been as much about pushing myself
  out of my comfort zone as spreading joy. I wasn’t used to putting myself out
  there like that and letting go of my self-consciousness. But, the more I
  leaned into it, the more I realised how much I’d been holding myself back. It
  has reminded me, too, that the deepest impact can come from the smallest acts
  of care. That quiet moment of connection, no matter how brief, can be enough
  to boost your day. • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this
