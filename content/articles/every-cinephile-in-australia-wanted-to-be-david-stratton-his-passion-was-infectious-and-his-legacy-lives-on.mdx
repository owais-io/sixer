  For a long time, every cinephile in Australia – myself included – wanted to be
  David Stratton, the beloved critic who has died at age 85. And not just
  because that would involve being paid to watch and talk about movies –
  Stratton, of course, being beamed into lounge rooms across the country with
  fellow critic Margaret Pomeranz. We wanted to be him, aspired to be him,
  because of the values he represented and the manner with which he held
  himself. Stratton was deeply learned but approachable; polite but at times
  wonderfully feisty; and above all else deeply passionate about film. That
  passion was infectious, and his contributions to cinema culture in Australia
  are immeasurable. Stratton had many strings to his bow, including a
  long-running stint as director of the Sydney film festival (from 1966 to
  1983), and an even longer stint teaching a film course at the University of
  Sydney’s Centre for Continuing Education, which he ran for 35 years. But for
  me, as a teenager in the 1990s – in the earliest years of cutting my teeth as
  a critic – it was his film reviewing on TV that I found most inspiring. Like
  many others, I tuned in religiously to “David and Margaret”, as we fondly
  referred to the Movie Show and, later, At the Movies. They had excellent
  chemistry: the former a little more mannered, the latter a bit more playful,
  and the combination irresistible. I spent much of the time waiting, hoping for
  them to argue with each other (you know you did, too). All critics are
  strongly opinionated and perhaps a little sniffy-sounding from time to time;
  it’s in the job description. One of the great things about Stratton was that
  you could always feel his criticism coming from the right place – a place of
  passion and love. I met him for the first time, many years ago, at a Melbourne
  film festival opening night party at the (long gone) Greater Union cinema on
  Russell Street. I nervously introduced myself; he was affable and very easy to
  talk to. I remember asking him, perhaps a little cheekily, whether his
  well-known distaste for handheld photography might be partly a generational
  thing. I expected him to demur, but he said this may well have been the case.
  Stratton was like that: he always seemed willing to consider another person’s
  perspective, and to reassess his own. When I spoke to him for the last time in
  November last year, he reflected on changing his mind about the classic
  Australian comedy The Castle. Stratton told me he initially “thought it looked
  like a telemovie” and awarded the film one and a half stars. But after
  returning to it a couple of times, he came to the party: “I think Tiriel Mora
  is hilarious, talking about ‘the vibe’,” he said. “Things can improve when you
  look at them a second or third time.” Once, many years ago, Pomeranz invited
  me as her guest to a film critics event held at Paddington RSL in Sydney. When
  Stratton joined us for a few wines beforehand, we had a wonderful time and I
  discovered a more comedic, slightly acerbic side to him. He could be quite
  funny – sometimes in self-deprecating or unexpected ways, privately as well as
  publicly. Take, for example, Stratton’s hilarious cameo in the satirical
  comedy series Review With Myles Barlow, about a TV host who reviews absolutely
  anything. In one scene, Stratton zings “the best thing for you to do would be
  to review your own retirement,” before he and Barlow get into a (very
  realistic-looking) punch-on. There’s also the title of Stratton’s 2008 memoir,
  I Peed on Fellini. In the preface, he recounts a story about how the legendary
  Italian auteur stood next to him at a urinal at the Venice film festival in
  the 1960s. In his excitement to introduce himself, Stratton “turned towards
  the great man” and “peed all over his shoes”. But perhaps the part of the book
  that best represents Stratton’s character, and his insatiable desire to share
  his love for motion pictures, arrives at the very beginning. He dedicated the
  book to his children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews, as well as “all young
  people passionate about cinema”. He truly made so many of us passionate about
  cinema. His legacy lives on.
