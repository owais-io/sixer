  When it comes to the rise of autocracy in America, Justice Potter Stewart’s
  famous pronouncement on pornography might be particularly appropriate at the
  moment: “I know it when I see it.” The cult of personality was apparent as
  Donald Trump’s cabinet convened on Wednesday in a marathon session that could
  have embarrassed even a seasoned strongman, providing for three hours and 17
  minutes of fawning television coverage. There was Steve Witkoff, the
  president’s top envoy and negotiator, standing up in the increasingly gilded
  Cabinet Room, offering praise that could have made even Vladimir Putin blush.
  “There’s only one thing I wish for – that the Nobel committee finally gets its
  act together and realizes that you are the single finest candidate since this
  Nobel award was ever talked about,” he said to applause from secretaries of
  state, defense and other top cabinet officials. Or was it Stephen Miller on
  Fox News in effect criminalising the opposition to Trump and calling Chicago a
  “killing field” despite controverting facts. “The Democrat party is not a
  political party, it is a domestic extremist organisation,” he said in a
  strident tone, claiming that the party was devoted “exclusively to the defence
  of hardened criminals, gangbangers and illegal alien killers and terrorists”.
  Was it the president calling, on social media, for the arrest of a wealthy
  financier and his son for their support for civil society? “George Soros, and
  his wonderful Radical Left son, should be charged with RICO because of their
  support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States
  of America,” he wrote on Truth Social. Or perhaps it was the revocation of
  Secret Service protection for his electoral rival Kamala Harris, or the FBI
  raid on the home of John Bolton, his former national security adviser, who has
  become an outspoken critic of the president’s national security agenda. Or was
  it in the commonplace nature of a raid outside an elementary school in Mt
  Pleasant in Washington DC, where police staked out a school with a large
  Spanish-speaking population in what became just another immigration raid in
  America. Some activists and observers have sounded the alarm: authoritarianism
  of the kind that Americans are used to condemning abroad has become
  increasingly normal in the United States. Don Moynihan, a political scientist
  and professor at the University of Michigan, wrote this week that “today,
  America is a competitive authoritarian system, with a rapidly increasing
  emphasis on the authoritarian part.” The checklist to consolidate power, he
  wrote, includes efforts to control the government bureaucracy, the military,
  internal security, the legal system, civil society, higher education, the
  media and elections. The pursuit of those aims had been “systematic”, he
  wrote. Abdelrahman ElGendy has watched this process with a feeling of grim
  recognition. ElGendy spent six years in prison in his native Egypt on
  political charges, but fled to the US in order to work on a memoir he is set
  to release next year. In April, however, he packed his things and left the US
  following the detention of the Columbia graduate Mahmoud Khalil. ElGendy’s
  lawyers warned him that he could face a similar fate after his personal
  details were posted on a website used to target opponents of Israel’s war in
  Gaza. Since then, he has watched from abroad as the situation has worsened. “I
  haven’t second-guessed leaving the US. In fact I feel very grateful that I
  made the choice that I did before things got even worse,” he said. “I left
  Egypt to escape political persecution … The reason I left the US is because I
  started to recognize those same patterns forming around me. And since leaving
  it’s only gone downhill.” When Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) began
  carrying out large-scale raids and he was identified online as a potential
  target, he said he found himself once again waiting to be taken away at any
  moment. “I don’t think political incarceration is the most important
  characteristic of authoritarianism, it’s more the constant threat of it that
  matters most,” he said. “What really sustains authoritarianism is that quiet
  knowledge that the prison door is always within reach … that shadow is what
  shapes behavior.” From Russia to Turkey, and Hungary to El Salvador,
  activists, observers and political scientists have watched the quick
  consolidation of power by the Trump administration as it has followed a
  familiar pattern of autocratic rollout. Washington has found common cause with
  some of the world’s harshest authoritarian regimes such Russia and El
  Salvador. This week, the US deported nearly 50 Russians, according to
  activists, including some who probably requested political asylum in the
  United States. Hundreds of migrants and even citizens have been deported to
  prisons in El Salvador. “Sometimes I almost feel it’s like ‘I told you so,’”
  said Noah Bullock, the chief executive of Cristosal, a leading human rights
  group in El Salvador which was forced to leave the country last month after 25
  years of documenting abuses of power. “With the Ice crackdown and the creation
  of this massive law enforcement agency that only obeys the president – there
  are no good historical references where that works out well.” “One of the
  things that I see happening that hits me really close is when these security
  or police forces begin to look at the whole population as enemies,” he added,
  comparing it to El Salvador where they had been “trained to see the population
  as a threat”. The winner-take-all dynamics of the Trump administration, which
  has claimed a historic mandate despite winning among the thinnest majorities
  in a generation, have made this a particularly fraught moment. Along with the
  federal takeover of police forces, the other commonly cited danger is the
  Republican gerrymandering effort in Texas and resulting fightback in
  California, as well as other efforts to diminish voter turnout ahead of the
  2026 midterm and 2028 presidential elections. Some activists insist it is not
  too late to turn back. Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial
  candidate, and Kim Lane Scheppele, a professor of sociology and international
  affairs at Princeton University, wrote this week that “We Can Stop the Rise of
  American Autocracy”. Citing Hungary and Venezuela as examples, they wrote that
  “we cannot be lulled into believing that this is like anything we’ve seen
  before and can therefore be solved by simply waiting for the midterm
  elections. The antidote to Trump’s American breed of autocracy is
  understanding the severity of the threat at hand.” But others see the trend
  toward authoritarianism as merely an acceleration of the direction of US
  politics even before Trump. “That assumes that the United States was a
  functioning healthy democracy that slipped … and that’s just not the case in
  my opinion,” said ElGendy. “When a democracy is designed with this capacity
  for authoritarianism you’re never more than one election away from its
  reappearance. That’s not an accident, that’s a design flaw.”
