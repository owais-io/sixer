  The latest club to secure promotion from League One to the Premier League in
  successive seasons were ill-prepared for their sudden rise to the summit of
  English football; it was merely a happy accident of an excellent managerial
  feat. So it is no surprise that Kieran McKenna’s Ipswich are back in the
  Championship at the first opportunity. Should Birmingham emulate Friday
  night’s opponents, they have no intentions of following the same path. Every
  bold statement to emerge from the club over the summer makes it abundantly
  clear that this period in the second tier is expected to be brief. Sights have
  been set high and, on the basis of this performance against opposition that
  took points off clubs such as Chelsea, Tottenham and Aston Villa last season,
  it is easy to see why. There is, if not a swagger, then a visible belief in
  the way Birmingham’s players go about their business. That they were denied
  victory by a cruel added-time penalty decision should do little to detract
  from the dominance they showed for the majority of a fiery encounter. When Jay
  Stansfield smashed home from close range 10 minutes into the second half it
  was just rewards for the home side’s assured display, which looked set to earn
  them all three points. Alas, five minutes into the eight added on, an Ipswich
  corner was headed on to the arm of the substitute Lyndon Dykes, who knew
  nothing about it. George Hirst did not waste the opportunity to equalise from
  the penalty spot with the visitors’ only shot on target all night. “I thought
  it was really, really harsh,” said Birmingham head coach, Chris Davies, of the
  penalty decision. “He’s gone up, his arms are raised – you have to raise your
  arms to jump. It’s really harsh. That’s happened now and we have to take it.
  It had a huge impact on the game but it’s football. It can happen.”
  Nonetheless, Davies was delighted with his side’s performance: “I thought we
  were the better team, we dominated the match and deserved to win the match,
  but for the misfortune of a decision. “There was a lot to like. The players,
  it should give them confidence. We have retained the spirit, fight and
  determination we showed last season.” A fiercely contested match frequently
  boiled over into numerous melees involving multiple players from both teams.
  Footage from one of those immediately after Hirst’s converted penalty seemed
  to show a Birmingham fan attempt to strike the Ipswich midfielder Jack Taylor.
  “Jack’s alright,” said McKenna. “Somebody just showed me it. It’s obviously
  not ideal. The authorities will deal with it.” It is an intoxicating time to
  be a Birmingham supporter after watching their team set a Football League
  record for points (111) and wins (34) when romping to the League One title
  last season. There have been signings aplenty, bullish proclamations and a
  documentary that their American chair, Tom Wagner, boasted is one of “Amazon
  Prime’s top performing shows”. No surprise, then, that St Andrew’s was
  bouncing long before kick-off. If the only trade-off local fans must make for
  such delirium is the slightly odd sight of a United States flag flying above
  their home stadium then it is one they will likely stomach happily. It took 55
  minutes for the deadlock to be broken, but it seemed inevitable that it would
  be the hosts to do so, such was their casual dominance of the ball. Kyogo
  Furuhashi’s chip over the onrushing Alex Palmer rebounded off the far post and
  straight into the path of Stansfield, who had all the time in the world to
  rifle the follow-up past the defender Dara O’Shea on the line. Birmingham did
  not lose a single home league game last season and only one side who fell
  behind at St Andrew’s departed with a point. It looked for a long time as if
  Ipswich would not add to that tally, until the Dykes handball. Hirst struck
  his penalty low and firm down the middle. It was not the only decision that
  went against Birmingham. The hosts were unlucky not to take the lead after
  seven minutes, when the former Celtic forward Furuhashi – one of four summer
  signings in Birmingham’s starting XI – produced a wonderful lob over Palmer,
  only for the referee, Andrew Kitchen, to rule that he had fouled Jacob Greaves
  to win the ball. It was a soft decision, to say the least, prompting the home
  fans to voice their disdain. They would do so again when denied all three
  points at the death, but there was plenty elsewhere to hearten them.
