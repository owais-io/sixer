  Good morning. A prominent Al Jazeera journalist who had previously been
  threatened by Israel has been killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli
  airstrike. Anas al-Sharif, who was one of Al Jazeera’s most recognisable faces
  in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa
  hospital in Gaza City last night. Seven people in total were killed in the
  attack, including Al Jazeera’s correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera
  operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the
  Qatar-based broadcaster. What did Israel say about the attack? The Israel
  Defense Forces admitted the strike and claimed the reporter had “served as the
  head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organisation”. It claimed it
  had intelligence and documents found in Gaza as proof, but rights advocates
  said he had been targeted for his frontline reporting on the Gaza war and that
  Israel’s claim lacked evidence. What else is going on in the region? Benjamin
  Netanyahu has defended his plan to take control of Gaza City in the face of
  widespread international outrage. JD Vance’s attempt to link Democrats to
  Epstein revives calls to ‘release the files’ Four days after JD Vance
  reportedly asked senior Trump administration officials to come up with a new
  communications strategy for dealing with the scandal around the late convicted
  sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he appears to have put his foot in it, sparking
  a new round of online outrage even as he tried to defuse the furor. In an
  interview with Fox News broadcast yesterday, the vice-president tried to
  deflect criticism of the administration’s refusal to release the Epstein files
  by blaming Democrats. “And now President Trump has demanded full transparency
  from this. And yet somehow the Democrats are attacking him and not the Biden
  administration, which did nothing for four years,” he said. What was the
  reaction to the interview? Within minutes of the Fox News interview being
  broadcast, social media began to hum with renewed cries of “release the
  files!” Jon Favreau, Barack Obama’s former head speechwriter, said: “Release
  the names! Democrats, Republicans, billionaires, or not. What are you afraid
  of, JD Vance?” Colorado prison evacuated as wildfire becomes one of largest in
  state history A Colorado prison was evacuated as one of the largest wildfires
  in state history continued to grow, and officials advised residents of remote
  areas to be ready to leave yesterday as gusty winds and low humidity fed the
  flames. Evacuation orders were in place for mountain communities as the Lee
  fire charred more than 167 sq miles (433 sq km) across Garfield and Rio Blanco
  counties. No injuries or structural damage have been reported. The Lee fire,
  churning through trees and brush about 250 miles west of Denver, is now the
  sixth-largest single fire in the state’s history. Where were the prisoners
  evacuated to? All 179 incarcerated people were safely removed from the Rifle
  correctional center on Saturday and temporarily relocated about 150 miles away
  at the Buena Vista correctional complex. In other news … In a social media
  post yesterday, Donald Trump demanded homeless people in Washington DC leave
  the capital or face eviction, promising to use federal officers to jail
  criminals. Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the US government 15% of their
  revenues from chip sales in China, under an unprecedented arrangement to
  obtain export licenses for the semiconductors, the Financial Times reported.
  Europe’s leaders have raised the pressure on Donald Trump to involve Ukraine
  in a planned summit with Vladimir Putin, as Germany warned the White House
  against any deal hatched “over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians”. Stat of

  meteorite, say experts A cherry tomato-sized fireball that crashed through the
  roof of a metro Atlanta house in June was a meteorite 20m years older than
