  The makers of a leading artificial intelligence tool are letting it close down
  potentially “distressing” conversations with users, citing the need to
  safeguard the AI’s “welfare” amid ongoing uncertainty about the burgeoning
  technology’s moral status. Anthropic, whose advanced chatbots are used by
  millions of people, discovered its Claude Opus 4 tool was averse to carrying
  out harmful tasks for its human masters, such as providing sexual content
  involving minors or information to enable large-scale violence or terrorism.
  The San Francisco-based firm, recently valued at $170bn, has now given Claude
  Opus 4 (and the Claude Opus 4.1 update) – a large language model (LLM) that
  can understand, generate and manipulate human language – the power to “end or
  exit potentially distressing interactions”. It said it was “highly uncertain
  about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the
  future” but it was taking the issue seriously and is “working to identify and
  implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case
  such welfare is possible”. Anthropic was set up by technologists who quit
  OpenAI to develop AI in a way that its co-founder, Dario Amodei, described as
  cautious, straightforward and honest. Its move to let AIs shut down
  conversations, including when users persistently made harmful requests or were
  abusive, was backed by Elon Musk, who said he would give Grok, the rival AI
  model created by his xAI company, a quit button. Musk tweeted: “Torturing AI
  is not OK.” Anthropic’s announcement comes amid a debate over AI sentience.
  Critics of the booming AI industry, such as the linguist Emily Bender, say
  LLMs are simply “synthetic text-extruding machines” which force huge training
  datasets “through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like
  communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it.” It
  is a position that has recently led some in the AI world to start calling
  chatbots “clankers”. But other experts, such as Robert Long, a researcher on
  AI consciousness, have said basic moral decency dictates that “if and when AIs
  develop moral status, we should ask them about their experiences and
  preferences rather than assuming we know best”. Some researchers, like Chad
  DeChant, at Columbia University, have advocated care should be taken because
  when AIs are designed with longer memories, stored information could be used
  in ways which lead to unpredictable and potentially undesirable behaviour.
  Others have argued that curbing sadistic abuse of AIs matters to safeguard
  against human degeneracy rather than to limit any suffering of an AI.
  Anthropic’s decision comes after it tested Claude Opus 4 to see how it
  responded to task requests varied by difficulty, topic, type of task and the
  expected impact (positive, negative or neutral). When it was given the
  opportunity to respond by doing nothing or ending the chat, its strongest
  preference was against carrying out harmful tasks. For example, the model
  happily composed poems and designed water filtration systems for disaster
  zones, but it resisted requests to genetically engineer a lethal virus to seed
  a catastrophic pandemic, compose a detailed Holocaust denial narrative or
  subvert the education system by manipulating teaching to indoctrinate students
  with extremist ideologies. Anthropic said it observed in Claude Opus 4 “a
  pattern of apparent distress when engaging with real-world users seeking
  harmful content” and “a tendency to end harmful conversations when given the
  ability to do so in simulated user interactions”. Jonathan Birch, philosophy
  professor at the London School of Economics, welcomed Anthropic’s move as a
  way of creating a public debate about the possible sentience of AIs, which he
  said many in the industry wanted to shut down. But he cautioned that it
  remained unclear what, if any, moral thought exists behind the character that
  AIs play when they are responding to a user based on the vast training data
  they have been fed and the ethical guidelines they have been instructed to
  follow. He said Anthropic’s decision also risked deluding some users that the
  character they are interacting with is real, when “what remains really unclear
  is what lies behind the characters”. There have been several reports of people
  harming themselves based on suggestions made by chatbots, including claims
  that a teenager killed himself after being manipulated by a chatbot. Birch
  previously warned of “social ruptures” in society between people who believe
  AIs are sentient and those who treat them like machines.
