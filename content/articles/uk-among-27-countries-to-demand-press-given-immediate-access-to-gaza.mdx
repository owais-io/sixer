  The UK is among more than 20 countries demanding that Israel immediately give
  international journalists access to Gaza to allow them to cover the “unfolding
  humanitarian catastrophe” in the war zone. In a major escalation of pressure
  on Israel, 27 countries have signed a joint statement calling for it to end
  its block on press access and for protection for journalists operating in
  Gaza. The UK, Germany, Australia and Ukraine are among those to have signed
  the statement from the Media Freedom Coalition (MFC), an international
  advocacy group that the UK helped to create. “In light of the unfolding
  humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, we, the undersigned members of the Media
  Freedom Coalition, urge Israel to allow immediate independent foreign media
  access and afford protection for journalists operating in Gaza,” they say.
  “Journalists and media workers play an essential role in putting the spotlight
  on the devastating reality of war. Access to conflict zones is vital to
  carrying out this role effectively. We oppose all attempts to restrict press
  freedom and block entry to journalists during conflicts.” The governments
  condemned the alleged targeting of journalists in Gaza, after analysis
  indicating at least 192 journalists and media workers have been killed in
  Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon since the war began. The Committee to
  Protect Journalists (CPJ), which compiled the data, said it was the deadliest
  period for journalists since it had begun gathering data in 1992. It is
  investigating 130 additional cases of alleged killings, arrests and injuries
  of journalists. The statement follows an outcry earlier this month when a
  targeted Israeli attack killed four Al Jazeera journalists, two freelancers
  and a seventh person, leading to UN condemnation. The MFC statement said: “We
  also strongly condemn all violence directed against journalists and media
  workers, especially the extremely high number of fatalities, arrests and
  detentions. We call on the Israeli authorities and all other parties to make
  every effort to ensure that media workers in Gaza, Israel, the West Bank and
  East Jerusalem – local and foreign alike – can conduct their work freely and
  safely. “Deliberate targeting of journalists is unacceptable. International
  humanitarian law offers protection to civilian journalists during armed
  conflict. We call for all attacks against media workers to be investigated and
  for those responsible to be prosecuted in compliance with national and
  international law.” It reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire, the
  unconditional release of the remaining Israeli hostages and the free flow of
  humanitarian aid. The statement follows pleas from news organisations and
  senior journalists, with recent claims that freelance reporters working in
  Gaza were at risk of starvation as a result of the conditions in the strip.
  Last month, some of the world’s biggest news outlets, including BBC News,
  Agence France-Presse, Associated Press and Reuters, said they were
  “desperately concerned” about journalists in Gaza, saying staff were
  “increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families” amid widespread
  reports of mass starvation.
