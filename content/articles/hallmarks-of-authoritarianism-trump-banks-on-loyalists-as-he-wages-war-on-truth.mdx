  Donald Trump is waging a war on truth by firing top officials who present
  facts he finds unpalatable, while he banks on key loyalists at executive
  agencies to bolster his policies and powers by “rewriting history’s narrative”
  and squelching dissent, say scholars and former officials. Trump’s penchant
  for rejecting facts in an authoritarian style was especially revealed in
  August by his sudden firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner,
  charging without evidence that her latest report was “totally rigged”, just
  hours after she released data undercutting his rosy economic boasts, say
  critics. The firing was emblematic of Trump’s expanding battle against people
  and policies that challenge the US president’s often conspiratorial views
  about truth such as his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden, which Trump last fall
  falsely blamed again on “fraud”. From the justice department to the
  Environmental Protection Agency to other key agencies, Trump loyalists have
  pushed falsehoods and taken radical steps to promote Trump’s policies and what
  a Trump adviser in 2017 dubbed “alternative facts”. In doing so, Trump and his
  top allies are acting in an authoritarian style by revising history, rejecting
  facts and widely accepted science, critics add. “The irony in firing the
  widely respected economist and BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer is that the
  commissioner has very little to do with the actual production of the figures
  Trump says were ‘rigged’,” said Peter Shane, who teaches constitutional law at
  New York University. “‘Rigged’, in Trump-speak, just means ‘unfavorable to
  Trump’. To the extent the firing had an actual purpose, it was not to reform
  [the] BLS, but to send a message to all agency heads that the release of
  unflattering information, no matter how routine or how objective, would put
  their jobs in jeopardy,” Shane added. Little wonder that Trump on 11 August
  announced he was nominating EJ Antoni, an economist at the rightwing Heritage
  Foundation who has been a vocal critic of the BLS, to replace her, and boasted
  that he “will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST AND ACCURATE”.
  Scholars, ex-justice department officials and even some conservatives say
  Trump’s and his loyalists attacks on truth have increased in his second term
  in dangerous ways, since he has avoided choosing the kinds of aides who before
  served as guardrails against some of his instincts to revise history and
  promote radical policies. “The difference between Trump 1 and Trump 2 is that
  he now has no guardrails … Now Trump is surrounded by people who want to be
  like him. He learned his lesson of not having people around him who would say
  no to him,” said George Conway, a lawyer and board president of the Society
  for the Rule of Law, a group that includes several ex-justice department
  officials with Republican pedigrees who have been critical of Trump’s
  authoritarian-style moves. Conway added: “He’s always tried to create his own
  set of facts. None of this is new. It’s part of Trump’s conspiratorial
  mindset.” Shane stressed: “Sabotaging independent sources of knowledge,
  flooding communications media with disinformation, and rewriting history’s
  narrative to conform to ideology rather than fact are hallmarks of
  authoritarianism.” Shane’s points are underscored by multiple Trump and
  administration actions, including Trump’s counter-factual charges that crime
  in Washington was “out of control” despite data released early this year that
  showed violent crime in DC was at a 30-year low. Still, flanked by several
  cabinet members, Trump held a press conference to declare a “public safety
  emergency” and put DC police under temporary federal control, while deploying
  800 national guard troops to America’s capital. Elsewhere, Trump loyalists at
  the EPA moved this month to rescind its key 2009 endangerment finding, which
  has underpinned regulatory efforts to fight climate change since the Barack
  Obama administration as the agency increasingly rejects widely accepted
  scientific facts. Likewise, the justice department impaneled a grand jury in
  August to investigate a conspiratorial charge by Trump’s director of national
  intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, that Obama and some of his aides engaged in a
  “treasonous conspiracy” by launching inquiries in 2016 into Russian efforts to
  influence that election to help Trump win. In another battle royale against
  facts, the health secretary and vaccine sceptic, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has
  stepped up efforts to block some vaccines that scientists regard as crucial
  weapons in fighting Covid and other diseases. Critics say Trump’s moves to
  undermine facts have been escalating in dangerous ways. “From government
  agencies to universities, the president is wielding the cudgel of federal
  money and the threat of presidential power to intimidate people whose data and
  ideas don’t support him,” said the Princeton political historian Julian
  Zelizer. Zelizer said: “While many presidents have been critical of economic
  data [such as Herbert Hoover], this is a new level of hostility. Someone says
  something he does not like, that person is removed. The point is to create
  fear so that others think twice before saying something that is harmful to the
  administration.” Shane of NYU warned that Trump’s administration allies have
  mimicked his actions. “Trump’s top officials, many of whom lack the
  experience, judgment, intellect and temperament to do their jobs properly,
  know Trump’s playbook and are determined to remain where they are … Everyone
  around Trump sees he has paid very little cost for his perfidy. They’re
  following the boss.” Leaders at key agencies have followed Trump’s playbook of
  attacking facts and widely accepted science with regulatory moves to undermine
  climate change science and alternative fuels. The EPA, as well as the interior
  and energy departments, has stepped up efforts to throttle spending and
  regulations to expand wind and solar energy; Trump has attacked green energy
  as part of his conspiratorial view that climate change is a “hoax”, while
  aggressively promoting his fossil fuel agenda of “drill, baby, drill”. “The
  Trump team has launched an all-of-government assault on wind and solar,” said
  Michael Gerrard, who runs the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia
  University. Gerrard said: “When Obama’s EPA issued the endangerment finding in
  2009 there was a ton of scientific evidence supporting it. There are now 10
  tons. There are a few ounces on the other side, but Trump’s EPA is seizing on
  the ounces as an excuse to wipe out our strongest legal tool to fight climate
  change. “The EPA, the energy and interior departments, and even the Federal
  Aviation Administration, are using all available tools, and making up some new
  ones, to suppress these sources of clean power.” Other experts and scientists
  are alarmed too that Kennedy has stepped up efforts to block vaccines he has
  long castigated without real evidence as dangerous. Earlier this month,
  Kennedy announced in a statement the ending of 22 projects worth $500m to
  develop mRNA technologies that have been used in vaccines to combat
  respiratory viruses such as Covid and the flu. In response to Kennedy’s move,
  Trump told reporters that “we’re on to other things” and said the
  administration was focused now on “looking for other answers to other
  problems, to other sicknesses and diseases”. Trump, a former champion of the
  Covid vaccines, seems to have ignored several recent moves by Kennedy which
  health experts have sharply criticized. In July, Kennedy abruptly fired a
  17-member CDC panel that recommends vaccines, and replaced it with a smaller
  committee that boasts some known vaccine sceptics. Further, Kennedy has balked
  at offering strong support for vaccinations even as the CDC reported 1,356
  measles cases as of this month, the highest total of annual cases since 2000,
  when the United States declared measles eliminated. On a legal battlefront,
  former prosecutors say truth and facts are under assault at the justice
  department, which increasingly has acted without solid evidence of misconduct
  to investigate Trump’s declared foes, such as the former FBI director James
  Comey and ex-CIA director John Brennan. Trump in July baselessly accused Obama
  of “treason” for his administration’s inquiry into Russian influence efforts
  to help Trump win in 2016. The move came despite multiple reports, including
  one from the bipartisan Senate intelligence panel, concluding that Moscow
  mounted a drive to boost Trump. Trump’s comments followed Gabbard’s release of
  classified materials that did not support his allegations, say critics. Yet
  the attorney general, Pam Bondi, then impaneled a grand jury to investigate
  the charges as Gabbard requested. Some legal scholars see a pattern with
  earlier Trump tactics to fudge facts and revise history and warn of the
  justice department’s marked politicization under Trump and Bondi. The Columbia
  law professor and ex-federal prosecutor Daniel Richman said: “The announcement
  of a grand jury investigation into Obama and Biden officials [is] just the
  latest effort to support a false narrative with the presence of official
  action.” From a historical perspective, critics say the Trump administration’s
  assaults on truth and facts will do long-term damage. “The United States did
  not put a man on the moon or invent the transistor, the internet, the polio
  vaccine, or [on the negative side] the atomic bomb by ignoring or making up
  facts,” said Gerrard. “All these achievements resulted from scientists doing
  the very hard work of discovering truths about the physical world and using
  them in brilliant ways. “A country that instead ignores facts it doesn’t like
  and invents falsities can achieve very little beyond satisfying those who
  share the leaders’ ideology. We are on a dangerous path to mediocrity, or
  worse.”
