  “There’s something I need to tell you,” said my new boyfriend, Brent. We were
  sitting on his leafy balcony in Sydney. His expression was grave, his skin
  pale – nothing like his usual relaxed, smiley self. He’d been hiding something
  from me and he’d finally decided to confess. My thoughts raced. He’s married.
  He has a kid. He’s moving to a small island in the South Pacific. “I have a
  pet,” he blurted out. I blinked. He rubbed his palms together nervously, then
  disappeared into his bedroom. I waited, beginning to guess where this was
  going. He reemerged clutching a writhing snake. Brent had been hiding his pet
  python from me because he was terrified it would be a dealbreaker. It wasn’t,
  I actually love snakes – although if it had been a tarantula, this story might
  have had a different ending. We had met at my work Christmas party only a few
  weeks earlier. He was invited as a guest from another company and was busily
  chatting with a friend of mine whom he already knew. I stood on the sidelines
  and stared at his face. So handsome. Then, his eyes flickered to mine and held
  my gaze, and something quietly stirred within me. The shift was subtle, but it
  was unmistakably there. After my colleague drifted away, Brent and I started
  talking. We couldn’t stop. Noticing his accent, I made the rookie mistake of
  asking him (a Canadian) where he was from in the US. He didn’t mind at all.
  There wasn’t much that bothered him. He was gentle, patient, kind – and
  irresistibly intelligent. We swapped numbers and for our first date, he took
  me to a buzzy Thai restaurant beside the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We talked so
  much our jaws ached. I still couldn’t quite tear my eyes off him. Things moved
  fast. There were weekend drives in his cool vintage car, staying up all night
  babysitting wide-eyed puppies, countless red carpet events I dragged him to
  because I was working as an entertainment reporter, and more of that endless,
  joyful talking. He told me he believed that if we’d met when we were little
  kids, he would have wanted to be my best friend. I told him I could be locked
  in a jail cell with him for the rest of my life and never get bored. He was
  utterly fascinating to me. Still is. Not long after the snake reveal, my
  ex-boyfriend contacted me out of the blue asking if we could do a video call.
  When he and I broke up, it hit me pretty hard. Even though I was just about to
  leave to go to Brent’s place, my ex said he had something to tell me.
  Apparently, those words are my relationship anthem. Somehow, though, I knew
  this wasn’t going to be about a pet. Through the screen, my ex revealed he’d
  cheated on me while we were together. Not once, not twice – but about 20
  times. He’d come to realise he had some problems he needed to work out and
  part of that involved telling me the truth. And I do commend him for that. It
  can’t have been easy. But at that moment, I felt as though I’d been punched in
  the chest. I was sick with hurt and humiliation. All the signs I had missed
  began flashing up in vivid detail. I thought I’d be fine by the time I got to
  Brent’s; after all, my ex and I had been over for a while. But the grief and
  sense of betrayal wouldn’t let me go. I walked into the apartment, sat down on
  the couch, and broke down in tears. I couldn’t stop. I was so embarrassed –
  and horrified for Brent. This was supposed to be our honeymoon phase. Why was
  I crying over someone else? I tried to hide my face. He asked me what was
  wrong and I told him everything. I braced for confusion, jealousy, maybe even
  a fight. Brent had every right to question why I was so upset about another
  guy. Instead, he reached for my hands and looked straight into my eyes, his
  brow furrowed. He looked heartbroken – but not for himself. “I am so sorry,”
  he said. “That must have been really awful to hear.” Then, he pulled me into a
  tight hug, his palm stroking my back. He never once made it about him. His
  concern was all for me. That was when I knew what a good man looked like, and
  that I had fallen in love. Seventeen years later, we’re still together. We’ve
  lived overseas for 10 of those years, been married for 12, and have two
  amazing children – plus the slightly alarming reptile who has been with us all
  along. Brent is still my favourite person to talk to. With him, I’ve found a
  kind of safety and comfort that I hope lasts a lifetime. Natalie Murray is the
