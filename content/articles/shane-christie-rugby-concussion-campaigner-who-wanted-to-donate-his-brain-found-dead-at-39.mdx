  Shane Christie, the former Māori All Blacks player who had wanted his brain to
  be studied after suffering from the effects of multiple concussions, has died
  aged 39. The New Zealand rugby player had campaigned for greater awareness in
  rugby of the impact of repeated blows to the head. After retiring from the
  game in 2017, Christie reportedly suffered from headaches, memory lapses,
  speech problems, depression and mood swings consistent with chronic traumatic
  encephalopathy (CTE). Christie, who also played for Otago Highlanders,
  Canterbury Crusaders and the All Blacks sevens team, was found dead at his
  home in Nelson on Wednesday morning after police were called to the address.
  “The death will be referred to the coroner and we have no further information
  or comment we can provide,” said police. New Zealand Rugby said Christie was
  deeply passionate about the sport and would be “remembered always”. “Any time
  the rugby community loses a member it is felt deeply,” New Zealand Rugby said.
  “Shane’s passion for the game will be remembered always. Our thoughts are with
  Shane’s whānau [family], friends, former teammates, and community at this
  incredibly difficult time.” Christie reportedly wanted to donate his brain to
  the New Zealand sports human brain bank for its studies into CTE, a
  degenerative disease caused by repetitive head trauma that cannot be detected
  in living people. “Without brain donations we’re not going to be able to
  identify how long it takes to get this disease. It’s important to help the
  research in New Zealand,” Christie had said. Christie helped set up the Billy
  Guyton Foundation with the aim of further understanding the effects of
  concussion on players after the death of his teammate in 2023. Guyton was the
  first New Zealand rugby player to be diagnosed with CTE.
