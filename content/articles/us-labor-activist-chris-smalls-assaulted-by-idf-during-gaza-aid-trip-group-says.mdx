  On Saturday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intercepted and boarded the
  Handala, an aid ship that attempted to reach Gaza as part of the Freedom
  Flotilla Coalition, a grassroots international collective that has worked to
  end Israel’s blockade of Gaza since 2010. According to the coalition, IDF
  soldiers beat and choked the American labor activist Chris Smalls, who was
  onboard the ship. Smalls is most well-known for co-founding the Amazon Labor
  Union. The Handala, which carried food, baby formula, diapers and medicine,
  was attempting to breach Israel’s blockade of Gaza, as Palestinians there
  continue to starve in what UN-backed hunger experts have called a “worst-case
  scenario of famine” that is unfolding. “The Freedom Flotilla Coalition
  confirms that upon arrival in Israeli custody, US human rights defender Chris
  Smalls was physically assaulted by seven uniformed individuals. They choked
  him and kicked him in the legs, leaving visible signs of violence on his neck
  and back,” the Freedom Flotilla Coalition wrote in a statement posted on
  Instagram on Tuesday morning. “When his lawyer met with him, Chris was
  surrounded by six members of Israel’s special police unit. This level of force
  was not used against other abducted activists. We condemn this violence
  against Chris and demand accountability for the assault and discriminatory
  treatment he faced.” In a statement to the Guardian, the Israeli foreign
  ministry wrote: “Contrary to the claims made, the passenger violently
  resisted. This was a planned provocation intended to create media attention.
  We emphasize that no other passenger made a similar claim.” The Guardian has
  contacted Smalls for his response to the foreign ministry’s allegations.
  Smalls, the only Black person onboard the boat, was one of 21 members of the
  group who were detained. Others included 19 civilians, including
  parliamentarians, medics and engineers, and two journalists. Jacob Berger, a
  Jewish American actor who shared on Instagram that Smalls was in “great
  spirits” after his detention – everyone else who was detained, he said, should
  be released on Tuesday or Wednesday. The interception of the Handala came as
  more than 30 Israeli public figures called for “crippling sanctions” over
  Israel’s starvation of Gaza. Donald Trump said he wanted “to make sure
  [Gazans] get the food, every ounce of food” during a recent meeting with the
  UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. The Handala was not the first effort by the
  Freedom Flotilla Coalition to deliver aid to Gaza. Previous attempts,
  including one in June in which Greta Thunberg was arrested, were also
  intercepted by Israel. In 2010, Israeli commandos killed 10 activists setting
  sail for Gaza on the Mavi Marmara. “We are calling on others around the world,
  definitely our countries, to live up to their obligation of enforcing
  international law, of protecting human rights, but also other institutions
  that are founded to do the same,” said Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian American
  attorney and Handala member, in an appearance on Monday on Democracy Now. “We
  should not be waiting for Israel to give permission for food or other
  humanitarian aid to enter … we need to be breaking, challenging and breaking
  the blockade.” While they were onboard the flotilla, Araf said that the US
  government did not make contact with the seven American members of the crew,
  though France, Spain and Italy contacted their citizens to offer consular
  services after their detention. It is not yet clear if Smalls or any other
  American citizens have been contacted since their detention. They were
  “legitimizing Israeli piracy on the high seas. And that is unacceptable to
  us,” she said, referring to countries that offered services following the
  illegal boarding in international waters. “And that is the kind of impunity
  that our governments, all governments, really, have been allowing Israel to
  just violate international law.”
