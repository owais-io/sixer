  People lose more weight if they cook minimally processed food from scratch
  than if they eat ultra-processed and ready-made foods, according to the first
  study to establish a clear link between ultra-processed foods (UPFs) and
  weight. Trial participants were given one of two diets with the same
  nutritional profile for eight weeks. One diet was made up of UPFs while the
  other comprised minimally processed foods. When the first group ate breakfast
  bars and ready-made lasagne, for example, the second ate oats soaked in milk
  and natural yoghurt and homemade spaghetti bolognese. At the end of the trial,
  participants on the second diet had lost twice as much weight as those on the
  first. Prof Chris van Tulleken, an author of the study and of the book
  Ultra-Processed People, said: “The global food system at the moment drives
  diet-related poor health and obesity, particularly because of the wide
  availability of cheap, unhealthy food. “This study highlights the importance
  of ultra-processing in driving health outcomes in addition to the role of
  nutrients like fat, salt and sugar. It underlines the need to shift the policy
  focus away from individual responsibility and on to the environmental drivers
  of obesity, such as the influence of multinational food companies in shaping
  unhealthy food environments.” The study by University College London and UCL
  hospitals NHS trust was designed to address the lack of good-quality evidence
  on the health outcomes of UPFs. The findings suggest that choosing minimally
  processed foods and cooking from scratch as much as possible rather than
  buying ultra-processed packaged foods or ready meals may be more effective for
  losing weight. Minimally processed means that a food has undergone limited
  alteration from its natural state, for example fruits, vegetables, whole
  grains, meat, fish and dairy products such as natural yoghurt. UPFs have been
  significantly altered and typically contain ingredients not commonly used in
  home cooking, such as artificial flavours, preservatives and emulsifiers.
  People who followed the UPF diet consumed 120 calories fewer than usual and
  lost 1% of their weight on average during the study. Those who followed the
  minimally processed diet consumed 290 calories fewer and lost 2% of their
  weight on average, including much more fat mass. Over a year, this could scale
  up to a 13% weight reduction for men and 9% for women, the researchers said.
  Dr Samuel Dicken, the first author of the study, said that while previous
  research has linked UPFs with poor health outcomes, not all are “inherently
  unhealthy”. But, he explained, because UPFs have a softer texture and are more
  calorie-dense, they do make it easier to overeat. The study, published in
  Nature Medicine, split 55 adults with an average BMI of 32, indicating
  obesity, into two groups, who followed one diet for eight weeks, returned to
  their normal diet for four weeks, and then swapped to the other diet for
  another eight weeks. The diets were nutritionally matched in accordance with
  government advice on healthy eating from the Eatwell Guide. Participants had
  food containing more calories than they needed delivered to their homes and
  were told to eat as much or as little as they wanted, as they would normally.
  Participants also completed questionnaires to assess food cravings, which
  found significant improvements in the number of cravings and ability to resist
  them on the minimally processed diet compared with the UPF one – despite the
  fact that weight loss is often associated with stronger cravings. The team
  recommended that policymakers use warning labels, marketing restrictions,
  progressive taxation and subsidies to increase awareness and make healthy
  diets affordable for all. Dr Adrian Brown, another author of the study, said:
  “The cost-of-living crisis has impacted people’s choices on food. Healthy food
  is up to two times more expensive than unhealthy food.” Rob Percival, the Soil
  Association’s head of food policy, said: “For decades, the UK government’s
  ‘healthy eating’ guidelines have neglected processing, assuming that whole
  foods and ultra-processed products might deliver the same health outcomes. We
  now know that to be false.” A Department of Health and Social Care
  spokesperson said the government had commissioned research to understand more
  about the health impacts of UPFs and was “committed to tackling obesity and
  building a healthier Britain”. Meanwhile, the NHS should do more to help those
  who have come off a course of obesity drugs or just finished a weight loss
  programme, to ensure they do not regain the pounds they have lost. Such people
  should receive regular check-ups, advice and tailored action plans to help
  ensure they stay healthy, according to the National Institute for health and
  Clinical Excellence. How do the diets compare? Minimally processed Breakfast:
  Cinnamon and apple overnight oats Lunch: Mexican chicken with salad and
  flatbread Dinner: Home-cooked cottage pie with green beans and corn Ultra
  processed Breakfast: Oat and fruit breakfast bar Lunch: Meal deal-style
  packaged chicken tikka wrap Dinner: Ready-made cottage pie with greens and
  corn
