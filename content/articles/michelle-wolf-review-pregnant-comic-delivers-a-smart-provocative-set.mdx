  It’s seven years since Michelle Wolf addressed the White House correspondents’
  dinner, but she still gets a round of applause for merely mentioning it here.
  Few other comics are so associated with a single, one-off performance. That
  gig pitched the Pennsylvania native into a political firestorm – but in her
  recent live work, the comic (now based between London and Barcelona) is as apt
  to joke about her own life, and gender politics, as current affairs. And
  tonight, there are pressing personal, and very gender-related, concerns to
  address: Wolf appears onstage eight months’ pregnant. As you’d imagine,
  there’s plenty of material about that experience, including a riff on the
  cholestasis she developed in her first pregnancy, and another straining to
  justify (by characteristically blunt comparison) the “placenta smoothie” she
  consumed at the birth of her first child. But, understandably for an act who
  generates half an hour’s new standup every week for her podcast Thought Box,
  Wolf’s show doesn’t linger on any topic for too long, ranging across her life
  in a multiracial family, pigeon spies in the second world war, and the
  experience of being a conjoined twin. It teeters on the edge of tastelessness,
  that last one, but a feature of Wolf’s comedy is an aversion to
  right-thinking, a preparedness to alienate in pursuit of the joke. See a gag
  comparing drag queens to Belgian colonists in the Congo, or another refusing
  to engage in baby talk for fear of what her burbling tot might actually be
  saying. That’s what gives the 40-year-old her edge: even generic routines (the
  one about women needing pockets, say) can swerve on to sensitive territory.
  It’s not always a show where the thinking develops: Wolf’s routines, delivered
  with a mischievous perma-smile, can feel like gambits or provocations, thrown
  out to trigger a reaction or start a conversation – about how the village it
  takes to raise a child has been atomised, say, or about the limits of her, and
  her audience’s, liberalism. Together, they make for a smart and sly set in
  which the tongue that lashed Donald Trump is turned instead on gender
  politics, Wolf’s foibles, and our own. At Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh,
