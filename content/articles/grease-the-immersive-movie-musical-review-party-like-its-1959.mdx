  There’s no secret about what’s happening in Battersea Park: the signs are
  quite literally there at the entrance, welcoming you to Rydell High School.
  You can even spot the real-life ferris wheel that hints at the fairground
  finale to come. Grease isn’t the first musical to be given Secret Cinema’s
  signature immersive treatment – there was a Moulin Rouge in 2017 – but it is
  the most ambitious, with a live cast performing all of its memorable numbers
  in what is essentially a hybrid show. The original movie plays on overhead
  screens, with occasional footage intercut from a black-and-white stage feed,
  and a (fabulous) band provides the live soundtrack. It takes a chaotic
  quarter-hour to get your head around what you’re watching. The actors aren’t
  lip-syncing their lines, so if you’re following the screen it looks like
  clunky dubbing. The dialogue regularly gets lost behind the music: perhaps the
  sound mix will get better over the course of the run. Perhaps it’s not
  important – this is, ultimately, a full-costume karaoke night, the chance for
  folk to belt out Hopelessly Devoted to You and Greased Lightnin’ without any
  fear of being removed by an usher. As for the 30-strong cast, none of them
  would shame the West End. Stephanie Costi is a sweetly voiced Sandy, while
  Lucy Penrose reconfirms that Rizzo is easily the show’s most compelling
  character. Some of the performances feel impressionistic, and Jennifer Weber’s
  choreography riffs only gently on the original, but you wouldn’t expect
  anything else of a production dedicated to the faithful rendering of the
  movie’s world. Matt Costain’s direction does spring a couple of genuine
  surprises; it also co-opts those who have paid for VIP tickets as willing
  extras. The charismatic Waylon Jacobs provides a linchpin role, transforming
  the film version’s narcissistic TV presenter Vince Fontaine into an
  all-purpose MC and entertainment director. He leads the crowd in conga lines
  around Tom Rogers’ meticulous sets, from the Frosty Palace that serves up real
  ice cream sundaes to the gym floor where the audience can join in the iconic
  dance contest. And that, after all, is what people have come for: to party
  like it’s 1959. So what if the movie’s climax is better on screen than it is
  in the room? At Evolution London, Battersea Park, until 7 September
