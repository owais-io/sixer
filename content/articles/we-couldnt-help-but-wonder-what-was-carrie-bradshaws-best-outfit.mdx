  After 27 years, 94 episodes, a questionable three-series reboot and a pair of
  films we’d rather not talk about, last week’s “heavy-handed” finale of And
  Just Like That marked the last appearance of TV’s best-dressed character:
  Carrie Bradshaw. As we say a final farewell, for this week’s newsletter we
  asked Guardian writers for their most memorable Carrie outfits. I’ll start
  with … The LGD | season two, episode 15 Despite the OTT tulle dresses, tie-dye
  capris and ridiculous accessories, (kneepad tights anyone?) it’s the little
  black grey dress that she wears to brunch that is most memorable to me. After
  a disappointing night with Vaughn Wysel (Justin Theroux), Carrie emerges from
  her apartment not downbeat but giddy, knowing she has a story that is going to
  make her gang shriek with laughter over eggs and cosmos. I love how she wears
  what could be considered a classic date-night dress to see her girlfriends.
  The gold strappy sandals, big Gucci embossed shoulder bag, signature nameplate
  necklace and classic aviators all add to the confident mood. In today’s world
  of conservative tradwife dressing, it’s refreshing to see a single,
  thirtysomething woman dressing for herself. It’s also a nice flipped bird to
  those who think age should determine what one can and can’t wear. The Stella
  McCartney horse print trousers | season four, episode 11 The early 2000s was a
  weird time when it came to what people wore. You had hipster jeans designed to
  reveal hip bones, the pob (Victoria Beckham’s bob) and those capri pants that
  are threatening to come back. By contrast, Sex and the City, and Carrie in
  particular, seemed like a grown-up world of aspiration, where people didn’t
  just look at clothes worn on the catwalk, they actually wore them. For me,
  nothing said this more than these trousers. Part of Stella McCartney’s last
  collection for Chloé, the horse on the right leg was typical of the playful
  absurdity that she had added to the French brand. The fact that they were on
  TV was perfect for the fashion-literate character that we were getting to
  know, but it was also a genius wink from costume designer Patricia Field to a
  fashion-loving audience who would be able to ID the design. While I have never
  been lucky enough to own a pair – they sell for upwards of £1,665 – I have
  been able to enjoy them again, when Olivia Rodrigo wore a pair in 2023. And I
  have managed, through The Outnet, to score another of McCartney’s
  animal-related offerings: a pair of cat trousers from her autumn/winter 2016
  collection. Lauren Cochrane, senior writer, fashion The see-through cami and
  jorts | season five, episode one Season five gets a lot of flak: Sarah Jessica
  Parker was pregnant, so they only filmed eight episodes. It also meant
  swapping Carrie’s midriff belts and naked dresses for bump-hiding babydoll
  silhouettes and Juicy Couture. And there was the divisive short bob. But this
  was actually my favourite Carrie during a recent rewatch. She embraces
  singledom. I adore the opening episode, the first post-9/11, as she romances
  herself in NYC. She’s at her most candid, too, talking about the loneliness
  that being on her own can come with. It feels like a gear shift in her
  mid-30s, so I have a soft spot for these more out-of-character outfits. Maybe
  it’s last week’s heatwave making me pick this outfit – floaty white cami,
  black bra, long denim shorts, mesh heels, bandana – but I just think she looks
  SO COOL (literally and vibe-wise). It screams freedom – especially for someone
  who suffers tummy bloat on the daily. God bless the day I stopped worrying
  about my mismatched bra being on show. In fact, I have just bought a
  size-too-big cami on Vinted, which I intend to wear with a red Agent
  Provocateur bra that deserves to be seen by all when the sun’s out again. The
  bandana and mesh heels? With total respect, I’ll leave that to gen Z. Hollie
  Richardson, assistant TV editor The cowboy hat and crop top | season two,
  episode 17 This summer might have been the season of peak cowboy fashion, but,
  as usual, Miss Bradshaw did it first (and, let’s face it, better). It’s often
  Carrie’s dresses that get all the glory – the Dior newspaper print, the Oscar
  de la Renta ballgown – but for me, her two-pieces are just as striking. Take
  this look from the Hamptons beach party in the penultimate episode of season
  two: a snakeskin bandeau top, a striped skirt, and a cowboy hat perched on
  top. The effect is simultaneously retro and hyper-modern. There’s something
  90s in the skirt, yet it also has the DNA of the modern festival uniform:
  skin-baring separates, animal print, and of course, the hat. I still think
  about it whenever I’m getting dressed for a festival. It’s proof that
  mismatched textures and prints can add up to something more chic than a
  pristine head-to-toe label moment. It’s a shame the scene that delivered the
  fit is so devastating – Carrie seeing Big with Natasha for the first time,
  and, in response, running down the beach to throw up. Still, she looked damned
  good while doing it. Emma Loffhagen, acting commissioning editor, Saturday
  magazine The Vivienne Westwood green foil miniskirt | season four, episode
  nine Carrie Bradshaw is the queen of the styling detail: ruffled sandals with
  bodycon dresses, berets with pant suits, and sequin bags with everything.
  Every look shines against the concrete NYC backdrop with a ‘cherry on the top’
  styling kiss. But for me, nothing compares to the Vivienne Westwood green foil
  miniskirt with its Playboy bunny ‘tail’ ruffle. The classic white shirt,
  simple chain necklace and red heels shouldn’t work together. Red and green
  should never be seen! It’s not Christmas! But it works – of course it does.
  Classic with a twist is exactly what Carrie does best. Melanie Wilkinson,
  styling editor The white Dior slip dress | season two, episode 18 I adore (pun
  intended) the white Dior slip revenge dress – it has everything: symbolism,
  edge (white! To an engagement party!), a cleavage, a see-through heel and a
  ridiculous bag. (Although I have also enjoyed the Simone Rocha looks in this
  series of AJLT). Jenny Stevens, deputy features editor The pink cap sleeve
  dress | season two, episode 18 At the end of season two, Carrie meets Big in
  an outfit that I have been trying to recreate for the past 18 years. A simple
  pale pink wrap dress, with spiked heels and a sparkly pink handbag. I remember
  seeing the dress for the first time and feeling a longing so intense it was
  like physical pain. I spent the next three years stealing my mother’s
  flesh-coloured nighties and trying to squish my huge feet into her wedding
  shoes. At lunch, Carrie behaves badly – she screams when Big tells her he’s
  marrying his new girlfriend and runs out of the restaurant – her chaos somehow
  cutting through her glamour. I was 15 when I first saw this scene, and Carrie
  looked to me like womanhood. She was cigarettes and heartbreak and screaming
  at your ex over lunch. I’m 33 now, the same age as Carrie was in that scene,
  but she still feels unattainably grown-up to me. I rewatched the scene for the
  thousandth time last night and then spent 75 minutes tracking down a replica
  made and sold by a superfan.. It arrives in a week but I know from bitter
  experience that I won’t look like Carrie in it. I bought a slightly different
  replica pink-Carrie-dress at 18, and at 27, and again at 31. Still, I live in
  hope. Kitty Drake, Guardian researcher The tie-dye cami and printed skirt |
  season two, episode 15 The top is duck-egg blue and purple batik. A
  Pepto-Bismol pink bra Top C’s out from underneath. The skirt’s sky blue is
  laced with a golden print and the bag is baseline red with bouquets of orange.
  Any one of these prints on its own would be a lot. But together, I would
  argue, they’re just enough; their notes somehow find the sweetness of a
  bluegrass harmony – this is Patricia Field (long-time SATC costume designer)
  at the height of her powers. Carrie’s not dressed for family, she says. And
  she’s not, technically. Because dressing to “meet the family” – in this
  instance, of her current flame, the short story writer Vaughn – would
  probably, typically, mean something more pared back. She mightn’t have opted
  for a Playboy bunny necklace, for instance? But that’s just one of the things
  that’s so great about this outfit, beyond how aesthetically lovely I think it
  is. It’s not necessarily what she would have chosen for this meeting, but it
  somehow works. Or maybe more so, it just doesn’t matter, because she’s
  welcomed so openly and sincerely, with lox, an invitation to speak at a
  seminar at Columbia on cultural zeitgeist and a “hey, ’sup” from one of
  Vaughn’s sisters. This was to me something of a revelation. Her ability to
  dismiss feeling inappropriately dressed and find herself embraced and unjudged
  in the bosom of heretofore strangers. It felt thrilling, as someone who has at
  times had anxieties about the idea of finding myself wearing an outfit I
  hadn’t planned to wear in a given situation, like bumping into an old boss
  wearing my moseying-up-the-street getup – a baggy T-shirt, some kind of
  jogging bottoms and Birkenstocks, say. It sounds inane (and maybe it is) but I
  think some of it has to do with looking to clothes to lend you confidence
  rather than feeling it intrinsically. Wearing the wrong thing at the wrong
  time, for someone struggling with feeling comfortable in their own skin, is a
  recipe for a crumble. Sense of self shouldn’t be this fragile and yet
  sometimes it is. So seeing Carrie brush it off felt genuinely refreshing –
  emboldening, even. Plus, this episode has the line, “No one who went
  sleeveless ever won a Pulitzer,” in it, and that’s great too. Ellie Violet
  Bramley, freelance writer The Prada co-ord | season four, episode one One of
  my favourite Carrie Bradshaw looks has to be the red Prada co-ord she wore for
  her 35th birthday. The outfit itself is exquisite and combines one of my
  favourite styling techniques, monochrome fashion (I have blue and black Issey
  Miyake two-pieces, which I wear like a uniform) and strategic exposures of
  skin: the top of the outfit is long sleeved, but it is cropped, exposing her
  midriff. But mostly I love this look because it speaks to the experience of
  public humiliation while wearing incredibly beautiful clothing. Nobody turns
  up to Carrie’s birthday dinner, and on her way home she drops her birthday
  cake on the street, scooping it up with cardboard while being shouted at by
  construction workers. I remember once wearing a viscose Martine Rose suit and,
  strutting through the middle of Waterloo, stacking over myself so badly that
  people came over to help me up. I also once got into a shouting match with a
  rude stranger on the tube while wearing a Bode jacket that had a donkey sewn
  on the back with colourful string. In my delusion I hope that witnesses
  thought, “He might be caught embarrassing himself but he’d never be caught
  dead in a bad outfit.” Jason Okundaye, assistant newsletter editor and writer
