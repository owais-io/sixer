  It began with a good-natured rant about the Scottish summer weather and has
  developed into a global conversation about history, diaspora and diversity on
  both sides of the Atlantic. Last week, Torgi Squire uploaded a TikTok post
  that any Scottish parent could relate to: why is it, he asked, that without
  fail the washout summer weather always improves the week that the kids go back
  to school? The 43-year-old high school teacher from Glasgow ended with his
  usual sign-off, wishing everyone “a belter of a day”, and thought nothing more
  of it. The internet had other ideas. The post was picked up by a US weather
  reporter and Squire’s comments were suddenly filling with African Americans
  expressing their amazement and delight at discovering a black man with a
  strong Scottish accent. But it didn’t stop there: black Scots on TikTok found
  themselves flooded with questions from their American cousins and seized the
  opportunity to respond with high calibre banter, as #blackscottishtiktok
  generated thousands more posts. “It’s been a whirlwind,” said Squire, who
  teaches design and technology. His original post has racked up nearly 4m
  views, and he’s since welcomed more than 200,000 new followers. “Americans are
  kept in a bit of an echo chamber by their media, and their only point of
  reference for Scotland is either Braveheart, Brave or Shrek. They don’t seem
  to have much awareness of the diaspora, particularly when it comes to the UK,
  which is maybe why they’ve reacted with so much curiosity. “But it’s not just
  Americans. I’ve had comments from people in England too, so there’s still
  surprise at a black person with a Scottish accent on both sides of the
  Atlantic.” Scotland is certainly more diverse than when he was growing up in
  the 1980s – “of the 1,400 kids at my secondary school, only four were black
  and three of them were related to me”. “In my experience Scotland is a
  welcoming place and while there is still racism, it’s isolated and Scottish
  people are very good at calling it out. Perhaps because there are far fewer
  black people than somewhere like America, we tend to treat each other more
  like community.” When Ellie Koepplinger, 28, who posts about race and politics
  on TikTok, saw the initial interest in Squire’s content, she thought: “This is
  going to be huge. “Then other black Scottish people started to chime in and it
  was really exciting.” Koepplinger, who grew up in Glasgow and lived in the US
  for nine years, added her own post about being mixed heritage in Scotland: “It
  feels like finally people are understanding that we have our own racial
  politics.” But the interest from across the Atlantic has a more practical
  edge, she suggested: “Trump has made America so hostile to black people that
  having so many people talking about their positive experience in Scotland has
  got a huge amount of interest from people who are really keen to leave the
  States.” The flurry of content had also prompted some fruitful conversations
  among black Scots themselves, she added. “It’s been really interesting to hear
  other Scottish people talk about the racism and the challenges they’ve
  experienced in Scotland. The black community in Scotland is fairly fragmented
  because it’s small, but it’s a population that’s excited to grow.” Manny
  Daphey, a 20-year-old student, soon found his own content getting pushed by
  the TikTok algorithm, doubling his following as Americans flocked to his
  videos. “I was pretty blown by surprise, suddenly everyone was interacting and
  it felt like speaking to my long-lost cousins.” A few negative comments have
  been vastly outweighed by a barrage of positivity, he says: “Lots of Americans
  are very intrigued about living in Scotland, saying they want to visit.”
  Perhaps inevitably, there are also some women who appreciate a handsome face
  with a Scottish accent. American women can be “very direct” he says. When Roy
  Wood Jr, comedian and host of CNN’s Have I Got News For You US, arrived in
  Edinburgh a few days ago, he was ready to take in some shows at the festival.
  Instead, he’s been diverted on to a TikTok odyssey, travelling across the
  central belt to interview black Scots and prove to his fellow Americans they
  do indeed exist. In one of his posts Wood makes the point that part of the
  reason why black Americans don’t know about black Scots is because their
  schools “barely teach them about black people in America”, adding: “People can
  laugh about dumb Americans not knowing there are black people in Scotland but
  this tells us a lot about the differences between education systems and what
  governments define as history.” In his interviews with Scottish creators, Wood
  says a common thread is the sense that black Scots are suddenly able to
  connect online in a way that wasn’t so familiar in the real world. “Coming
  from the States, I found there’s no black neighbourhood, no exclusive cultural
  enclave for black people in Scotland, so there was a common feeling of ‘now
  we’ve found each other’.” Wood tracked down Squire in Glasgow and the pair
  made a post together. “It’s an opportunity for black people across the whole
  diaspora to converse with one another.” “The conversations I’ve had in the
  past week have really enriched my life,” added Squire. “It makes me happy that
  people are coming together.”
