  … and on that note, it’s a wrap! Ukraine’s parliament has passed a law
  restoring independence to two anti-corruption bodies, essentially annulling
  another law adopted last week that prompted the biggest street protests since
  Russia’s full-scale invasion three years ago (12:20, 12:48, 13:06, 14:06). The
  EU has welcomed the move, with European Commission president Ursula von der
  Leyen saying that restoring the independence of the agencies was “a welcome
  step,” and insisting that “Ukraine’s rule of law and anti-corruption reforms
  should continue” (12:38, 12:59, 15:08) The legislative reform came just hours
  after another night of heavy attacks on Kyiv, with at least eight dead and
  over 120 injured (10:51, 11:16, 11:41), with Ukrainian president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy suggesting the need for a “regime change” in Moscow to stop its
  imperial ambitions (9:33, 9:57). Elsewhere, Lithuanian prime minister
  Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from the post after growing questions over the
  alleged irregularities in dealings and financing of his company (10:35).
  Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson urged the European Union to suspend the
  trade component of the bloc’s association agreement with Israel, saying the
  country was failing to meet its obligations on humanitarian aid in Gaza
  (10:55). Portuguese prime minister Luís Montenegro said Portugal would
  consider recognising the Palestinian state at the UN general assembly meeting
  in September (14:24). And that’s all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today. If you
  have any tips, comments or suggestions, email me at

  and on X at @jakubkrupa. Angelique Chrisafis in Paris and Lisa O’Carroll in
  Brussels The French government has said it is closely monitoring a US plan to
  destroy millions of dollars of contraceptives stocked in Europe after outrage
  from French feminists, rights groups and family planning organisations at what
  they called a wasteful attack on women’s rights. The Guardian reported this
  month that Donald Trump’s administration planned to destroy $9.7m of
  contraceptives that are believed to be in a warehouse in Belgium but may be
  moved to France for incineration. They are mostly long-acting contraceptives
  such as IUDs and birth control implants, which had been bought under public
  health programmes run by the US Agency for International Development and were
  probably intended for women in Africa. A US state department spokesperson told
  Agence France-Presse this week that “a preliminary decision was made to
  destroy” certain birth control products from “terminated Biden-era USAID
  contracts”. Trump’s administration dismantled USAID, the country’s foreign aid
  armbody, in January. The spokesperson said the destruction would cost $167,000
  and “no HIV medications or condoms are being destroyed”. The contraceptives,
  stored in a warehouse in Geel in Belgium, were reportedly planned to be
  incinerated in France, although there has been no confirmation of this by
  France. France and Belgium are under pressure to prevent any destruction. The
  French health ministry said in a statement: “We are following this situation
  closely and we support the will of the Belgian authorities to find a solution
  to avoid the destruction of contraceptives. The defence of sexual health and
  reproductive rights is a foreign policy priority for France. This week a
  collective of rights groups, feminists organisations and trade unions in
  France launched a petition to stop the destruction of the contraceptives. “We
  won’t allow this unfair and sexist decision to go ahead, it’s both an economic
  and human waste,” they said. In other Brussels news, European Commission
  president Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the fast-tracked adoption of the new
  Ukrainian law earlier today. In a post on social media, she said that
  “president Zelenskyy’s signature on the law restoring Nabu &amp; Sapo
  independence is a welcome step.” “Ukraine’s rule of law and anti-corruption
  reforms should continue. They remain essential for Ukraine’s progress on the
  European path. The EU will continue to support these efforts,” she said.
  European Council president António Costa also published the same text,
  word-for-word. in Brussels EU exports of wines and spirits will face a 15%
  tariff from tomorrow after an exemption failed to be agreed ahead of 1 August,
  Donald Trump’s deadline for trade deals. The move is a setback for wine makers
  in France, Spain and Italy and elsewhere along with the Irish whiskey sector
  which relies heavily on the US for sales. European Commission officials said
  they are continuing to negotiate carve outs for wine and spirits and for steel
  but talks were ongoing. “The Commission remains determined to achieve and
  secure the maximum carve outs, including for traditional EU products such as
  wine and spirits. It is not our expectation that wine and spirits will be
  included in the first group announced by the US tomorrow, therefore those
  products will be captured by the 15 per cent ceiling,” said trade spokesperson
  Olof Gill. The deal between Washington and Brussels agreed a ceiling of 15%
  tariff for most EU imports with some exemptions in both directions including
  aviation and aircraft parts and some non-sensitive agricultural produce such
  as nuts and petfood. “EU and US negotiators are, as agreed, working to
  finalise the joint statement, building on the agreement reached. We will
  communicate more precise timings to you when these are known in the event more
  time is required to finalise the joint statement beyond 1 August,” said Gill.
  With negotiations on the detailed list of exemptions ongoing, doubts have been
  raised that the expected joint statement will not be signed off ahead of
  tomorrow’s deadline. The EU however expects the US to press ahead with its
  side of the deal, likely to be through an executive order, given it has
  already published the headline deal. He added: “It is the clear understanding
  of the European Union that the US will implement the agreed across -the-board
  tariff ceiling of 15%. It is also our clear understanding that the US will
  implement the exemptions to the 15% ceiling, as outlined by President von der
  Leyen last Sunday.” Gill pointed out that the joint statement is not a legally
  binding text and more of a “roadmap”. The car sector is the most immediate
  beneficiary as it was facing import duties of 27.5%. But pharmaceuticals had
  been rated at zero tax under a long standing World Trade Organization
  agreement centred on keep costs of medicines down globally. Portugal will
  consider recognising the Palestinian state at the United Nations General
  Assembly in September, the country’s prime minister Luís Montenegro said. A
  statement from his office, reported by RTP and Publico, said that the
  government would consult the country’s president and party leaders “with a
  view to considering the recognition” in September. The movement comes just
  days after Portugal co-signed a declaration of intent alongside numerous other
  European countries, such as Andorra, Finland, Ireland, Malta, and Slovenia
  (yesterday’s blog). Canada, France, and the UK are among other countries that
  have openly suggested over the past week that they could move with the formal
  recognition in September. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has just
  confirmed he signed the anti-corruption reform into law as he thanked
  parliamentarians for passing the bill. “This guarantees the normal,
  independent work of anti-corruption bodies and all law enforcement agencies in
  our country. It is the right decision,” he said. He also acknowledges that “it
  is very important that the state listens to public opinion,” acknowledging
  recent protests. “Ukraine is a democracy – there is no doubt about that.
  Government officials will also immediately inform Ukraine’s partners about
  this law,” he said. Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko said the reform
  adopted today by the country’s parliament is “a direct and responsible
  response to the expectations of Ukrainian society and our European partners.”
  “It confirms Ukraine’s commitment to democratic governance, the rule of law,
  and institutional maturity. As the Government, we will now communicate this
  important step to all of our international partners. Strengthening the rule of
  law remains central to our reform agenda and to Ukraine’s European future,”
  she said. The reform was welcomed by some EU leaders, with Estonian prime
  minister Kristen Michal “welcoming” the decision, and saying “this will help
  pave the way for the European future that Ukrainians are working and fighting
  for.” Here are some more pictures showing the aftermath of Russian attacks on
  Kyiv overnight, captured for us by Jędrzej Nowicki. Ukrainian foreign minister
  Andrii Sybiha has reacted to the parliament’s vote on social media, saying the
  law “demonstrates a princpled approach” and that “Ukraine is commited to
  reforms and the fight against corruption on our path to the EU and Nato.” “We
  got it fixed,” he said. The European Commission has just offered its longer
  reaction to the Ukrainian vote. Its enlargement spokesperson Guillaume Mercier
  said: “What I can say is that the EU has clearly raised strong concerns about
  the adoption of the amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code in Ukraine last
  week. Since then, we have been in close contact with Ukrainian authorities to
  remedy the situation. So our messages all along have been really clear,
  Ukraine must build on this solid foundation as a future EU member state, and
  must preserve the independent anti corruption bodies which are the
  cornerstones of Ukraine’s rule of law. When it comes to today’s vote, which
  has taken place a few minutes ago in the Rada, so the Rada has restored key
  safeguards ensuring the independence of the anti corruption bodies. In our
  view, the new law addresses the key challenges of Nabu and Sapu independence.
  We will, however, need to check the final text as it has just been adopted.
  Let me, however, underline that this is not the end of the process. Ukraine’s
  accession will require continuous efforts to guarantee a strong capacity to
  combat corruption and to respect, rule of law. We expect Ukraine to deliver on
  those commitments swiftly and take decisive steps on rule of law.” Listing
  specific issues, he said the EU expected Ukraine “to proceed with the swift
  appointment of the head of the economic security bureau of Ukraine, … restore
  the international experts in the high qualification commission of judges
  selection committee [and] to proceed with the appointment of four
  international, vetted judges to the constitutional court … and discard the
  problematic draft amendments to the criminal code and pass the administrative
  court law.” He also confirmed there were no plans on freezing EU funds for
  Ukraine. in Kyiv Ukraine’s parliament has passed a law restoring independence
  to two anti-corruption bodies, essentially annulling another passed law last
  week that prompted the biggest street protests since Russia’s full-scale
  invasion three years ago. When news of the vote broke, cheers erupted among a
  crowd that had gathered in a park close to parliament, the latest in a set of
  protests over the past week, predominantly attended by young Ukrainians. The
  law passed with 331 votes in favour and none against, a rapid U-turn from the
  bill which passed last week with support from president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s
  Servant of the People party. The parliamentary session was televised for the
  first time since 2022, lifting a ban on filming for security reasons.
  Opposition MPs made fiery speeches criticising Zelenskyy and the presidential
  administration before the vote. EU enlargmenent commissioner Marta Kos
  welcomed the vote in the Ukrainian parliament saying that “today’s law
  restores key safeguards, but challenges remain.” Here is her reaction in full:
  “The Rada corrected last week’s damaging vote undermining NABU’s &amp; SAPO’s
  independence. Today’s law restores key safeguards, but challenges remain. The
  EU supports citizens’ demands for reform. Upholding fundamental values &amp;
  fighting corruption must remain the priority.” As the vote took place, crowds
  of demonstrators gathered outside the parliament, calling for a swift adoption
  of the new law. Just as expected (10:51, 11:19). Notably, 331 votes in favour,
  zero against. Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko just posted an update
  after overnight attacks on Kyiv, saying that the death toll from the strikes
  rose to eight as rescue efforts “continue across several districts” of the
  capital. More than eighty people were injured, she added. She said: “This is
  how the Kremlin responds to calls for peace: with deliberate terror and the
  systematic targeting of Ukraine’s civilian population. Putin is not seeking a
  solution. He is testing the world’s resolve, continuing to receive
  confirmation that mass murder has no real consequences.” She called for more
  pressure on Russia’s war economy, full synchronisation of sanctions imposed
  against Moscow, and reinforcement of Ukraine’s air defences. “Peace will not
  come through delay,” she said. Separately, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s most senior
  aide, Andriy Yermak, is recently more active online, responding to assertive
  statements from Russian politicians. In his latest post he took aim at the
  former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who earlier this week dismissed
  Trump’s threat of sanctions against Russia as “a theatrical ultimatum” and
  insisting “Russia didn’t care.” He replied with a film reference to a scene in
  the 1997 Air Force One movie and a warning: “America doesn’t tolerate. America
  strikes back.” Ukraine’s Sybiha was also asked about the anti-corruption law
  reform that prompted protests in Ukraine, as mentioned by Shaun earlier
  (10:51). He defended the overhaul, while saying the Ukrainian government
  listened to criticism and that he hoped the revised bill would be passed by
  the country’s parliament today. He said: “We have Russian brutal aggression,
  but we are committed to the reforms. Of course, we are hearing the reaction of
  our society. Of course, we are hearing the reaction of our international
  partners, but we are committed to the fight with corruption. That’s our
  national interest, and because of security concerns, because of necessity to
  keep balance … influence of Russia on some bodies, this bill was initiated,
  and by the way, we expect that this bill will be approved today in our
  parliament.” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha is talking at the
  Helsinki+50 conference now, following earlier speech by president Volodymyr
  Zelenskyy (9:57). “Unfortunately, president, me, we must start every speech
  with the [same] words [that] today Kyiv was [again] under attack, that today
  Ukraine was heavily attacked, we have casualties today, several or many
  civilian children were killed,” he said, saying it points to a failure of the
  postwar order to stop similar aggressions. He’s then made this powerful point:
  “I am confident that Ukrainian security and European security, they are
  indivisible, that it also means collective responsibility. … History has never
  ended: not after Helsinki, not after the Berlin Wall fell, and probably
  altogether [never]. We are writing now our history and the main ink for
  European history now is the blood of my compatriots, of Ukrainian people.”
  Elsewhere, the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, urged the European
  Union to suspend the trade component of the bloc’s association agreement with
  Israel. In a post on social media, he said “the situation in Gaza is utterly
  deplorable, and Israel is not fulfilling its most basic obligations and
  agreed-upon commitments regarding humanitarian aid.” He said: “Sweden
  therefore demands that the EU, as soon as possible, freezes the trade
  component of the association agreement. Economic pressure on Israel must
  increase. The Israeli government must allow unrestricted humanitarian aid in
  Gaza.” He added: “At the same time, pressure on Hamas must increase so that
  the hostages are released immediately and unconditionally. Sweden welcomes the
  fact that more countries in the Middle East are demanding that Hamas be
  disarmed and not have a role in the future governance of Gaza.” in Kyiv
  Explosions rang out for hours, making it another sleepless night for many in
  the Ukrainian capital before a crucial parliamentary vote on Thursday on
  legislation to restore independence to two anti-corruption bodies. The bill,
  if passed, would essentially undo a law passed last week that curtailed their
  powers and led to a political crisis. The surprise changes prompted rare
  wartime street protests against the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and
  accusations that his office was trying to protect powerful associates from
  anti-corruption investigations. Zelenskyy announced late last week that he had
  listened to the criticism expressed at a series of street protests and from
  various western officials and would table a new law. Lithuanian prime minister
  Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from the post after growing questions over the
  alleged irregularities in dealings and financing of his company, with
  coalition partners threatening to leave the government if he remained in post.
  While denying any allegations of impropriety aired in the media, Paluckas went
  on two-week leave, and then decided to resign on Thursday morning. Lithuania’s
  president Gitanas Nausėda confirmed he received the resignation on Thursday
  morning, welcoming it as the right choice, LRT reported. The internal
  government discussions will now begin to pick the successor, with deputy
  parliament speaker Jouzas Olekas, Vilnius mayor Robert Duchnevič and social
  security and labour minister Inga Ruginienė among the top candidates. Over the
  last half hour, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Finnish
  Helsinki+50 conference marking the 50th anniversary of the 1975 Helsinki
  accords. He said that “Russia keeps launching such attacks, even when the
  whole world is calling on it to stop the war, a war that Russia started, a war
  that Russia keeps dragging on, a war that only the Russian leadership wants.”
  He did not mince his words as he accused Russian leadership of being “mentally
  stuck in another century, a time of brutal violence … [and] total disregard
  for human rights and equality.” “We know that such ideas and such times must
  never return to Europe,” he said. He said that “a total rejection of the
  post-second world war world … is the foundation of the current regime in
  Russia,” but that Moscow “can be pushed to stop this war.” “We need to fully
  block Russia’s war machine, cut off its arms industry, limit its energy
  profits, and finally, put every frozen Russian asset including stolen wealth …
  to work, defending against the Russian aggression. It’s time to confiscate the
  Russian assets, not just freeze them … to use them to serve peace, not war.”
  But he warned: “But if the world doesn’t aim to change the regime in Russia,
  that means, even after the war ends, Moscow will still try to destabilise
  neighbouring countries.” Zelenskyy also pointedly helped Finnish president
  Alex Stubb and US president Donald Trump, saying that “Trump is truly
  interested in ending the war and we have to do everything we can to make sure
  the US and Europe act together for security.” Another night, another series of
  attacks on Ukrainian cities as Russia appears unfazed by the US threat of
  sanctions and secondary tariffs on its allies if it does not stop its invasion
  of Ukraine. At least six people died, including a six-year-old boy, and 50
  were injured in overnight attacks in Kyiv and across the country. The
  Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called the attacks “showcase
  killings” as he urged Ukraine’s allies to push Moscow “to come to a real
  negotiating table” saying “all the tools needed for this are in the hands of
  our partners.” We are counting on everything now being voiced by America and
  Europe toward this goal to be fulfilled. Zelenskyy’s most senior aide, Andriy
  Yermak, went further in his comments, calling Russia “a terrorist state.” He
  added: “Putin is showing the world that he’s not afraid and intends to keep
  killing our people — our children. Sanctions and weapons are what’s needed.
  I’m confident the U.S. and President @POTUS will stand by the principle of
  ‘peace through strength.’” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called
  on Trump to not wait until 8 August and reduce his deadline for a Russian
  ceasefire “to zero”. “Putin does it on purpose. He does not care about any
  attempts to put an end to the killing. He only seeks to destroy and kill.
  Because the entire existence of this war criminal is based on this senseless
  war, which he cannot win but refuses to end. He must face justice. It’s time
  to make him feel the pain and consequences of his choices. It’s time to put
  maximum pressure on Moscow. It is time to synchronise all sanctions steps.
  It’s time to achieve peace through strength.” I will bring you all key updates
  from across Europe here. It’s Thursday, 31 July 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here,
  and this is Europe Live. Good morning.

More than eighty people were injured, she added. She said: “This is how the Kremlin responds to calls for peace: with deliberate terror and the systematic targeting of Ukraine’s civilian population. Putin is not seeking a solution. He is testing the world’s resolve, continuing to receive confirmation that mass murder has no real consequences.” She called for more pressure on Russia’s war economy, full synchronisation of sanctions imposed against Moscow, and reinforcement of Ukraine’s air defences. “Peace will not come through delay,” she said. Separately, Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s most senior aide, Andriy Yermak, is recently more active online, responding to assertive statements from Russian politicians. In his latest post he took aim at the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who earlier this week dismissed Trump’s threat of sanctions against Russia as “a theatrical ultimatum” and insisting “Russia didn’t care.” He replied with a film reference to a scene in the 1997 Air Force One movie and a warning: “America doesn’t tolerate. America strikes back.” Ukraine’s Sybiha was also asked about the anti-corruption law reform that prompted protests in Ukraine, as mentioned by Shaun earlier (10:51). He defended the overhaul, while saying the Ukrainian government listened to criticism and that he hoped the revised bill would be passed by the country’s parliament today. He said: “We have Russian brutal aggression, but we are committed to the reforms. Of course, we are hearing the reaction of our society. Of course, we are hearing the reaction of our international partners, but we are committed to the fight with corruption. That’s our national interest, and because of security concerns, because of necessity to keep balance … influence of Russia on some bodies, this bill was initiated, and by the way, we expect that this bill will be approved today in our parliament.” Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha is talking at the Helsinki+50 conference now, following earlier speech by president Volodymyr Zelenskyy (9:57). “Unfortunately, president, me, we must start every speech with the [same] words [that] today Kyiv was [again] under attack, that today Ukraine was heavily attacked, we have casualties today, several or many civilian children were killed,” he said, saying it points to a failure of the postwar order to stop similar aggressions. He’s then made this powerful point: “I am confident that Ukrainian security and European security, they are indivisible, that it also means collective responsibility. … History has never ended: not after Helsinki, not after the Berlin Wall fell, and probably altogether [never]. We are writing now our history and the main ink for European history now is the blood of my compatriots, of Ukrainian people.” Elsewhere, the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, urged the European Union to suspend the trade component of the bloc’s association agreement with Israel. In a post on social media, he said “the situation in Gaza is utterly deplorable, and Israel is not fulfilling its most basic obligations and agreed-upon commitments regarding humanitarian aid.” He said: “Sweden therefore demands that the EU, as soon as possible, freezes the trade component of the association agreement. Economic pressure on Israel must increase. The Israeli government must allow unrestricted humanitarian aid in Gaza.” He added: “At the same time, pressure on Hamas must increase so that the hostages are released immediately and unconditionally. Sweden welcomes the fact that more countries in the Middle East are demanding that Hamas be disarmed and not have a role in the future governance of Gaza.” in Kyiv Explosions rang out for hours, making it another sleepless night for many in the Ukrainian capital before a crucial parliamentary vote on Thursday on legislation to restore independence to two anti-corruption bodies. The bill, if passed, would essentially undo a law passed last week that curtailed their powers and led to a political crisis. The surprise changes prompted rare wartime street protests against the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and accusations that his office was trying to protect powerful associates from anti-corruption investigations. Zelenskyy announced late last week that he had listened to the criticism expressed at a series of street protests and from various western officials and would table a new law. Lithuanian prime minister Gintautas Paluckas has resigned from the post after growing questions over the alleged irregularities in dealings and financing of his company, with coalition partners threatening to leave the government if he remained in post. While denying any allegations of impropriety aired in the media, Paluckas went on two-week leave, and then decided to resign on Thursday morning. Lithuania’s president Gitanas Nausėda confirmed he received the resignation on Thursday morning, welcoming it as the right choice, LRT reported. The internal government discussions will now begin to pick the successor, with deputy parliament speaker Jouzas Olekas, Vilnius mayor Robert Duchnevič and social security and labour minister Inga Ruginienė among the top candidates. Over the last half hour, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the Finnish Helsinki+50 conference marking the 50th anniversary of the 1975 Helsinki accords. He said that “Russia keeps launching such attacks, even when the whole world is calling on it to stop the war, a war that Russia started, a war that Russia keeps dragging on, a war that only the Russian leadership wants.” He did not mince his words as he accused Russian leadership of being “mentally stuck in another century, a time of brutal violence … [and] total disregard for human rights and equality.” “We know that such ideas and such times must never return to Europe,” he said. He said that “a total rejection of the post-second world war world … is the foundation of the current regime in Russia,” but that Moscow “can be pushed to stop this war.” “We need to fully block Russia’s war machine, cut off its arms industry, limit its energy profits, and finally, put every frozen Russian asset including stolen wealth … to work, defending against the Russian aggression. It’s time to confiscate the Russian assets, not just freeze them … to use them to serve peace, not war.” But he warned: “But if the world doesn’t aim to change the regime in Russia, that means, even after the war ends, Moscow will still try to destabilise neighbouring countries.” Zelenskyy also pointedly helped Finnish president Alex Stubb and US president Donald Trump, saying that “Trump is truly interested in ending the war and we have to do everything we can to make sure the US and Europe act together for security.” Another night, another series of attacks on Ukrainian cities as Russia appears unfazed by the US threat of sanctions and secondary tariffs on its allies if it does not stop its invasion of Ukraine. At least six people died, including a six-year-old boy, and 50 were injured in overnight attacks in Kyiv and across the country. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, called the attacks “showcase killings” as he urged Ukraine’s allies to push Moscow “to come to a real negotiating table” saying “all the tools needed for this are in the hands of our partners.” We are counting on everything now being voiced by America and Europe toward this goal to be fulfilled. Zelenskyy’s most senior aide, Andriy Yermak, went further in his comments, calling Russia “a terrorist state.” He added: “Putin is showing the world that he’s not afraid and intends to keep killing our people — our children. Sanctions and weapons are what’s needed. I’m confident the U.S. and President @POTUS will stand by the principle of ‘peace through strength.’” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, called on Trump to not wait until 8 August and reduce his deadline for a Russian ceasefire “to zero”. “Putin does it on purpose. He does not care about any attempts to put an end to the killing. He only seeks to destroy and kill. Because the entire existence of this war criminal is based on this senseless war, which he cannot win but refuses to end. He must face justice. It’s time to make him feel the pain and consequences of his choices. It’s time to put maximum pressure on Moscow. It is time to synchronise all sanctions steps. It’s time to achieve peace through strength.” I will bring you all key updates from across Europe here. It’s Thursday, 31 July 2025, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning.
