  A gentle sweep of the arms outwards, an unsettling silence and then the slow
  bloom of a bottom-heavy minor chord in the strings. More than a century after
  audiences were taught to fall silent as standard, most concerts continue to
  begin emphatically, with the musical equivalent of a teacher calling a new
  reception class to order. But the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s 10th outing this
  Proms season – this time under composer-conductor Thomas Adès – was an
  altogether subtler affair. Sibelius’s tone poem The Swan of Tuonela provided
  that beguilingly unhurried start. The strings settled, featherlike, into a
  light, luminous backdrop over which the cor anglais twisted and soared.
  Reaching forwards and upwards, hands outstretched, Adès held the orchestra as
  if under a spell: the brass, seeming to float from a great distance, the
  strings’ eventual unison melody calm and spacious. The UK premiere of
  Breathing Forests, an organ concerto by California composer Gabriella Smith
  burst into life in a colourful splash of tremolo and repetitions, the strings
  and upper woodwind in near-constant motion while sustained notes from organist
  James McVinnie and the BBCSO brass provided some sense of larger-scale shape.
  Amid periodic swathes of Philip Glass-style arpeggios, there were more
  intriguing details: strange squeals and pitch bends, brashly tonal chords that
  disintegrated on landing, the glacial creaking of bows pressed into strings,
  cluster chords as if a toddler had been let loose on the organ manuals. Much
  of the work was densely orchestrated, Smith generating a kind of
  ecosystem-in-motion – more persuasive as a vivid soundscape than as a finite
  structure. After the interval came two musical responses to Shakespeare’s The
  Tempest. Adès’s own Five Spells from The Tempest ran the gamut from the
  storm’s seething, noisy swerves and lurches via Ariel’s mercurial, angular
  woodwind to hints of elegant courtly dances for Ferdinand and Miranda.
  Sibelius’s The Tempest – Suite No 1 (among his last completed works) featured
  still more radical switches of atmosphere, between bland folksiness and a
  remarkably lean, bold modernism. Adès presided like Prospero himself,
  relentlessly engaging as he conjured evanescent woodwind solos and symphonic
  textures of fearless, squally aggression. • Listen again on BBC Sounds until
  12 October. The Proms continue until 13 September.
