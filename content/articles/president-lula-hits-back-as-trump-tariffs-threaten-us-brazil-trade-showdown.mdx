  Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has said he does not fear
  getting on the wrong side of Donald Trump, as South America’s largest economy
  braces for the introduction of 50% tariffs. Trump announced plans to slap
  Brazil with tariffs on 1 August earlier this month, partly in retaliation for
  a supposed political “witch-hunt” against his far-right ally Jair Bolsonaro.
  The former Brazilian president faces decades in jail for allegedly plotting a
  military coup to stop Lula from taking office after the former lost the 2022
  presidential election. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order
  confirming that the US would impose 50% tariffs on Brazil. The order did not
  mention the previously-cited 1 August deadline, but indicated that the new
  duty would be enforced from next week. In a rare interview with the New York
  Times, clearly designed to send a message to the White House on the eve of a
  potential trade war, Lula urged the US president to avoid creating a
  “lose-lose” relationship between two of the largest economies in the Americas
  and said he did not fear publicly criticizing Trump, whom he recently called
  an “emperor”. “There’s no reason to be afraid. I am worried, obviously,
  because we have economic interests, political interests, technological
  interests. But at no point will Brazil negotiate as if it were a small country
  up against a big country. Brazil will negotiate as a sovereign country,” said
  Lula, who has enjoyed a bounce in the polls after Trump’s threat. Lula
  indicated his officials were willing to negotiate economic issues with the US:
  “In politics between two states, the will of neither should prevail. We always
  need to find the middle ground. This is achieved not by puffing out your chest
  and shouting about things you can’t deliver, nor by bowing your head and
  simply saying ‘amen’ to whatever the United States wants.” But Brazil’s
  president indicated that the political future of Bolsonaro – whose plot
  allegedly included plans to assassinate Lula – was a judicial matter and
  therefore non-negotiable. “Brazil has a constitution, and the former president
  is being tried with a full right to a defense,” Lula insisted. The 79-year-old
  leftist said his message for Trump was “that Brazilians and Americans do not
  deserve to be victims of politics, if the reason President Trump is imposing
  this tax on Brazil is because of the case against former President Bolsonaro”.
  Trump’s decision to cite Bolsonaro’s plight as one of the main justifications
  for his move against Brazil has left many observers doubting that the “Trump
  always chickens out” (Taco) maxim will apply to the Friday deadline facing
  Lula’s government. The US president has likened Bolsonaro’s “disgraceful”
  treatment to attempts to prosecute him after he unsuccessfully tried to
  overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. Bolsonaro has denied
  plotting a coup but has admitted seeking “alternative ways” of stopping Lula
  from taking power. “I’d be very surprised if Trump pulled back in this case,
  not just because of his friendship with the Bolsonaro family … but above all
  because in Trump’s mind it reflects his own trauma,” the American Brazil
  specialist Brian Winter told the Estado de São Paulo newspaper this week. Lula
  hinted he believed a retreat might be possible, comparing the current
  situation to unfounded fears over the millennium bug. “Do you remember when we
  were about to turn from 1999 to 2000, and there was worldwide panic that the
  computer systems were going to crash? Nothing happened,” said Lula, although
  he admitted he could not be certain “nothing will happen”.
