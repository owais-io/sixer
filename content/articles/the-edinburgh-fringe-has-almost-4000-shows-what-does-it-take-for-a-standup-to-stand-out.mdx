  The Edinburgh fringe is in full swing and I’m looking for my posters. Which,
  given the function of a poster, doesn’t bode well for the marketing of my new
  standup hour. The festival has almost 4,000 shows, all jostling for attention,
  so bringing promotional material to the city this month can feel like chucking
  wads of cash into the sea. This year, my show is called My Apologies to the
  Chef, so I’ve gone with a photo in which I’m doing a kooky grin as my head is
  served on a silver platter under a cloche. Hilarious stuff, yes, but I feel
  apprehensive about the theme – largely because my show includes no mention of
  chefs or catering. Registration for the fringe typically happens around March,
  when a show might have included a large section about restaurants, for
  example, which has since been removed. It’s how you end up with an aesthetic
  that is far more culinary than is ideal. The other issue is that grin. Goofy
  faces on standup comedy posters are passe, I’m told. It’s all about moody
  lighting and nonchalant poses these days. One of the poster designers behind
  this cool trend is Jonny Woolley. “I have always had a pet peeve for comedians
  doing funny faces on their posters,” he says. “It’s always been such a
  turn-off for me.” Oh, no. “When I started making posters nearly a decade ago,
  no comedy posters looked cool,” says Woolley. “And I was really influenced by
  album art and movie posters. I hate when comedy posters are just goofy. There
  are so many posters of comedians sitting on the toilet. I’m interested in
  trying to make art for the posters that feels like it could be a more
  longstanding representation of that show.” Woolley, who is also a co-founder
  of the clown ensemble Stamptown, is interested in lending a “legitimacy” to
  the art of comedy through his designs. In parliament this month, a select
  committee of MPs called upon the government to recognise live comedy as an art
  form. As comedy is becoming more businesslike, apparently so is its marketing.
  One of Woolley’s clients this year is the musical comedian Jordan Gray, who
  Jonny tells me is “very hands on” in the design of her posters. Gray wanted
  her photo (shot by Dylan Woodley) to match her on stage persona – an image of
  unbridled rock star ego. “I like having a stupid title and a picture that
  makes you think that I’m very, very serious about this,” Gray says. “That lack
  of self-awareness is quite funny.” Michael Julings, another prolific fringe
  poster designer, says simplicity is key to standing out at the fringe. So many
  posters are cluttered with stars, quotes, QR codes and subtitles. While you
  might think these accolades would sell tickets, it really creates a kind of
  “patchwork effect” when the posters are presented together, he says. Every
  year, the effort to stand out results in small, random coincidences. This
  year, stand-ups Alex Kitson, Daniel McKeon and Aaron Wood all use Post-it
  notes as a visual motif in their publicity photos. Two years ago, Julings
  recalls, six different acts’ posters included dogs for some reason. “The
  busier it is, the more it fades,” says Julings. “A good example of this is the
  most ubiquitous design of last summer, which is the green Charli xcx Brat
  album cover. I remember seeing all the Mercury nominees in a grid, with all
  this beautiful artwork that’s been made independent of each other. But the
  only one that stands out is the block of green.” It’s hard to equate selling
  50 tickets to a fringe show with a multimillion-pound marketing campaign, but
  the Brat influence can be seen on the streets of Edinburgh this year. An
  obvious example is Ivo Graham’s direct parody, which says “Ivo” in the same
  typography with an orange background. Meanwhile, Vittorio Angelone has used
  text-only billboards to coax passersby with the slogan: “Vittorio Angelone has
  always denied any involvement in the Edinburgh fringe.” Fashionable music
  marketing appears to be a growing influence on the fringe and the comedy
  industry in general. This is reflected in the rise of comedy nights such as
  Adam Flood’s Late Night Comedy Rave; Ivo Graham’s DJ sets featuring comedian
  guests; and Jack Shep’s London comedy night, Wanting to Be Cool, Having to Be
  Funny. (I am devastated to report that I have not performed at any of these.)
  But unlike musicians, comedians don’t seem to mind hiring the same designers
  and photographers as each other. “Which is good for me,” says Julings.
  “Unfortunately, I think it’s because of the financial margins and the money
  that’s being spent at the fringe and the gamble that’s being made.” Performers
  spend hundreds or thousands of pounds hiring photographers, designers and
  booking advertising space with Out of Hand, the festival’s main outdoor
  advertising provider. “Everybody’s looking at each other saying, I don’t want
  to be the one to do something wrong.” I can relate to this. I ask Jonny what
  he thinks of my poster this year, which was photographed by Rebecca
  Need-Menear and designed by my sister, Robyn Packham, who gave me a 15%
  discount. “I think it came out great!” he says. Phew. Maybe I am cool after
  all. • Alfie Packham: My Apologies to the Chef is at Underbelly, Bristo
