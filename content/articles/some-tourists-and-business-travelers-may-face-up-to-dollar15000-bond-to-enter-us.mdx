  The US state department has prepared plans to impose bonds as high as $15,000
  for some tourism and business visas, according to a draft of a temporary final
  rule. The bonds would be issued to visitors from countries with significant
  overstay rates, under a 12-month pilot program. It renews an initiative issued
  by the first Trump administration in November 2020, the month that Joe Biden
  defeated Donald Trump in the presidential election. That rule would have
  required a $15,000 bond for tourist and business travelers from two dozen
  countries with 10% or higher overstay rates, mostly in Africa. The new federal
  registry notice of the visa bond pilot program is scheduled to be published on
  5 August. “The Pilot Program will enable the Department to assess the
  operational feasibility of posting, processing, and discharging visa bonds, in
  coordination with the Department of the Treasury (‘Treasury’) and the
  Department of Homeland Security (‘DHS’), and to inform any future decision
  concerning the possible use of visa bonds to ensure nonimmigrants using these
  visa categories comply with the terms and conditions of their visas and timely
  depart the United States,” it states. It said it would announce the countries
  in question at the “Travel.State.Gov” website no fewer than 15 days before the
  pilot program takes effect. It also said the list might change, again with 15
  days notice. Tourists and business travelers would receive their bonds back
  when they depart the US, are naturalized as a citizen or die, according to the
  Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  regulations. The original six-month pilot program was never implemented. A
  state department spokesperson told Reuters that countries would be selected
  based on “high overstay rates, screening and vetting deficiencies, concerns
  regarding acquisition of citizenship by investment without a residency
  requirement, and foreign policy considerations”. The department did not
  provide an estimate on the number of applicants who could be affected. The
  Trump administration has cracked down on immigration to the US, including
  terminating temporary protected status for many people living in the US, and
  banning immigration visas outright for 12 countries. The bond policy could
  build on the president’s travel ban, which went into effect in June, mainly
  impacting countries in the the Middle East and Africa. Chad, Eritrea, Haiti,
  Myanmar and Yemen were targeted under the ban and also have high rates of visa
  overstays. Other countries with high overstay rates include Burundi, Djibouti
  and Togo, Reuters said, citing federal data from 2023. The US Travel
  Association, a group that represents major tourism firms, said in a statement
  that the scope of the visa bond pilot “appears to be limited”, affecting an
  estimated 2,000 applicants, likely from countries with low rates of travel to
  the US. The state department last month also unveiled new guidance directing
  US diplomats to review the online activity of foreign students before issuing
  educational and exchange visas. Students who refuse to unlock their social
  media profiles will be suspected of hiding the activity from US officials. The
  announcement of the new policy comes as data has shown the US is suffering a
  sharp decline in tourism, including an 11.6% decrease in overseas visitors in
  March, with the tourism industry expected to lose out on billions of dollars
  this year due to government actions. Travel from Canada and Mexico has fallen
  by 20% year over year, according to the US Travel Association. That group has
  also warned about the impact of requiring visitors to pay a $250 “visa
  integrity fee”, which was included in Trump’s sweeping tax bill last month.
  That fee, if adopted, would be one of the highest in the world for a country
  to charge. There have also been increasing accounts of tourists and visitors
  with valid visas getting detained by Ice, escalating fears that a trip to the
  US could carry serious risks. Reuters contributed reporting
