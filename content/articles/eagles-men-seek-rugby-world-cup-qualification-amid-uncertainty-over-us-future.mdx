  The US men’s rugby team plays Canada on Friday with World Cup qualification at
  stake – and with the American women’s own World Cup adventures in England,
  Ilona Maher and all, dominating global attention. Given the men’s failure to
  qualify for France 2023, and pressing need to secure a place at Australia 2027
  ahead of USA 2031, Scott Lawrence’s Eagles may be happy to fly under the
  radar. Certainly, Lawrence delivered a low-key statement ahead of kick-off in
  Calgary, the first of a Pacific Nations Cup (PNC) that also features Japan,
  Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. “We’re grateful to the tournament organizers providing
  this year’s competition in North America,” Lawrence said. “We are looking
  forward to seeing the growth within the team over the course of the tournament
  and performing well on home soil in September.” Japan join the US and Canada
  in one PNC group – the Eagles play the Brave Blossoms in Sacramento on 6
  September – while the Pacific islands form the other. Play-offs follow in
  Denver (14 September) and Salt Lake City (20 September). Fiji and Japan have
  already qualified for 2027. Of the other four teams, only the one that
  finishes lowest will not be assured of a place. If the higher-ranked Japan win
  both their pool games, the winner of USA v Canada will qualify. The loser will
  get a second chance via a fifth-place play-off, most likely against Tonga. The
  loser of that game will head into yet more play-offs, of the sort that
  produced an Eagles nightmare last time round, beaten by Chile, squeezed out by
  Portugal. Lawrence’s squad is 39-strong. The vast majority are employed at
  home in Major League Rugby – and thus subject to persistent uncertainty. Four
  Eagles who had a club when the team lost 40-5 to England in DC in July no
  longer do so, after the demise of NOLA Gold (scrum-half Ruben de Haas) and
  Miami Sharks (prop Alec McDonnell, lock Rick Rose, flanker and captain Benja
  Bonasso). Five more players are with Anthem Rugby Carolina, the World Rugby
  and USA Rugby-backed team formed to foster American talent but with a two-year
  MLR record of played 32, lost … 32. Canada have a better World Cup record than
  the US, having reached the quarter-finals in 1991, something the Eagles aspire
  to better under Lawrence’s Moonshot 2031 project. But Canada’s men also failed
  to qualify for France 2023, the same year their sole MLR team, Toronto Arrows,
  had to shut up shop. Canada’s coach, Stephen Meehan, said: “We’re building a
  solid foundation in our efforts to qualify for the Rugby World Cup. We’ve
  invited a mix of experienced players and new talent, and we’re excited to see
  what each of them brings.” Two French-based forwards, Evan Olmsted (Biarritz)
  and Tyler Ardron (Castres), offer much of that experience. Naming both to
  start, Meehan said: “The effort and understanding … shown in training has been
  very good. Competition for starting XV and reserves was high and this
  demonstrates the depth we’re building. It’s now time to execute what we’ve
  practiced.” Nonetheless, a US team led from fly-half by AJ MacGinty, of Sale
  in the English Premiership, and with the gigantic Tonga Kofe, a former D1
  football player now signed for Leicester, forbidding at tighthead prop, will
  start favourites for the win. Lawrence said: “Going into this assembly our
  priorities were to create the right environment for the players to express
  themselves. We’ve concentrated on being clear about the simple things and then
  let the players fill in the gaps, let them trust their skill sets.” All will
  do their best to push to the back of their minds the question of what US rugby
  might look like next year, or by kick-off in 2027. As MLR struggles, and as
  World Rugby looks to invest in the run-up to 2031, foreign interests circle.
  Super Rugby is reportedly eyeing the west coast and the United Rugby
  Championship the east, seeking to plant teams presumably heavily staffed with
  foreign players. There is also the lingering question of R360, the Mike
  Tindall-fronted breakaway league. This week, Nick Easter, the England No8
  turned US defense and forwards coach, told the World Rugby owned Rugby Pass
  site: “It’s good that the URC has shown interest in trying to get a couple of
  teams into that league. “For me, the best outcome for the URC would be the
  South African teams going back to join Super Rugby and create more of those
  fantastic games and not be a part of European rugby. “Then keep the URC as
  Europe and the US teams because you need to grow the sport in North America,
  and that funding and exposure are needed over here. “Of course, in terms of
  quality, the MLR is nowhere near the URC, and it may be that teams from the US
  would pull together their funds so they could get better players plus the top
  Eagles talent with the best coaches. “The possibility I have been hearing over
  the last couple of weeks is that Super Rugby wants the California Legion, as
  they are on the Pacific Coast, and Chicago Hounds, having been approached, and
  probably the Free Jacks for the URC.” The New England Free Jacks, based in
  Quincy, near Boston, have won three successive MLR titles. Where such moves
  would leave Old Glory DC, Houston SaberCats, Seattle Seawolves, Utah Warriors
  and Anthem RC remains, of course, to be seen. “What you have with those two
  Eastern teams is the Irish influence,” Easter continued, “and you will get
  Irish supporters flying into Chicago and Boston for matches, along with
  ex-pats putting bums on seats. From the California side of things, there is a
  big Pacific Islands community that could be attracted to matches.” Granted
  anonymity, one senior MLR stakeholder said he wished Easter would “focus on
  winning” the Canada game.
