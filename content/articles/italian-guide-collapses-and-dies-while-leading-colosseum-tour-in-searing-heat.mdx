  Tour guides in Rome have repeated their calls for a rethink of the summer
  opening hours of some of the city’s biggest attractions after one of their
  colleagues died of a suspected heart attack while showing a group around the
  Colosseum in baking heat. Giovanna Maria Giammarino, who was 56, collapsed in
  the amphitheatre at 6pm on Tuesday. Despite the efforts of tourists and the
  emergency services, she could not be revived and died at the scene. Her death
  came weeks after the World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations warned
  that “extreme heat is no longer an exception; it is a new reality that demands
  attention, adaptation, and solidarity within our profession”. As tributes and
  condolences poured in, Italy’s Certified Tour Guide Association (AGTA) said
  Giammarino’s death was proof of the physical toll that guiding takes on the
  body, and urged the authorities to extend the Colosseum’s opening hours so
  tours could take place in the cool of the early morning or later in the
  evening. The Colosseum is open from 8.30am until 7.15pm from the end of March
  to the end of September. “First of all, the opening hours of the
  Archaeological Park of the Colosseum [which includes the Colosseum, the Forum
  and the Palatine Hill] need to change during summer,” AGTA said in a statement
  posted on social media. “It’s useless to talk about a ‘heat emergency’ every
  year as if this were something new: climate change is a fact and for some
  years, working at the Roman Forum from 10:00 to 4:30pm has been unbearable.”
  The association said that from the beginning of June to “at least the end of
  August”, the opening hours of the Colosseum area should run from 7am to
  8.15pm. “For three years, we’ve been asking for the opening of the whole park
  to be brought forward to 7am and for closing to be postponed by an hour,” said
  AGTA. “These changes would benefit the public health of everyone: visitors,
  guides and other workers.” The association said that paltry pensions and
  economic uncertainty had forced many of its members to push themselves and
  work at an unsustainable pace in order to be able to support their families.
  “[On Tuesday] a guide left for ever, but in recent years too many have left
  this activity for other ‘safer’ and less demanding jobs,” the statement added.
  “We need more protection.” The Colosseum’s authorities offered their
  condolences to Giammarino’s family and said how much they had appreciated her
  “professional dedication”. Italy’s culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, said
  her death “powerfully underscores the human and professional value of those
  who, every day, contribute to the protection and preservation of our
  historical and artistic heritage”. In a gesture of respect and mourning, the
  Colosseum’s lights were turned off at 9pm on Wednesday. Last month, Italy’s
  national tour guide federation, Federagit, also requested that the opening of
  the Colosseum Archaeological Park be brought forward by an hour. Francesca
  Duimich, who represents 300 Roman tour guides, said dehydrated tourists often
  passed out in the summer heat of Rome. “The forum is a pit; there is no shade,
  there is no wind,” Duimich told the Associated Press. “Being there at 1pm or
  2pm in the summer heat means you will feel unwell.”
