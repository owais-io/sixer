  Beaches across the US are facing swimming caution advisories during the Labor
  Day holiday weekend due to water quality concerns caused by elevated levels of
  bacteria associated with fecal waste. Beaches from Crystal River, Florida, to
  Ogunquit, Maine, have been under advisories this week, discouraging beachgoers
  from entering the water because the bacteria can cause gastrointestinal
  illness, rashes and nausea. Closures at some of the most popular beach
  destinations in the US this week include Keyes Memorial Beach in the Cape Cod
  village of Hyannis in Barnstable, Massachusetts, Benjamin’s Beach on Long
  Island in Bay Shore, New York, and part of the Imperial Beach shoreline near
  San Diego. The Hawaii state department of health warned of a high bacteria
  count at Kahaluu Beach Park earlier this week. Beaches are typically packed
  with crowds on Labor Day weekend as Americans celebrate the end of summer. A
  report issued in July 2025 by Environment America found 61% of beaches tested
  in the US experienced at least one day where fecal contamination reached
  potentially unsafe levels. The report examined whether fecal bacteria levels
  exceeded standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), levels
  that can cause illness in 32 out of every 1,000 swimmers. The report stated
  453 beaches were potentially unsafe for swimming on at least 25% of days
  tested. “Enjoying the fresh sea breeze and splash of waves at the beach is a
  highlight of the summer for many Americans, but pollution still plagues too
  many of the places where we swim,” said John Rumpler, the clean water director
  for Environment America Research &amp; Policy Center and a co-author of the
  report, in a statement. “Now is not the time to slash the water infrastructure
  funding that communities sorely need to stop the flow of nasty bacteria and
  pollution to our beaches.” The report cited polluted runoff from roads,
  overflowing or failing sewer systems, and industrial livestock operations as
  common contaminant sources. The group recommended beachgoers avoid swimming 72
  hours after heavy storms, be cognizant of and research whether your beach has
  issues with contaminants, and avoid entering water that is discolored, cloudy
  or foul-smelling.
