  The upcoming launch of a new party by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana (Jeremy
  Corbyn and Zarah Sultana agree to launch leftwing party, 24 July) will
  inevitably prompt questions about whether this will divide the progressive
  vote or offer a genuine alternative to Labour’s centrist drift, especially as
  the Green party continues to grow as a principled voice for environmental and
  social justice. Although these projects are potential rivals, they need not
  be. If the disturbing rise of rightwing populism is to be successfully
  confronted, the left must overcome fragmentation and find ways to coexist and
  collaborate. The Corbyn-Sultana initiative and the Greens share much common
  ground: a rejection of austerity, commitment to democratic reform and a belief
  in economic and ecological justice. Their differences in emphasis, tone and
  priorities are real but not irreconcilable. There has to be scope for a
  non-aggression pact at the next general election, with each party standing
  aside in constituencies where the other has a better chance of success. Joint
  campaigning on core issues – such as proportional representation, protest
  rights, wealth taxes and a green new deal – could amplify their impact, and
  framing climate action as central to economic justice, not separate from it,
  could provide a unifying narrative for both. This is not about merging or
  blurring identities. It is about strategic and political maturity. If the left
  cannot cooperate when so much is at stake, it will surrender the field to
  those who thrive on division and fear. Unity does not require uniformity; it
  requires courage and purpose. The worse case, of a public war of words and
  clashing candidacies between the Greens and Corbynites, would demoralise
  voters and hand the initiative to the populist right. Patrick Cosgrove Chapel
  Lawn, Shropshire • Your report quotes Labour party sources who are dismissive
  of the threat from Jeremy Corbyn and then bluntly states that Corbyn “lost the
  2017 and 2019 elections as party leader”. It would have provided a fairer
  context if you had pointed out that in 2017, the Corbyn-led Labour party
  achieved 2.5m more votes (and a 6% higher vote share) than Keir Starmer did in
  2024. Even in 2019, 500,000 more people voted for Corbyn’s party than
  Starmer’s. Dr Chris Morris Kidderminster, Worcestershire • In the winter
  election of 2019 I spent hours leafleting for Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party.
  The sensation of cold and wet letterboxes still lingers on my fingertips when
  I think of what he said in an Observer article just after the election – that
  Labour had lost the election but won the argument. This is all Mr Corbyn is
  interested in doing – winning the argument – and indeed I think he will find
  that is all he ever will win. Ross Armstrong Chester • Thank you to Jeremy
  Corbyn for still caring enough and having the humanity to rally the 99% to
  join together and put 40 years of neoliberal theft and exploitation behind us.
  I support all his domestic policies, but the realpolitik of foreign policy
  bothers me. How would he deal with Vladimir Putin and Benjamin Netanyahu?
  Pamela Hope Kingston upon Thames, London • Oh, Jeremy Corbyn, why splinter the
  left further by creating a new party when the Greens already actively stand
  and work for all you want to fight for? Sushila Dhall Oxford • Have an opinion
  on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and
  it will be considered for publication in our letters section.
