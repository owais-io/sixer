  When asylum seekers first arrive at Manston, a former military base outside
  Ramsgate in Kent, they are ushered from one enormous, grubby marquee to the
  next for a series of interviews and checks. As many as 1,000 people a day are
  processed at the site after crossing the Channel in small boats, and
  interviews continue through the night. Upon arrival in the UK, exhausted and
  disorientated, their phones and other belongings are taken from them and
  placed in distinctive blue plastic bags. Signs flash up on TV screens in
  various languages. “You have entered the UK illegally from a safe country,
  France. As a result you will not be able to obtain citizenship. You will not
  be able to settle in the UK.” People are only supposed to stay at Manston for
  24 hours before being released to hotels, but some stay longer. In what is
  thought to be one of the largest class actions of its kind against the Home
  Office, at least 250 people who were detained at Manston in the second half of
  2022 are suing for unlawful detention and other breaches of their rights. The
  centre was dangerously overcrowded at the time – designed to hold a maximum of
  1,600 people, it was accommodating 4,000 – and grappling with outbreaks of
  infectious diseases including diphtheria and scabies. The Kurdish asylum
  seeker Hussein Haseeb Ahmed, who was processed at Manston, died in hospital
  after contracting diphtheria on 19 November 2022. The former independent chief
  inspector of borders and immigration, David Neal, has said the poorly managed
  and insanitary conditions there were so bad he was rendered speechless, and
  documents disclosed in a court action show Home Office officials admitting
  they had “completely lost our grip” on the situation. An independent inquiry
  is under way into events at Manston in the second half of 2022. Staff are
  clear that conditions have improved, but many who spoke to the Guardian still
  say the site is a wholly inadequate place to accommodate traumatised asylum
  seekers. ‘Sleeping while walking’ Increasingly dangerous journeys across the
  Channel mean more people are arriving in Manston in a bad condition. The
  number of people taken to A&amp;E from the site has increased almost sevenfold
  in the last three years from seven in 2022 to 46 in 2024, according to data
  obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from East Kent hospitals
  university NHS foundation trust. People are taken to A&amp;E with crush
  injuries from the dinghies, fractures and infectious diseases. According to
  one of the six current staff members at Manston who spoke to the Guardian,
  asylum seekers arrive not having slept or eaten for several days. “They are so
  tired they sleep like the dead,” they said. “They are constantly bleary-eyed.
  Some even seem to be sleeping while they’re walking.” Another said: “Sometimes
  they can be sitting on hard chairs from 2.30am until 9.30am with no access to
  fresh air. If they want to go to the toilet they have to put their hand up to
  ask. English people would go berserk if they were treated like that. “Some
  have fuel burns, crush injuries or hypothermia from their journeys. Many,
  including the children, are scratching themselves raw from having the salty
  sea water on their bodies.” A third said: “One young man from Afghanistan who
  arrived at Manston on a small boat said to me: ‘If you paid me a million
  pounds I would never go on that sea again. Every minute of my journey on the
  dinghy I thought I was going to die.’” War films shown on TV The staff members
  said some of their colleagues had little concern for the asylum seekers who
  find themselves there. One was suspended after waking someone up with their
  foot. Another was sacked after pulling a sleeping child to its feet and making
  disparaging comments about him. Twenty-nine staff were sacked after failing
  drug tests in 2024, a sixfold increase in the space of a year. An
  investigation was launched earlier this year after a racist message – “fuck
  off you [N-word]s, go back to where you came from” – was reportedly “blasted
  out” on portable radios used by Home Office contractors. The ministry and its
  contractor, Mitie, condemned the language used. One staff member said their
  colleagues sometimes played war films on the TVs at the centre. “Surely these
  war films should not be shown when people who have fled war are sitting in the
  marquees,” they said. Home Office sources said contractors watching
  inappropriate content on site would be subject to a disciplinary process.
  Staff also said a common response from hostile colleagues to new arrivals’
  requests for pain medication or permission to sleep was: “Well if you don’t
  like it here you shouldn’t have got on the boat.” When staff were escorting
  asylum seekers who had just disembarked from the air-conditioned coach that
  had brought them to Manston, one remarked: “These coaches are far too good for
  them.” ‘Try walking a mile in their shoes’ One staff member said it was a
  shame so many of their colleagues did not take the time to listen to the
  asylum seekers’ stories. “One boy from Vietnam told me he was escaping from
  someone who wanted to remove his organs to sell them,” they said. “A
  74-year-old Afghan woman told me she made the journey here alone.” Another
  said: “We see a lot of negative things in the media about people who come to
  the UK being dangerous terrorists or people who just want to come and work
  here illegally. I have found people to be grateful and polite. “They are not
  swearing, they are not aggressive. These people are so exhausted and so
  traumatised yet somehow they keep themselves so calm. I think they’re the most
  controlled people I’ve ever met.” A third said: “All they want is a role and a
  purpose in life like everybody else. They are very resilient people. I say to
  some of my colleagues who criticise them: ‘Try walking a mile in their
  shoes.’”
