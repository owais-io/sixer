  Betty Grumble’s Enemies of Grooviness Eat Sh!t review – nude, lewd and
  confused
sectionName: Stage

bodyText: >-
  This experimental act from Australia knows how to create merry anarchy with
  incantatory rituals and boundary-free explicitness. Performance artist Emma
  Maye Gibson, otherwise known as Betty Grumble, warns us about the nudity but
  this might not prepare some for what comes. A gigantic “pussy print” hangs
  behind her on the wall and at one madcap moment she begins making imprint
  smudges of her own vagina on paper to hand out. A (hopefully fake) turd on a
  plate is eaten with knife and fork. There is a frenzy of naked skids across
  the floor and a performance of masturbation that feels oddly earnest. None of
  it is especially shocking or dangerous, perhaps because it comes in the spirit
  of fun, and accompanied by synth pop beats from “hot assistant” Craig Slist
  (Megana Holiday). Gibson has abundant warmth and easiness but the show is slow
  to get going in terms of pace and focus. Her alter ego remains an assemblage
  of outre wig and mask, rather than a fully assumed identity, so feels slightly
  redundant. The central problem, though, is the lack of story and context.
  Gibson introduces the show by speaking of her grief for the
  Palestinian-Lebanese poet and activist Candy Royalle, who died in 2018. She
  also mentions her experience of domestic violence. The riotous lewdness that
  follows seems like a ritualistic assertion of joy in the face of those things.
  Yet the grief and abuse stay unknown. There is one very potent scene using
  music and repeated phrases to summon the dark spirit of a courtroom. It
  carries great dramatic intensity and you wish for more of this. Even if the
  show is fragmentary, non-narrative and experimental, it seems too unpinned and
  lands as an explicit variety act, which may be the desired effect for an
  artist who defines herself as a sex clown. Serotonin is briefly mentioned; so
  are revenge and justice. There are bird sounds and disco beats. It all feels
  random, helter-skelter. But it also embodies the bare-bodied life, soul and
  spirit of a bacchanal, albeit a strangely safe one. • At Assembly Roxy,
  Edinburgh, until 24 August • All our Edinburgh festival reviews
