  the election’

  India Walton has a warning message for progressive Democrats during Donald
  Trump’s second presidency: don’t water down your politics to win over the
  establishment. The Democratic socialist who stunned the Democratic party by
  defeating a four-term incumbent mayor in the Buffalo, New York, primary in
  2021 believes moderating her leftwing message cost her the general election.
  It’s a lesson that carries new weight now that Zohran Mamdani secured his own
  victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary earlier in the summer
  and inspired thousands of other progressive candidates to also run for office.
  After disrupting the political base in the US by beating sitting mayor Byron
  Brown in Buffalo’s Democratic primary, she says she pivoted toward the center
  – and lost. “Moderating is what got us here,” said Walton, now a senior
  strategist at RootsAction, referring to Donald Trump’s return to the White
  House. “I believe that moderating is what lost me ultimately the election in
  2021. “I pivoted fairly quickly … to try and integrate myself into the party,
  because I thought that was the way to build a broad-based coalition,” she
  reflected. “It sort of ate away from our message from the inside out.” After
  initially opposing charter schools in the primary to win the Buffalo Teachers
  Federation endorsement, Walton later told business leaders she supported
  “school choice” – and lost the union’s backing for the general election as a
  result. She also distanced herself from the “defund the police” movement.
  Shortly after Walton won the primary that year, the establishment and
  investor-aligned Brown mounted an unorthodox write-in campaign and won, even
  though his race was marked by possible campaign finance violations including
  receiving contributions from real estate corporations in defiance of election
  law.. Brown, an ally of the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and a former
  New York Democratic party chair, would step down in 2024 to serve as president
  and CEO of a western New York off-track betting company. But in 2021, there
  was widespread fear over Walton’s socialist tendencies, with the city even
  researching whether or not it should entirely abandon its mayoral system over
  her primary win. These days, Walton argues Democrats lost working-class voters
  by abandoning populist economics. “I think a part of the reason how we got a
  second Donald Trump presidency is that the Democrats have not had a message
  that appeals to working-class and poor people.” The establishment resists such
  policies because they are “beholden to corporations and billionaires”, she
  added. “It’s not the message they want to hear, but it is the message that is
  resonant with the voters.” Walton’s analysis runs counter to some Democratic
  strategists who argue the party moved too far left after 2024’s losses. One
  postmortem survey by the Progressive Policy Institute showed 68% of
  working-class voters believed the Democratic party had embraced overly
  progressive positions. Soon after Trump’s election win and swing state sweep,
  the New York Times columnist Ezra Klein argued that the Biden-era Democratic
  party reflected “a culture in which nobody is saying no to the groups at any
  level of American Democratic politics”. Yet last year, progressive ballot
  measures thrived even as Democratic candidates struggled. Voters across the
  country approved minimum wage increases, paid leave expansions, and other
  progressive economic policies, with red states embracing progressive measures
  even while supporting Trump, like Missouri where voters passed a $15 minimum
  wage and paid sick leave, or Nebraska where voters approved guaranteed paid
  time off. A July 2025 poll by the Democratic pollster Celinda Lake for
  progressive network Way to Win found that Democratic voters who skipped 2024
  want candidates more like the independent Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and
  New York member of congress Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, suggesting the party’s
  problem may be insufficient progressivism rather than too much. One example
  Walton pointed to was the debate on “defund the police” that did damage to
  many progressive and centrist campaigns. The real message, which Walton said
  had been distorted, was about shifting police funding toward social services
  and mental health care. The slogan ultimately became a political liability. In
  2020, centrist Democrats warned it had cost them over a dozen swing district
  House seats after Joe Biden’s presidential win and in Minneapolis, voters
  rejected a measure to overhaul policing even after George Floyd’s murder. In a
  pre-Mamdani New York City, Eric Adams ran explicitly against “defund the
  police” and won. Now Mamdani – a democratic socialist assemblyman who defeated
  Cuomo with 56% in the final ranked-choice count – has given progressives fresh
  momentum all over again. His victory generated immediate enthusiasm, with Run
  for Something, a progressive group that urges young candidates to seek public
  office, noting that 10,000 people nationwide signed up to pursue public office
  within two weeks of his win. Walton sees opportunity in younger voters who
  don’t follow traditional political voting patterns. “Millennials are the first
  generation who are not becoming more conservative as they age.” Her advice to
  progressive candidates is simple: resist the pressure to compromise. “People
  hear hope in ‘we’re going to prioritize working-class people’,” she said.
  “People hear hope in ‘I’m not going to capitulate to the establishment and
  negotiate all of our power that we’ve built’. This is the right time.”
