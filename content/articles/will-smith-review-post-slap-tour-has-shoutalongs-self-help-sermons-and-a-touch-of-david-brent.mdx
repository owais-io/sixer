  touch of David Brent

  Around halfway through Will Smith’s set the video screens are taken over by a
  mock streaming service called Willflix. The cursor cycles through box office
  smash after box office smash before teeing up a shoutalong to Inner Circle’s
  Bad Boys, drawing attention to his outsized cultural footprint while also
  framing the night as a whole: a disorienting splurge of nostalgia, high energy
  set pieces and self-help sermons, channelling the tonal whiplash of watching
  the first five minutes of 10 films before calling it and going to bed. Smith
  launches into Gettin’ Jiggy Wit It, the crowd leaping and yelling each lyric
  as he falls into formation with six dancers dressed in outsized sports
  jerseys, mimicking his own Phillies cap and red starter jacket. He wore a
  similar get-up on the cover of his recent album Based on a True Story, a
  critical and commercial turkey that documented his journey into shame and
  acceptance post-Oscars slap, and there’s friction between its stomping
  rap-rock soul-searching and Smith’s undimmed need for everyone to have a good
  time when he’s around. His new material fares better live than it does on
  record, with a rowdy Bulletproof gilded by a shreddy guitar solo and You Can
  Make It cleverly turned outwards to become an audience-wide pep talk. There is
  a remarkable sequence during the intro to Work of Art where Smith pulls the
  statuette he won that night from a bag as he reels off the track’s opening
  lines a cappella. It’s wild – a moment of piercing vulnerability that also
  recalls David Brent going home to get his guitar. The other side of the coin
  is that, given a stage and a microphone, Smith remains a peerless, goofily
  endearing show off. He pogos, hollers and gives the people what they want,
  filling the stage with dozens of “agents” during Men in Black and
  interpolating the theme from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air into Switch. Fuelled
  by after school repeats of his star-making sitcom, the audience’s response is
  a raucous shot of goodwill that keeps Smith’s head above the water line when
  things get choppy. • Will Smith plays O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, on 27
  August, O2 Brixton Academy, London, on 28 August and University of
  Wolverhampton at the Halls on 30 August
