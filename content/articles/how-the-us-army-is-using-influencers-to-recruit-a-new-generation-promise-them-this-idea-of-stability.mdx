  Fitness influencer Steven Kelly posted a carousel of photos on Instagram last
  month that included shots of himself dressed in military fatigues climbing a
  rope wall and aiming a firearm. Kelly, who has 1.3 million followers on the
  platform, isn’t enlisted in any military branch – instead it was a sponsored
  post created in partnership with the US army. “This experience showed me how
  the Army builds readiness, resilience, and discipline,” the caption said, as
  Kelly described the experience of taking part in basic training exercises. The
  post pointed followers to a link in his bio to learn more about the US army’s
  opportunities. Kelly is just one of a number of influencers who are creating
  sponsored content as part of a new initiative by the US army to reach
  potential gen – Z recruits who may not have ever had exposure to military
  life. Many of the partnerships are with lifestyle content creators – other
  examples include a chef, an extreme sports enthusiast and travel influencers.
  “These partnerships increase the army’s visibility, bring awareness to
  untapped audiences, and articulate the possibilities of army service in unique
  and creative ways,” said Madison Bonzo, a US army recruiting spokesperson. The
  strategy reveals how integral influencers have become to selling not just
  products but also jobs and entire lifestyles – enlisting is a multi-year
  commitment. The recruitment effort is also unfolding alongside the US’s
  ongoing military aid to Israel as part of a war that is growing more and more
  unpopular. A recent Gallup poll found that less than a third of adults in the
  US back Israel’s military action in Gaza as a flood of news reports have
  exposed the ongoing starvation crisis killing people as a result of Israel
  blocking aid. Some commenters called Kelly’s post “propaganda” and found the
  posts distasteful. “The rich influencing the poor to do the things that they
  dont want to. Its giving Hunger Games. Its giving Class Wars,” wrote one
  person. Robert Kozinets, a professor at the University of Southern California
  who has written extensively about social media and marketing, said the content
  wasn’t so dissimilar to other types of advertising campaigns. “We’re pretty
  used to celebrities or personalities who are endorsing particular products,”
  even if they don’t use them themselves, said Kozinets, adding: “You don’t have
  to live at Disneyland to do a review of Disneyland.” While the recruitment
  effort is new, military influencers who post about life in the armed forces
  are not. Some creators such as @onexpunchxdad on TikTok poke fun at military
  life and highlight some of the realities. A recent post, for example, explains
  three things video games get wrong about the military (one is that it actually
  hurts if you get shot). And next month, a Military Influencer conference in
  Atlanta includes sessions about how content creators navigate both active duty
  and their personal lives and as well as elevating military voices on TikTok.
  The recent slate of sponsored posts, though, are slicker, and selling
  something more exciting than the reality. In another example, Breannah Yeh, an
  extreme sports influencer known for her slacklining videos, posted about the
  experience of tandem skydiving with the army. “Challenges are what let us
  grow,” says an army captain in the video before Yeh jumps out of the plane.
  “That was so epic. I do feel pretty incredible,” Yeh says after landing on the
  beach thanks to an army-branded parachute. The video ends with the familiar
  slogan: “Be all you can be.” The US army’s hope is that the content is
  enticing enough to attract more people to enlist. “By participating in
  immersive army experiences alongside real soldiers, these influencers provide
  firsthand insights into military life and the possibilities of army service,”
  Bonzo said. The move follows the trend of several branches of the military
  having trouble meeting their enlistment goals in recent years, said Katherine
  Kuzminski, the director of studies at Center for a New American Security who
  researches military recruitment and retention. With more young people at home
  finishing school remotely because of the pandemic, they had less opportunity
  for exposure to programs such as the ROTC, she said. “Accessing this entire
  generation of young adults who were in transition became challenging,” said
  Kuzminski. But the numbers are rebounding and recruitment is up again. Just
  before Memorial Day, Donald Trump said while traveling in Riyadh that military
  recruitment was rebounding more than ever under his administration. “After
  years of military recruiting shortfalls, enlistments in the US armed forces
  are now the highest in 30 years because there is such an incredible spirit in
  the United States of America,” he said. The pattern began before Trump took
  office, data shows. Between 2020 and 2023, the army missed its annual
  recruitment goals. Last year, recruitment improved and it met its target. In
  June, the army announced it met its goals of enlisting 61,000 new recruits –
  four months earlier than expected. Jess Rauchberg, an assistant professor at
  Seton Hall University who studies the cultural impact of social media,
  reviewed some of the posts on behalf of the Guardian and said the content also
  has a message of security in an unstable time. “The military is capitalizing
  on this moment to say, ‘Well, our numbers are down and gen Z is hurting for
  jobs and stable lives,’” said Rauchberg, Working with creators is a way to
  “promise them this idea of stability – if you work for us, we will take care
  of you”. “That’s appealing to a lot of young people,” she added.
