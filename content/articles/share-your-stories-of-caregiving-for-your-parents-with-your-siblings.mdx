  In 1981, social worker Dorothy A Miller coined the term “sandwich generation”
  to describe “adult children of the elderly who are ‘sandwiched’ between their
  ageing parents and their own maturing children”. This combination leads to “a
  great deal of stress,” Miller wrote. The concept has since expanded into the
  “club sandwich generation” – adults in their 40s to 60s who, as a result of
  longer lifespans, find themselves caring for their children, parents and
  grandparents. Many people end up navigating this period alongside their
  siblings, and the division of labor is not always clear. Which sibling should
  take on more responsibility for their parents and (possibly) grandparents:
  whichever one lives the closest? Whichever makes the most money? And what
  happens when siblings disagree on how best to care for their ailing relatives?
  We want to hear your experiences of caregiving with siblings: how did you
  decide who did what? How did you navigate conflicting ideas and preferences?
  And how has it affected your relationship as siblings? If you’re having
