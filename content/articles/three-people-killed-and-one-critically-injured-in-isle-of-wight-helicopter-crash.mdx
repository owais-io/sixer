  Three people have been killed after a helicopter crashed on the Isle of Wight
  during a flying lesson. The helicopter carrying four people crashed into a
  field near Shanklin at about 9.20am on Monday. One person onboard was
  airlifted to hospital and remains in a serious condition. Hampshire and Isle
  of Wight police confirmed that three people had been killed in the crash. In a
  statement, the force said: “At this time we are unable to provide further
  information about the people involved, as efforts continue to contact and
  support their families. “We will not be commenting on the circumstances of the
  incident but continue to work alongside the Air Accident Investigation
  Branch.” The AAIB said it had launched an investigation into the incident,
  adding: “A team of inspectors has been sent to the accident site to gather
  evidence and make inquiries.” Northumbria Helicopters, the operator of the
  aircraft, confirmed that four people were on aircraft G-OCLV involved in the
  crash. It said: “The flight, which departed from Sandown airport at
  approximately 9am was carrying four passengers on board including the pilot,
  and was undertaking a flying lesson. “Northumbria Helicopters is giving its
  full cooperation to the authorities investigating this incident. A
  spokesperson for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance said: “We have
  treated and airlifted one patient to the Major Trauma Centre, University
  hospital Southampton. Our thoughts are with them, and everyone involved in
  today’s incident.” One witness, Leigh Goldsmith, said she saw the helicopter
  “spiralling”. Speaking to the Isle of Wight County Press, she said she was
  driving towards Shanklin when the helicopter disappeared and came down in a
  hedge. Afterwards, she said she went to the scene of the crash and saw what
  looked like airbags activated under the helicopter. Speaking to BBC Radio 5
  Live, Joe Robertson, MP for the Isle of Wight East, told people to avoid the
  area. “Where the helicopter came down is fairly rural,” he said. “It’s
  surrounded by fields and a road that runs from Shanklin and Sandown, which are
  on the east, quite well-known for their beaches, through to Ventnor in the
  south, which is part of the rocky part of south of the island. “It is not in a
  very populated area, albeit it seems to be fairly close to a road that runs
  between two towns.”
