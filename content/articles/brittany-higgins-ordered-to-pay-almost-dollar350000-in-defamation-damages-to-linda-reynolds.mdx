  Linda Reynolds has won her defamation case against Brittany Higgins in the
  Western Australian supreme court, marking the end of a protracted legal battle
  with her former staffer. The state supreme court judge Paul Tottle ruled on
  Wednesday that the former defence minister’s reputation was damaged by a 2022
  social media post from David Sharaz, which Higgins responded to, and an
  Instagram story published by Higgins in July 2023. Tottle found Higgins had
  defamed Reynolds in an Instagram story on 4 July 2023, which shared a
  screenshot of headlines publicising Reynolds’ intentions to refer Higgins’
  $2.445m personal injury settlement to the federal anti-corruption body and
  accused her of mishandling her alleged rape and waging a campaign of
  harassment. However, Tottle found Higgins had successfully defended against
  Reynolds’ defamation allegations in another post accusing the former senator
  of “silencing” sexual assault victim-survivors. Tottle said Higgins’ legal
  team had successfully established the defence of honest opinion, fair comment
  and qualified privilege. Reynolds failed to prove Higgins and Sharaz had
  concocted a conspiracy to publicly release the details of Higgins’s alleged
  rape with the “sole or predominant purpose” of destroying the former senator’s
  reputation, Tottle ruled. Sign up: AU Breaking News email The court also found
  Higgins had breached a deed of settlement she and Reynolds had reached in a
  March 2021 settlement after Reynolds was reported to have called her a “lying
  cow”. Tottle said Reynolds was entitled to relief as Higgins had broken the
  agreement not to make “adverse, critical or disparaging comments”. Higgins was
  ordered to pay Reynolds $315,000 in damages with an additional $26,109.25 in
  interest. She will also need to pay for Reynolds’s court and legal fees, an
  amount which will be determined at a later date. Outside the court, Reynolds
  said the ruling had “definitively established the truth” and had “finally and
  fully vindicated” her reputation. She described the allegations made against
  her as a “‘me too’ political hit job”. “This lie was so shocking, it was so
  despicable and so devastating, that I had no choice but to stand up tall and
  keep fighting no matter how many times I was knocked down. This lie devastated
  me. It devastated my staff, it devastated my family and so many friends,” she
  said. Higgins said she was “grateful” the matter had finally concluded. “I was
  24 years old when I was sexually assaulted in Parliament House. Six years have
  passed – years marked by challenge, scrutiny, and change,” she said in a
  statement distributed by her lawyer. “I accept that Linda Reynolds feelings
  were hurt by these events and I am sorry for that. I wish her well for the
  future. Thank-you to the Australian public for their compassion and
  understanding throughout this journey. My family and I now look forward to
  healing and rebuilding our lives.” Reynolds’ legal team argued during the
  trial that the senior Liberal senator had been cast as a “villain” in Higgins’
  fairytale after her staffer alleged in February 2021 that she had been
  sexually assaulted by a colleague in Reynolds’ ministerial office in March
  2019 and then had been left unsupported by her boss. Higgins told news.com.au
  and The Project that her alleged sexual assault had become a political
  “problem” for Reynolds and the wider Morrison government in the lead-up to the
  2019 federal election. The junior Liberal staffer alleged she had been made to
  choose between her future, either by working on the looming federal election
  in Perth for Reynolds, or by pausing her career aspirations to work remotely
  from the Gold Coast, where her support network was. During the trial in August
  and September, the court heard that Higgins had gone to the media to effect
  change in Parliament House after her alleged rape. Higgins’ lawyer, Rachael
  Young SC, said Higgins had felt professionally and personally isolated, and
  believed she had to stay quiet because her allegation was politically
  inconvenient. Reynolds’ lawyer, Martin Bennett, disputed the claim, saying
  Higgins “wouldn’t have a bar” of any offers of support. This was shown, he
  said, by her rejection of 20 attempts to offer phone counselling support in
  the months after her alleged rape. The senator’s case centred around social
  media posts published in July 2023 and a comment Higgins left on Sharaz’s post
  in January 2022 that she claimed damaged her reputation. Higgins posted a
  screenshot of headlines in July 2023 to her Instagram story publicising
  Reynolds’ intentions to refer Higgins’ $2.445m personal injury settlement to
  the federal anti-corruption body. “These are just headlines from today,” she
  wrote on the post. “This is from a current Australian senator who continues to
  harass me through the media and in the parliament. My former boss who has
  publicly apologised for mishandling my rape allegation. Who has had to
  publicly apologise to me after defaming me in the workplace … This has been
  going on for years now. It is time to stop.” Bennett said Higgins’ actions
  after going public with her allegations in 2021 had been driven by a “visceral
  hatred” of Reynolds and she had conspired with her now husband, David Sharaz,
  to harm the senator’s reputation and bring down the Morrison government. He
  told the court Higgins and Sharaz had felt “untouchable” and that Higgins
  believed “no one would sue a rape victim” so she could “say whatever [she]
  like[s]”. During his closing remarks, Bennett said the senator should receive
  a “substantial” payout if the verdict landed in his client’s favour and a
  permanent injunction should be placed on Higgins to prevent her from making
  further disparaging remarks. Bennett asked the judge to consider political
  defamation payouts where the damages awarded had exceeded more than half a
  million dollars. The verdict comes more than a year after a federal court
  judge ruled against Bruce Lehrmann in his defamation case against Network Ten
  and Lisa Wilkinson for airing Higgins’ sexual assault allegations against him.
  Lehrmann denied the rape allegations and pleaded not guilty at his criminal
  trial in the Australian Capital Territory supreme court, which was aborted.
  Prosecutors did not seek a retrial due to concerns about Higgins’ mental
  health. Justice Michael Lee found that Lehrmann had raped Higgins, on the
  balance of probabilities, on the minister’s couch in Parliament House in 2019.
  Lehrmann is appealing against the verdict. • This article was amended on 27
  August 2025 to clarify that the social media posts that defamed Linda Reynolds
  were published in 2022 and 2023. Initially the article stated the posts were
  published in 2023.
