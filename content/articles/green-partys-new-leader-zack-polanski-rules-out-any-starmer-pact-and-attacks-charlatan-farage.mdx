  Zack Polanski has won the election to lead the Green party in England and
  Wales, with an overwhelming mandate for the party to adopt his vision to
  become a mass membership “eco-populism” movement directly taking on Reform UK.
  Polanski, who was the party’s deputy leader and is a Green member of the
  London assembly, defeated Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns by 20,411 to 3,705
  votes in a ballot of party members. Ramsay and Chowns, who were standing as a
  co-leadership team, are two of the Greens’ four MPs. Polanski took nearly 85%
  of the votes on a turnout of just over 37%, notably higher than the 22% seen
  when the post was last contested in 2021. Speaking to a cheering crowd in
  London, the new leader promised to take on Reform and Labour, saying the
  Greens’ moment had come. “This is the Green party’s time. People in this
  country are exhausted. They are tired, they are sick of working long hours,
  and never feeling secure,” he said. “We know this political space has been
  ripe for charlatans like Nigel Farage and Reform millionaires who are
  pretending to serve working-class communities but are actually backed by the
  same billionaires who are destroying our democracies, our communities and our
  planet. So it is an absolute moral responsibility in this moment for the Green
  party to step up with the bold politics.” On Starmer, he said: “My message to
  Labour is very clear: we are not here to be disappointed by you. We are not
  here to be concerned by you. We are here to replace you.” Saying he wanted the
  Greens to aim for more than 30 seats at the next election, Polanski said he
  would not prop up a new Starmer government, adding: “I cannot imagine any
  scenario in which I would want to work with Keir Starmer.” While a Polanski
  win had been increasingly expected by party insiders, the result – with Ramsay
  and Chowns winning only 5% of the possible votes from an electorate of just
  over 64,500 – was particularly emphatic. It heralds what could be a markedly
  new chapter for the party, abandoning its longstanding focus on building up
  councillor and MP numbers in favour of a more radical, media-focused approach.
  While Polanski has said he will still concentrate on electoral gains, his hope
  is to accelerate Green advances by adopting a more visible and sometimes
  combative tone in media appearances, with the hope of mimicking Reform’s rapid
  advances under Nigel Farage. Answering media questions after his victory
  speech, Polanski said the success of Farage in getting his message across to
  voters was “throwing down the gauntlet” to other parties: “It’s time to be
  really ambitious, and to be visionary … Let’s raise our communications game.
  Let’s raise the boldness of our messaging.” Ramsay and Chowns previously said
  while they acknowledged Polanski’s communication skills – he is a former actor
  – they were concerned his more overtly leftwing approach could put off
  moderate voters, especially in the sort of rural seats they represent in
  parliament. Asked whether he would cooperate with the new leftwing party being
  launched by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, Polanski said it was too early to
  talk about alliances, and also a matter for the wider party. It was better, he
  said, to think of “intellectual coalitions”. He said he had talked to Corbyn
  about an inquiry into the situation in Gaza proposed by the former Labour
  leader: “We don’t need to be in the same party for me to support that. We
  don’t even need to be ‘allies’ for me to support that. What I see is a
  politician who is doing strong, principled work that aligns with the things I
  care about and the party cares about, and I think that’s different.” Corbyn
  congratulated Polanski in a post on X, saying: “I look forward to working with
  you to create a fairer, kinder world.” Ellie Reeves, the Labour chair, also
  congratulated him but said the new Green leader “must level with the British
  people” about whether he backed continued Nato membership, after he said
  during the campaign that Donald Trump’s approach made this unfeasible. After a
  sometimes bruising campaign, Polanski paid tribute to all the party’s MPs,
  particularly Ramsay, who was first elected as a councillor two decades ago. He
  ended his speech with an appeal for voters enthused by his message to sign up:
  “If you’re feeling hopeless, if you’re feeling in despair, if you’re feeling
  politically homeless, there is a political home for you. “I promise you
  nothing will make you feel more inspired, more ready to get out there, and
  more like we can turn our country around than joining the Green party. So join
  the Green party today.”
