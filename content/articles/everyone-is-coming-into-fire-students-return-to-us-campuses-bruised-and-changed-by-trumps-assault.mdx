  Students and faculty heading back to US colleges and universities from summer
  break are returning to bruised institutions reeling from the Trump
  administration’s unprecedented campaign to bend higher education to its
  ideological will, and are bracing for more uncertainty ahead. At the
  University of Utah, the Black student union has lost its funding and campus
  space – one of many student groups to face the brunt of Donald Trump’s
  anti-diversity measures. Indiana’s public universities have cut or merged more
  than 400 degree programs, about one-fifth of their academic offerings, while
  scores of other universities have made similar cuts as their budgets are on
  the line. At Harvard and Columbia, certain forms of criticism of Israel will
  now be punishable as antisemitism. And across the country, schools will see
  their international student population plummet after the administration
  erected a host of new barriers to students seeking to travel to the US. The
  threat to higher education feels “existential”, said Benjamin Kersten, an art
  history doctoral student at the University of California, Los Angeles, one of
  the universities targeted by the president with millions of dollars in cuts.
  “It makes me wonder how I’m supposed to compartmentalize and conduct the
  research I was brought here to do.” Kersten cited nationwide cuts and
  closures, dwindling research resources, crackdowns on student organizations,
  rising tuition, and worsening labor conditions for faculty. As a Jewish
  student involved in pro-Palestinian activism, he decried the administration
  attacking universities under the pretext of fighting antisemitism.
  “Threatening to cut off research funds and make the university pay the
  administration does nothing to make the campus safer for Jews,” he said. The
  impact, he added, was being felt “by everyone, from the most vulnerable
  students and employees to even tenured faculty”. Todd Wolfson, the president
  of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), agrees. “This is
  obviously the most intense assault on higher education by the federal
  government in the history of the United States,” he said. “Everyone is coming
  into fire.” Last fall, students returned to campuses to find newly fenced
  lawns and a string of restrictive measures passed by universities in response
  to the pro-Palestinian encampments that rocked the nation the previous spring.
  This year, they are returning to schools where scarcer protests have been
  punished with expulsions, where foreign students have been snatched off the
  street by masked federal agents, and where school administrators have been
  blackmailed by the government to conform to its pro-Israel, anti-diversity
  agenda or face billions in cuts. The new academic year promises further
  crackdowns and the reality settling throughout US academia that the turmoil of
  the last months will have a lasting effect. Already, three leading
  universities – Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania – have
  entered into settlements with the Trump administration, agreeing to millions
  in payouts and surrendering significant autonomy in an effort to save their
  federal funding. Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, boasted following
  the government’s much-watched settlement with Columbia that the deal would
  “change the course of campus culture for years to come”. Harvard is the only
  university to have sued the administration – over both funding cuts and an
  effort to block the school from enrolling foreign students. While it has
  scored some early wins in court, it is also reportedly close to making a deal
  with the White House. Trump has also recently frozen $584m in funding to UCLA,
  demanding the university pay $1bn to settle antisemitism claims. (A federal
  judge has ordered part of the funding restored). Dozens of other universities
  are facing civil rights investigations over alleged antisemitism, and
  education advocates expect the number of universities forced into settlements
  – which they say amount to “extortion” – will grow. A chilling effect Trump
  has described higher education as the enemy, and the assault of recent months
  fulfills a conservative agenda years in the making. The administration seized
  on campus divisions over Israel to impose a definition of antisemitism that
  critics caution is antithetical to academic inquiry, and freeze billions in
  grants and contracts – mostly for medical and scientific research. It forced
  out a university president and backed Republican governors’ efforts to stack
  the leadership of public universities with conservative ideologues. And the
  president has signed a flurry of executive orders wielding his axe at
  everything from equity initiatives to long-established accreditation systems.
  On Monday, the White House announced that it had revoked 6,000 international
  students’ visas since Trump took office and that immigration officials will
  begin to screen applicants’ social media posts for “anti-American activity”. A
  recent analysis by Nafsa, a non-profit association of international educators,
  projected that US universities could see a 30% to 40% decline in new
  international enrollment this upcoming academic year. On campuses, the impact
  has been immediate. “There is already a chilling effect, fueled by fear and
  intimidation, that stifles the free exchange of ideas, weakens innovation and
  curtails global influence,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American
  Association of Colleges and Universities. In July, as part of a legal
  challenge to the administration’s detention of international students and
  scholars over pro-Palestinian views, professors from universities across the
  country testified about having canceled travel plans, declined to write op-eds
  or participate in protests, and abandoned research projects out of fear of
  being targeted by the administration. “Following the arrest and the detention
  and the threat of deportation of several students … I felt that it was too
  risky for me to do research in the Middle East,” Nadje Al-Ali, a German
  anthropologist and former director of the Center for Middle East Studies at
  Brown University, said in court. “Although these were students, I felt like,
  OK, next in line will be faculty.” Some universities, perhaps anticipating the
  government’s demands, have preemptively gutted diversity initiatives, shut
  down programs and scholarship related to Palestine, and pursued disciplinary
  measures against faculty and students who are vocal about Palestinian rights.
  Scholars have canceled courses, quit their jobs or left the country rather
  than submit to what they say amounts to a censorship regime. Others are
  girding for the academic year ahead with a mix of dread and demoralization.
  “There’s a lot of hopelessness and devastation – no one I know is feeling
  secure in terms of affording rent and groceries, or whether they will be
  expelled or fired,” said Maura Finkelstein, an anthropologist who last year
  became the first tenured professor to be fired over her pro-Palestinian
  advocacy since the war in Gaza started. “There’s real, material fear.”
  Finkelstein, who spent the last year touring US campuses to talk about the
  crackdown on academic freedom on the pretense of fighting antisemitism, noted
  that many of her colleagues were just trying “to keep their head down and
  white-knuckle their way through”, even as others were deciding the ethical
  compromise was not worth it. “The point of a liberal arts education is to
  teach critical thinking skills, and now we’re seeing institutional procedures
  and policies that are making it so that critical thinking is no longer
  welcomed on campuses,” she said. The effect has tricked down to the states. In
  Texas, Ohio and Florida, Republican legislators were already leading the
  crusade against universities that the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, accused
  of “woke indoctrination”. But since Trump returned to office, they have seized
  on the momentum to further restrict faculty independence, control what can be
  taught in the classroom and place partisan appointees in administrative roles.
  The fight ahead Education advocates warn of a looming showdown with faculty
  who are angry their employers aren’t taking more of a stand. The federal cuts
  and uncertain climate have led to hundreds of jobs lost, while the impact on
  scientific and medical research, particularly after the administration cut
  hundreds of millions in National Institutes of Health funds, is reverberating
  beyond academia. Wolfson, the AAUP president, argues that higher education
  unions representing faculty and staff must link arms with students as well as
  businesses and other stakeholders outside the university not only to resist
  the administration’s policies, but also to counter them with a new vision for
  higher education, including campaigns for free public college, an end to
  student debt and more funding for science. “This country is best off when
  higher education is strong,” Wolfson added, warning of a more “militant”
  response on campuses in the fall – including, possibly, mass strikes. “We’re
  going to need to politicize this fight,” he added. “It’s not an economic
  strike around our job conditions – it’s a political strike around the future
  of the sector.”
