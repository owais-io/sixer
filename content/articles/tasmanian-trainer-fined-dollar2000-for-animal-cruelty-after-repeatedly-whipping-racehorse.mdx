  A Tasmanian racehorse trainer has been fined $2,000 after pleading guilty to
  animal cruelty for whipping a horse more than 40 times in four minutes.
  Liandra Gray was found guilty of one count of causing unreasonable and
  unjustifiable pain to 7-year-old thoroughbred gelding The Bolt by striking him
  repeatedly with a padded racing whip. Magistrate Evan Hughes found the charge
  proven after a hearing in the Devonport magistrates court in May, and on
  Wednesday handed down a fine of $2,000, saying the court needed to demonstrate
  a general deterrent to breaches of the Tasmanian Animal Welfare Act. The
  maximum penalty under the act is an $18,000 fine and 12 months’ prison. Sign

  The lightly raced horse has had 11 starts and been unplaced in all, with the
  court hearing from other trainers the gelding had been a difficult horse to
  train. CCTV footage from the Spreyton racecourse, shown to the court, showed
  Gray leading The Bolt into a sand roll – an enclosed yard filled with deep
  sand where horses are allowed to roll after training – and, holding him by the
  bridle, appearing to whip him. The footage did not show the whip making
  contact in all cases, the court heard, but the sound of the whip could be
  heard. Gray told the court in May she was not angry at The Bolt or punishing
  him, and had gone to the sand roll to lunge him, a training technique where
  the horse is encouraged to move out in a circle, using specialist equipment
  which was not used in this case. Hughes said in May that Gray’s explanation
  was “self-serving” and in conflict with the views of expert witnesses. Hughes
  said although there had been no evidence of ongoing injury or pain, he still
  found The Bolt would have suffered moderate to severe pain during the
  incident. The court was earlier told the offence was out of character for Gray
  and she had been under considerable strain at the time, including financial
  stress and an ongoing acrimonious separation from the father of her young
  child, with her parents paying her legal costs. Hughes said he noted Gray’s
  personal circumstances and acknowledged the offence was out of character. He
  also noted the “unwanted media attention” the case had generated, saying it
  served as a form of punishment for Gray. The court heard in earlier
  submissions that Gray had been vilified on social media since the incident and
  deeply regretted her actions. Hughes found that despite being out of
  character, Gray’s actions were deliberate and intentional. He also noted the
  offence was committed at a time when the horse was in a vulnerable position,
  in an enclosed space, and attached to a bridle. Hughes said the fine imposed
  took out into account Gray’s limited financial means, also noting any sentence
  beyond a fine could have a significant impact on Gray’s future in the racing
  industry and the opportunity for further employment. The Tasmanian branch of
  the RSPCA had sought a ban on Gray training or owning animals, but Hughes said
  Gray had no prior convictions under the act at the time and a fine only was
  appropriate in this case. In an unrelated incident, Gray was fined $4,000 in
  2023 by the Tasmanian Office of Racing Integrity for mistreatment of a horse
  under Australian Rules of Racing. An inquiry at the time was told Gray rode a
  horse during training when it was lame and failed to provide adequate
  treatment in a timely manner. Half of that fine was suspended on condition she
  did not reoffend under the same rule for two years, with that term expiring in
  May this year. Gray has been involved in the Tasmanian racing industry for
  more than 20 years, initially as a track worker and later a trainer, having
  trained 39 winners and 33 place-getters, realising more than $1.2m in prize
  money for owners. Martin Agatyn is a reporter in north-west Tasmania Sign up
