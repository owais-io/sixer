  Lucas Paquetá has been cleared of spot-fixing following a two-year
  investigation by the Football Association. The West Ham midfielder was charged
  with four counts of being deliberately booked to influence betting markets on
  Premier League games in May 2024, but the independent regulatory commission
  that heard the case has found the charges to be not proven. Paquetá – who had
  faced a life ban – has asserted his innocence since being made aware the FA
  had been alerted to suspicious betting patterns around bookings he received in
  four Premier League games while playing for West Ham in 2022 and 2023, an
  investigation that led to the collapse of a proposed £85m move to Manchester
  City in August 2023. The 27-year-old has continued to play for West Ham and
  Brazil, who have supported him throughout the process. “Since the first day of
  this investigation I have maintained my innocence against these extremely
  serious accusations,” Paquetá said. “I can’t say anything more at this time,
  but I would like to express how grateful I am to God and how eager I am to
  return to playing football with a smile on my face. To my wife who never let
  go of my hand, to West Ham United, to the fans who always cheered me on, and
  to my family, friends and the legal team who have supported me – thank you for
  everything.” West Ham’s vice-chair, Karren Brady, said: “We are pleased Lucas
  has been cleared. He has maintained his innocence from the outset, and as a
  club we have resolutely stood by him and supported him throughout the process.
  Despite the incredible pressure on him, Lucas has performed week in and week
  out for the Club, always giving everything.”” It has been a difficult time for
  Lucas and his family, but he has remained absolutely professional throughout
  and he is now looking forward to drawing a line under this episode, as is
  everyone at West Ham United.” In a statement, the FA confirmed that the
  alleged breaches of FA Rule E5 were found to be not proven. Two lesser charges
  of failing to cooperate with the FA investigation were upheld, however. While
  the independent commission has yet to determine a sanction, Paquetá is likely
  to be fined. In a charge sheet issued to Paquetá last year, the FA had
  recommended a life ban from football if found guilty. The governing body
  alleged: “Lucas Paquetá directly sought to influence the progress, conduct, or
  any other aspect of, or occurrence in these matches by intentionally seeking
  to receive a card from the referee for the improper purpose of affecting the
  betting market, in order for one or more persons to profit from betting.” The
  matches in question were West Ham’s Premier League fixtures against Leicester
  on 12 November 2022, Aston Villa on 12 March 2023, Leeds on 21 May 2023 and
  Bournemouth on 12 August 2023. Paquetá’s lawyer, Alastair Campbell of Level,
  issued a statement praising the player’s resilience for continuing to play
  with a potential life ban hanging over him. “Few cases carry the gravity of
  this one – professionally, personally and emotionally for our client,”
  Campbell said. “Lucas has faced down immense pressure with remarkable strength
  and resilience. Now, he can finally get back to focusing on the things that
  matter most to him – playing football and being with his family.” The FA will
  not comment further until it has received the written reasons for the
  commission’s verdict, which are expected to be published in a few weeks.
