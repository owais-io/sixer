  My father, Sam Ayer, who has died aged 81, dedicated his life to the care and
  support of vulnerable children and adults. His research made a significant
  contribution to a shift in services from institutional to community care. His
  doctoral thesis, Community Care and the Mentally Handicapped (1984),
  highlighted the key role mothers play in providing care for children with
  learning disabilities, and he played a key role in the English National Board
  for Nursing and Midwifery’s research programme into the development of nursing
  for people with learning disabilities. Born in Akropong, Ghana, Sam lived for
  most of his life in Britain, but he was proud of his Ghanaian heritage and
  continued to speak his native language, Twi, with family and friends. His
  mother, Emma Abena Sika, was a housewife and his father, Kwaku Gyekete, was a
  farmer. After attending the Methodist school in Akropong, Sam trained as a
  teacher at the town’s Presbyterian Training College (now the Presbyterian
  College of Education). Committed to improving the lives of visually impaired
  students, he became a specialist in teaching blind children. In 1970, when he
  was 27, he travelled to the UK to train as a nurse at South Ockenden hospital,
  Essex. During a visit to Ghana in 1983, he met Lucy Yirenkyi, a timekeeper,
  who tracked the working hours of the employees at the Piccadilly biscuit
  factory in Accra. They had a customary marriage in Ghana and later a civil
  marriage at the register office in Hull, east Yorkshire, in 1985. Sam
  enthusiastically embraced any and all opportunities. In 1973, he started
  working as a staff nurse at South Ockendon hospital, which treated patients
  with severe learning difficulties. By 1976, he was the officer in charge at
  the Swansea Children’s Unit while studying for a BA in economics at the city’s
  university. His experience and impressive academic qualifications earned him a
  Social Science Research Council doctoral studentship at the University of
  Hull. In 1982, he became one of the first learning disability nurses to be
  awarded a PhD, and he used his expertise to develop nurse education. He was
  later appointed to a lectureship at the Humberside College of Health, which
  became the University of Hull School of Nursing, and retired in 2008 – but
  this was not the end of his academic career. In 2015 he was invited by the new
  Ghana Baptist University College, in Kumasi, to establish a school of nursing.
  He spent three years as the dean of nursing, where he developed the nursing
  programme, returning to the UK before the Covid-19 pandemic began. Sam is
  survived by Lucy and their three children – his sons, Frederick and Jonathan,
  and me – and by Emma, his daughter from his first marriage, to Janet Quartey,
  which ended in divorce in 1968.
