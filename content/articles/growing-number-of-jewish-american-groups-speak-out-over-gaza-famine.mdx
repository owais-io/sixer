  As global outrage intensifies over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, a growing
  number of prominent Jewish American organizations, including some traditional
  defenders of Israel, are speaking out and imploring the country to ensure that
  humanitarian aid is allowed into Gaza. This week, a UN-backed food security
  group warned that a “worst-case scenario of famine” is unfolding in Gaza and
  health authorities there report dozens of deaths from starvation. On Sunday,
  the American Jewish Committee, a prominent Jewish advocacy organization,
  released a statement affirming that it stands with Israel in what it described
  as “its justified war to eliminate the threat posed by Hamas and secure the
  release of the remaining hostages”. At the same time, the group called for
  Israel to take steps to alleviate civilian suffering. “We feel immense sorrow
  for the grave toll this war has taken on Palestinian civilians, and we are
  deeply concerned about worsening food insecurity in Gaza,” the statement read.
  “We urge Israel, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the UN, and all responsible
  parties involved in aid distribution to increase cooperation and coordination
  in order to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches Palestinian civilians in
  Gaza.” The GHF is an Israel- and US-backed aid group that has attracted
  condemnation for the killings of hundreds of civilians seeking food at the
  hands of Israeli forces and private contractors. The AJC statement reflected a
  cautious critique of Israel’s aid blockade echoed by other groups noteworthy
  for their typically staunch support of the country, even as their statements
  condemned Hamas for refusing to release the Israeli hostages it continues to
  hold. The Reform movement in North America, which represents the largest
  Jewish denomination in the US, also issued a lengthy statement: “Neither
  escalating military pressure nor restricting humanitarian aid has brought
  Israel closer to securing a hostage deal or ending the war,” it read. “Hamas
  has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to sacrifice the Palestinian
  people in its pursuit of Israel’s destruction, but Israel must not sacrifice
  its own moral standing in return. Starving Gazan civilians neither will bring
  Israel the ‘total victory’ over Hamas it seeks, nor can it be justified by
  Jewish values or humanitarian law.” The Rabbinical Assembly, a New York-based
  association of conservative rabbis, said last week that they were
  “increasingly concerned about the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza” and
  called for “urgent action to alleviate civilian suffering and ensure aid
  delivery”. “Even as we believe Hamas could end this suffering immediately
  through the release of the hostages and care for its civilian population, the
  Israeli government must do everything in its power to ensure humanitarian aid
  reaches those in need,” it added. “The Jewish tradition calls upon us to
  ensure the provision of food, water, and medical supplies as a top priority.”
  Jewish groups associated with the left have been prominent fixtures at
  protests against Israel’s offensive since it began. On Tuesday, 27 rabbis and
  Jewish clergy affiliated with the group Jews for Food Aid for People in Gaza
  were arrested at a protest in the Washington office of the Senate majority
  leader, John Thune. But it appears clear that discomfort has significantly
  broadened outside the Jewish left. On Monday, eight rabbis were arrested
  outside the Israeli consulate in New York while protesting against the
  humanitarian crisis in Gaza – including clergy who had not been so outspoken
  before. “The protests we’ve typically seen at the Israeli consulate in places
  like that are from the further left of the community,” Phylisa Wisdom,
  executive director of New York Jewish Agenda, told Gothamist. “This represents
  an escalation from rabbis in this political lane.” More than 1,200 rabbis have
  signed a public letter calling on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into
  Gaza. “The Jewish people face a grave moral crisis, threatening the very basis
  of Judaism as the ethical voice that it has been since the age of Israel’s
  prophets,” reads the letter. “We cannot remain silent in confronting it.” The
  developments reflect shifting public support for Israel and the Israeli
  government within the US, which has accelerated as the war has gone on. A
  recent Gallup poll reported that support for Israel’s military action in Gaza
  has precipitously declined among US adults, and is now at 32% – the lowest
  reading since Gallup first asked the question in November 2023. Support for
  Israel drops further among younger Americans – including US Jews. “It’s a
  tense time in the Jewish family group chats,” Ezra Klein wrote in a recent New
  York Times column. “The consensus that held American Jewry together for
  generations is breaking down.” While emotional attachment to Israel is
  widespread among Jewish Americans, polling has consistently found that support
  for the state’s current policies drops with age, a phenomenon perhaps best
  reflected in the community’s support for the New York Democratic mayoral
  candidate Zohran Mamdani, whom opponents have sought to tar with accusations
  of antisemitism over his vocal support for Palestinian rights. Despite those
  accusations, however, a recent poll found him leading with 67% of the votes of
  American Jewish voters in New York under the age of 44. That figure dropped to
  25% of voters over 45. “Zohran Mamdani’s triumph in New York City’s Democratic
  primary for mayor has forced, among many Jews, a reckoning with how far they
  have drifted from one another,” Klein wrote. Organizers of an action planned
  for Monday in New York City hope that groups that have not turned out before
  will do so to protest under the banner “Jews Say: No More”. “Our tradition
  teaches us that if we can protest [against] our people’s actions and we don’t,
  we are responsible,” said IfNotNow’s executive director, Morriah Kaplan, in a
  statement to the Guardian. The group is helping organize Monday’s action. “As
  Jews and as Americans, whose government is funding this atrocity, we all must
  choose whether we want to bear responsibility for a policy of forced mass
  starvation.” The shift is also playing out within institutions whose members
  want their leaders to take a tougher stance on a country many had long
  reflexively supported. More than 200 alumni from Young Judaea, a Zionist youth
  group, this week called on the organization in an open letter to depart from
  its pro-Israel line to speak out against starvation in Gaza and call for a
  permanent ceasefire, including a release of the hostages. “We see our families
  and friends, colleagues and teachers, rabbis and Jewish institutions – in
  Israel and abroad – join a growing movement to stand courageously in
  opposition to these policies,” the letter reads. “Young Judaea cannot remain
  silent in this moment and maintain any moral credibility.”
