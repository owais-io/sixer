  Heavy monsoon rains have continued to pummel the Indian subcontinent over the
  past week, bringing devastating flooding and landslides and leaving hundreds
  of people dead in what has already been one of the deadliest monsoon seasons
  in recent years. Moist air surging inland from the Bay of Bengal and the
  Arabian Sea was driven into Pakistan and north-west India late last week by
  strong southwesterly monsoon winds. Combined with developing areas of low
  pressure, this triggered a succession of torrential downpours. Last Friday
  more than 300 people were killed after cloudbursts – episodes in which hourly
  rainfall exceeds 100mm – struck mountainous regions of northern Pakistan and
  India. In Buner district, in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, 150mm was
  recorded in just one hour. The downpours unleashed destructive flash floods
  that swept through valleys and villages carrying rocks and debris. More than
  240 people were killed in that single event alone, making it the most
  catastrophic episode of the season so far. Since the onset of the monsoon in
  late May, Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority estimates that
  nearly 750 people have died. Farther south, Mumbai also endured extreme
  rainfall over the last week. Between 15 and 19 August, parts of the city
  recorded 837mm of rain – comparable to the annual average for southern England
  – leading to widespread and prolonged flooding. At least 21 people were
  killed, among them a man who was electrocuted after wading into flood waters
  containing a live wire. Transport was severely disrupted, with roads
  waterlogged, train services halted leaving hundreds stranded on platforms, and
  numerous flights cancelled or diverted. With the Mithi River close to bursting
  its banks, hundreds of residents in low-lying neighbourhoods nearby were
  evacuated to higher ground. Elsewhere, the heatwave that gripped much of
  Europe for more than a week has finally broken, replaced by severe
  thunderstorms. On Wednesday and Thursday about 500,000 lightning strikes were
  detected across the continent, most of them over southern France, Italy and
  the Balkans. Italy bore the brunt of the storms, which were fuelled by an area
  of low pressure moving in from over the unusually warm Mediterranean, allowing
  moist unstable air to clash with the hot air mass that had built during the
  heatwave. Downpours from the storms triggered landslides, uprooted trees and
  blocked roads, and in Sicily rivers burst their banks, sweeping away cars. One
  person remains missing.
