  Re your editorial (The Guardian view on construction workers: the country
  needs more of them, fast, 13 August), as a bricklayer with decades of
  experience, I see the skills shortage in the construction industry as the
  result of years of neglect. The problem is not only attracting new people, but
  keeping them in the trade once they see the reality of working conditions.
  Most site bricklayers are self-employed subcontractors. We don’t get pensions,
  holiday pay, or sick pay. If you’re ill or injured, you simply don’t earn.
  That insecurity pushes many skilled people out of construction entirely. On
  top of that, wages have barely moved in years – in fact, the rates many
  bricklayers receive today are lower than four years ago. Large housebuilders
  often pay good rates to main contractors, but by the time it filters down to
  the bricklayer, they can end up with far less. If the UK is serious about
  meeting its housing targets, we need more than training schemes. We need to
  make construction a job you can build a life on – fair pay directly to the
  tradespeople, proper benefits, and conditions that match the skill and
  physical demands of the work. Until that changes, we’ll keep losing good
  people faster than we can train them, no matter how much money is thrown at
  recruitment. Matthew Ord Peterlee, County Durham • Large construction firms
  routinely depend on multiple levels of subcontracting, involving an ecosystem
  of small and medium-sized enterprises that source labour through a myriad of
  different routes. Those who do the work are often unsure of their own
  employment status. People working alongside each other frequently have very
  different terms and conditions, or indeed, no written terms and conditions at
  all. Career paths do exist, but only in sheltered pockets. The fractured
  nature of the employment model brings obvious advantages to “employers” in
  terms of low overheads. But training is invariably seen as someone else’s
  problem. Many small firms would much prefer to invest in direct employment and
  apprenticeships, but such investment isn’t feasible given the competitive
  dynamics of the marketplace. This is the end point of the industry’s 40-year
  quest for modernisation. Simple solutions are few and far between. But the
  first step for policymakers is to recognise the highly fissured nature of the
  construction employment context. Stuart Green Professor of construction
  management, University of Reading • There are plenty of decent tradespeople
  out there and, of course, some not so good. Yes, we need to bring in more for
  the future, and I’ve no problem with them having formal qualifications. But
  that doesn’t make a tradesperson. I got my City &amp; Guilds in carpentry in
  1997. As I understand it, once my Construction Skills Certificate Scheme card
  runs out, it won’t be renewed unless I make a significant spend to get an NVQ.
  I’ve been in the trade for over 30 years, and I’ve diverged my skill base
  significantly past carpentry alone, all learned on the job. Currently, I have
  no problem getting work, as I’m fairly adept at most building trades. A rush
  to have only the formally qualified working on site will be counterproductive.
  As a self-employed tradesperson, if my work isn’t to standard, I cannot work.
  I’m 51, still fit. If Labour is going to achieve its goals, people like me are
  vital. Mark Stringer King’s Lynn, Norfolk • Have an opinion on anything you’ve
  read in the Guardian today? Please email us your letter and it will be
