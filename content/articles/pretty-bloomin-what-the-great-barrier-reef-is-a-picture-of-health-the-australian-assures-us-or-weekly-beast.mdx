  The Australian Institute of Marine Science’s annual monitoring study came out
  on Wednesday. It warned that the Great Barrier Reef could reach a tipping
  point where it cannot recover fast enough between major catastrophic events.
  The Guardian reported it as: Great Barrier Reef coral bleaching event in 2024
  most widespread and severe on record The ABC: Ecosystem under distress The
  SMH: Record coral decline, mass bleaching The Courier-Mail: Reef in crisis:
  Unprecedented coral decline strikes iconic natural wonder And The Australian?
  Pretty bloomin’ healthy: Reef defying the doomsayers The national broadsheet’s
  Pollyannish view was illustrated with shots of smiling snorkellers giving the
  thumbs up. The headline on a comment piece by Peter Ridd, a former James Cook
  University academic now at the Institute of Public Affairs, said the reef “is
  still doing fine” – “despite having six allegedly cataclysmic coral bleaching
  events in the last decade”. Australia should look to the US, Ridd wrote, where
  “scientists who were once victimised and ostracised have been appointed to
  lead science and medical research institutions” as scientific “groupthink” is
  challenged. Ridd, a geophysicist, was sacked from James Cook University in
  2018 because of what the university called “serious misconduct” in his
  criticism of fellow JCU academics’ reef research but he claimed was simply
  exercising his intellectual freedom as an academic. The IPA then picked him up
  to lead a project called the Project for Real Science. The year after that an
  expert panel warned that Ridd was misrepresenting robust science about the
  reef. In response to the ABC’s Media Watch piece on a similar situation last
  year, Ridd claimed it was “almost certain that a warming climate will be
  beneficial to the corals of the [reef]”. A straighter news piece in the paper
  conceded that the reef had “suffered the largest annual declines in hard coral
  after being hit by the summer’s cyclones and widespread bleaching” as well as
  climate change-induced heat stress. It’s still a “picture of health”, though,
  according to the headline. Bridge too far? Was it another act of
  anti-groupthink by The Australian and other News Corp outlets, or did they
  witness a different Gaza protest to the other media? Hundreds of thousands of
  people turned up to protest against the actions of Israel in the war on Gaza,
  the civilian death toll and the widespread hunger and starvation. Most reports
  on the peaceful march across Sydney Harbour Bridge focused on the huge
  turnout, with some criticism of the police. Sign up to get Guardian
  Australia’s weekly media diary as a free newsletter Some outlets had a
  laser-like focus on a single protester who was holding aloft a picture of the
  Iranian dictator, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Where some saw an enormous coming
  together of people wanting to show their empathy and outrage, others saw
  sympathisers instead of sympathy. In Monday’s Australian, for example, the
  cartoonist John Spooner depicted the march as a range of people, one carrying
  a bag labelled “hate”, another labelled “hostages”. There were signs that read
  “Long live October 7”, “Useful idiots”, and “Make lies not war”. The
  centrepiece was a skeletal Grim Reaper with a Hamas headband carrying a bag
  labelled “anti-semitism” saying: “It’s lovely to feel so appreciated”, all
  under the baffling title “pilgrims’ progress”. A mind of its own Elon Musk’s
  AI chatbot Grok, which went Nazi-ish in July on the platform formerly known as
  Twitter, wandered into the culture wars again this week. Set off by a post
  about burning the Australian flag, it had a crack at untangling a nuanced
  debate about freedoms versus accountability, and took a deep dive into the
  Middle East and disputes about definitions of genocide. It also referred to
  the “harrowing emaciation and wounds” in pictures of children in Gaza and
  accused rightwing media of downplaying Israel’s actions. And it said the ABC
  was more impartial than others, and that Australia’s rightwing media ignored
  diversity reforms and prioritised profit via sensationalism and the pro-Israel
  lobby influence (if that doesn’t make complete sense, please ask Grok for an
  explanation). Diversity of views Sky After Dark is looking to radically depart
  from its roster of conservative pundits to add another face who works for the
  Institute of Public Affairs, has Liberal party links and is promising to
  “tackle controversial topics with no holds barred”. The former Liberal
  candidate for Balmain Freya Leach will premiere her Freya Fires Up segment on
  Sunday 17 August. She has already boosted her profile and shown her appetite
  for robust debate through notable media appearances, including complaining
  about a university assignment where a rightwing character bore her first name,
  which she said was “clearly intended” to depict her (the university said it
  was a coincidence), and appearing in news stories as an “everyday woman being
  pummelled by Australia’s cost of living crisis” and complaining about taxes
  more than once, according to Media Watch. A bit rich The Australian has
  launched a new wealth section (with a new “watch and jewellery editor”)
  featuring advice such as how to cope with changes to tax breaks for super
  accounts holding more than $3m. One of the stories was awkwardly juxtaposed
  with another showing that you need a fraction of that amount to retire
  comfortably. Introducing the new section, The Australian’s editor, Michelle
  Gunn, wrote about everyday millionaires “or Emilli as they’re being coined”.
  Coined, geddit? And she pointed out that the average wealth per adult
  Australian was close to $800,000, which surely saw jaws drop to the floor
  outside Sydney’s north shore. But average wealth is hardly indicative of what
  the average Australian is experiencing because it gets bumped up by those up
  the pointy end. A story from the ABC earlier in the week revealed that there
  are plenty of millionaires in Australia, and the nation has the second-highest
  median wealth in the world at $411,000 – about half the “average” cited in the
  Oz (although the ABC story put average wealth at $952,000). So where are all
  these piles of cash? Mostly in property, of course, and predominantly with the
  rich, with the top 10% of Australians holding 44% of the nation’s wealth. The
  typical Australian makes about $56,000 a year. Social competition Here’s a
  slightly brighter spot in what feels like a bleak landscape – new research has
  found news shared on social media is more diverse. A University of South
  Australia lecturer, Cameron McTernan, studied Facebook posts from Australian
  newsrooms and found they were “much more diverse than news shared by
  traditional media, with many different news sources and voices”. But he also
  warned it was a “double-edged sword”. “While social media can provide better
  discoverability of news, it also competes with traditional outlets for
  revenue,” he said. “The two competing industries are struggling to find a
  cooperative path forward and ultimately that hurts newsrooms a lot more than
  tech firms, and ultimately, it hurts all of us.” Farewell to one of the best
  Kate McClymont described him as “one of the [Sydney Morning Herald]’s wittiest
  writers”; Peter FitzSimons said he was “the best writer of hilarious light
  prose”, and his old paper, the SMH, said his “innovative daily column Stay in
  Touch helped lift the Herald into a golden age of rising circulation and
  influence”. David Dale died this week aged 77 and is survived by his wife,
  Susan Williams, and daughter, Millie. According to the SMH, his column
  “pricked the pomposity of politicians in Macquarie Street or Canberra, ran
  snippets of bizarre reports from around the world that usually ended up
  ignored in the wastebaskets of teleprinter rooms, and mixed fact, fiction,
  satire, gossip and humour with Dale’s distaste for sycophancy that bustled the
  then broadsheet Herald into the 1980s”. He also worked for ABC radio and 2GB
  Sydney, and was a journalism lecturer.
