  Illinois’s governor JB Pritzker has called on “all to stand up” to Donald
  Trump as the US president prepares to launch a federally led immigration
  crackdown across Chicago, a plan which has been met with widespread backlash
  from local leaders and the public. Pritzker’s comments come as White House
  officials vow to target Chicago next in its sweeping immigration crackdowns
  across the country. Recently, the White House requested that a US military
  base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as the
  Trump administration plans a broader takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary
  cities”. Pritzker, a Democrat, told CBS on Sunday: “Any kind of troops on the
  streets of an American city don’t belong unless there is an insurrection,
  unless there is truly an emergency. There is not … I’m going to do everything
  I can to stop him from taking away people’s rights and from using the military
  to invade states. I think it’s very important for us all to stand up.”
  Pritzker spoke after Trump on Saturday took to Truth Social to rant about
  Pritzker and Chicago, saying: “JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of
  Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is
  CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!” Meanwhile,
  Pritzker said that no one from the Trump administration has contacted his
  team, the city of Chicago or any other local officials. In his interview with
  CBS, he said: “It’s clear that they’re secretly planning this. If they
  actually send in US troops, it would amount to an invasion. They should be
  coordinating with local law enforcement, telling us when and where they’re
  coming, and whether it’s Ice, ATF, or another agency. But they’re not doing
  that. And I have to say, it’s disruptive and dangerous. It stirs up tension on
  the ground when we’re left in the dark and can’t coordinate with them.”
  Pritzker also pushed back against accusations from Kristi Noem, the secretary
  of homeland security, who said that Illinois “refuses to have our back”.
  “That’s not true,” he said, adding: “There were police officers who made sure
  that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the Ice
  officials that were here … People have a right to their first amendment … and
  we protect that too in the city of Chicago … We have our job, which is to
  fight violent crime on the streets of our city and by the way, we’re
  succeeding at that job, but when they bring people in and don’t coordinate
  with us, they’re going to cause enormous problems.” Pritzker continued: “If he
  wants to send troops, he should call. I’ve been very clear about what it is
  that we’d like help with. But, instead, he’s talking about sending troops.
  Nobody’s called, literally nobody from the White House … If they actually
  wanted to help, they might call and say, what help do you need? … I don’t know
  why they haven’t bothered to reach out if they have plans of their own, but
  honestly, we’d be happy to receive a call.” The governor also accused Trump of
  having “other aims, other than fighting crime”, pointing out the handful of
  Democratic cities that have been the target of Trump’s immigration crackdowns,
  including Washington DC and Los Angeles. “The other aims are that he’d like to
  stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections. He’ll
  just claim that there’s some problem with an election, and then he’s got
  troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he’s allowed to do
  this. We have sovereignty,” Pritzker said. With an imminent federal crackdown
  in Chicago expected to take place as soon as the end of this week, Chicago’s
  mayor, Brandon Johnson, signed an executive order on Saturday in an effort to
  push back against the White House’s “out of control” plan to deploy federal
  troops into the city. The new order bars Chicago police from aiding federal
  authorities with civil immigration enforcement or related patrols, as well as
  traffic stops and checkpoints during the crackdown. Johnson also ordered all
  city departments to protect the constitutional rights of the city’s residents
  “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or national guard
  deployment by the federal government”.
