  Half a century of unprecedented success, six Super Bowl rings as a head coach,
  the NFL’s greatest defensive mind; all undone by 19-year-olds sprinting past
  missed tackles. Bill Belichick arrived at North Carolina promising to bend
  college football to his will, to build the “33rd NFL Program” in Chapel Hill,
  and prove he still had his fastball. College football laughed. As debut flops
  go, North Carolina’s 48-14 beatdown at the hands of TCU is as bad as it gets.
  Belichick’s side didn’t just lose; they were humiliated. UNC looked
  unprepared, undisciplined and were overmatched against a veteran team. This
  was supposed to be Belichick’s coronation. That the greatest coach in modern
  NFL history had deigned to grace the college game triggered Belichick Fever.
  Michael Jordan, Lawrence Taylor and Mia Hamm patrolled the Carolina sideline
  on Monday night. ESPN sent its A-Team and treated the opener like a stand-in
  for Monday Night Football. Kenan Stadium had been sold out for months. UNC
  invested in new suites for the big-dollar donor who forked out over $10m to
  land the greatest to ever do it. By half-time, His Airness had left the
  building. So had half the stadium. For a moment, there was promise. The Tar
  Heels struck first, putting together a seven-play, 83-yard touchdown drive.
  Then everything collapsed. TCU settled down and scored 41 unanswered points as
  Belichick’s team dissolved and the coach stood stoically on the sideline. From
  the beginning, Belichick looked out of place amid college football’s
  pageantry. This is a sport of goofy traditions, rabid student sections and
  grown men putting their mortgages in the hands of teenagers. Even Nick Saban,
  chief curmudgeon, would bow down to college football and its lunacy, flashing
  a smile during pre-game interviews, knowing that every moment on camera was a
  chance to pull in another recruit. Belichick, standing in his vintage cut-off
  hoodie, was unwilling to play the game, sticking to the say-nothing persona
  that characterized his time in the pros. Maybe he had nothing to say. Maybe
  Belichick knew, with this roster, a humiliation was on the way. And make no
  mistake: this was a humbling loss. In 511 NFL games, Belichick’s defenses
  never conceded 48 points. It took just one game in college for his defense to
  fall apart. He was spared the indignity of conceding 50 points thanks only to
  TCU kneeling the ball on a goal-to-go situation rather than running up the
  score. This is how college goes. There is no warmup, preseason, exhibition
  games or long training camp. It’s straight to primetime, and Belichick and his
  roster were not ready for the lights. “They just outplayed us, they outcoached
  us and they were better than we were. That’s all there is to it,” Belichick
  said after the game. “They did a lot more things right than we did. Give them
  credit for being the better team.” Everything that could go wrong, did go
  wrong. North Carolina turned the ball over three times. They gave up 542 total
  yards. They missed more tackles than the stat trackers could count in
  real-time. They couldn’t run the ball, convert on third downs, or hold TCU’s
  explosive offense at bay. Kirk Herbstreit had to shoehorn his dog on to the
  broadcast to keep America engaged. “We all felt a little disrespect coming
  in,” TCU head coach Sonny Dykes said. “There was a lot of conversation, and
  none of it was about us.” Dykes’s team spent four hours taking it out on
  Belichick. The signs of what was to come were there pre-game. Belichick
  refused to put out a depth chart, leaving even ESPN scrambling to figure out
  who was playing. It felt pure Belichick: guarding personnel moves like the
  KGB, revealing nothing, trying to pinch an advantage. Instead, after a handful
  of drives, it felt like a move to hide the obvious: his team lack talent. The
  gap between TCU and UNC was jarring. UNC didn’t just look undermanned; they
  looked like one of the least talented squads in the Power Four – the elite
  conferences of college football – particularly along the line of scrimmage.
  They couldn’t stymie TCU’s run game or generate any push up front on offense,
  averaging a lowly two yards a carry. That falls on Belichick. This is a team
  of his creation, built in his image. He didn’t inherit a downtrodden program
  but rather a school that had stagnated. Belichick, along with Mike Lombardi,
  Belichick’s close confidante, a former NFL GM and the new personnel czar at
  North Carolina, oversaw an unparalleled overhaul this offseason, bringing in
  70 new players. That’s more than an NFL franchise can turn over in three
  years, crammed into a single summer. Roster construction was supposed to be
  one of Belichick’s strengths. He would chuck his Super Bowl rings on the
  table, promise recruits he would get them ready for the pros and the nation’s
  best would flock to Chapel Hill. Monday was a painful reminder that, despite
  the advent of NIL, college football is a different world from the NFL. In the
  NFL, parity is legislated. No matter how barren your roster, there’s always a
  path to recovery baked into the rules. In college, there is no salary cap or
  draft. Free agency is year-round. You cannot plug roster holes during the
  season or swing a meaningful trade. Want to upgrade your roster? You have to
  recruit players. That means decades-long relationships with high school
  coaches, building a pipeline, dancing on TikTok with 17-year-olds and having
  the funds to get the deal over the line while other schools circle. One game
  will not define Belichick’s college career. But the manner of defeat should
  set off all the alarm bells. Belichick has always been the ultimate problem
  solver. But at 73, in a sport where problems begin in living rooms and on high
  school fields, he’s still figuring out what the issues are. “We just keep
  working and keep grinding away,” Belichick said. “We’re better than what we
  were tonight, but we have to go out and prove it. Nobody’s going to do it for
  us.” For whatever reason Belichick took the UNC job – money, ego, thumbing his
  nose at the NFL, setting his sons up with jobs – Monday provided him a chance
  to erase the memories of his final few, unsuccessful years in New England. But
  it was such a debacle that you could only feel schadenfreude or sadness. Is
  this really what you want to be doing in your 70s? Why not go sit on your boat
  in Nantucket? “Big moments are won by winning all the small moments that come
  before them,” Belichick wrote in his recent book. In the run-up to his debut,
  the small moments have been enveloped in chaos. For a man obsessed with
  control, Belichick’s time in college has been defined by turmoil. There has
  been the roster churn, the strange CBS Morning interview, a media firestorm
  about his romance with the much younger Jordon Hudson, reports that Hudson was
  banned from UNC’s facilities, the Hard Knocks debacle, and worries from the
  school faculty and program boosters about his level of engagement. Sure,
  digging into Belichick’s private life felt like a TMZ-ification of the sport.
  But Monday showed why the off-field drama mattered. It was indicative of a
  coach who had lost his way. Belichick spent more than two decades as an NFL
  head coach preaching about distractions, and then spent the first six months
  at UNC dragging his program into the tabloids. His time in college has been
  about everything except his football team. On Monday, we found out why. “It’s
  a little like the Deion [Sanders] thing at Colorado,” ACC commissioner Jim
  Phillips said at the conference’s media day. “He grabs your attention. It’s
  made for television.” There are a lot of Jon Sumralls out there. That’s not to
  dismiss Sumrall’s skills or the insta-rebuild job he has done at Tulane.
  Sumrall has done fantastically in college, in part because he has prepared for
  it – the bounty of an adult life spent grinding through college football’s
  lower ranks, scouting high schoolers, recruiting, clapping the marching band,
  shaking hands with school booster, working with his school president, the
  wider faculty and surrounding himself with people who model the stamina and
  skills needed to succeed in college football. There are plenty of those
  coaches, and they cost considerably less than the $10m a year that Belichick
  earns. But none of those coaches is Bill Belichick. With Belichick, UNC looked
  past college lifers and chased the starry name; the big fish could boost
  interest for a program that has stagnated. They wanted some of the Deion
  Sanders Effect. Plenty of schools will chase the Deion sugar high (don’t check
  Colorado’s record this season), but will ignore a pivotal point: there is only
  one Deion. Sanders worked his way up the college ranks, starting as a high
  school coach, then moving up to college before he jumped to a Power Four
  school. Sanders also brought with him the best player in the country and an
  NFL-caliber quarterback. Belichick did not rock up at UNC with Travis Hunter
  and Shedeur Sanders. He’s a 73-year-old coach overseeing a multi-year rebuild
  – time is not on his side. It’s not going to get easier this year. North
  Carolina were supposed to have a favorable schedule this year. But based on
  Monday, they will be one of the weaker teams in their conference. Clemson and
  Cal will inflict serious punishment, while Wake Forest, Duke and NC State will
  now be firm favorites to beat them. Belichick’s winning trait in the NFL was
  his adaptability. Season-to-season, opponent-to-opponent, he would shapeshift
  to fit what was needed. He had the vision to see what would work, and the
  expertise to install and run it. In the pros, with the game’s best talent,
  that worked. Adapting that to the college game, with a left tackle sprinting
  between football practice and calculus, is an enormous task. Belichick’s move
  to college, right as the sport moved closer to the professional ranks, was
  full of intrigue. Could the greatest coach in the modern history of the NFL
  turn a college program bursting with potential into a powerhouse in the
  twilight of his career? After one game, UNC’s gambit looks like a disaster.
  After Monday, the bar for Belichick’s first season has been set spectacularly
  low: win four games and keep his job.
