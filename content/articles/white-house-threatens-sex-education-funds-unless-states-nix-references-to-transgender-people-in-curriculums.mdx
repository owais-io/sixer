  The Trump administration has told US states and territories they will lose
  federal funding for their sex education programs if they do not remove
  references to transgender people. In letters sent to 46 states, territories
  and Washington DC on Tuesday, the Administration for Children and Families
  (ACF) demanded they “remove all references to gender ideology” within 60 days
  or risk losing funding from the Personal Responsibility Education Program, or
  Prep. The Prep initiative was created in 2010 to help prevent teen pregnancies
  and sexually transmitted infections. “Accountability is coming,” said Andrew
  Gradison, acting assistant secretary of ACF, which is part of the Department
  of Health and Human Services. “Federal funds will not be used to poison the
  minds of the next generation or advance dangerous ideological agendas. The
  Trump administration will ensure that Prep reflects the intent of Congress,
  not the priorities of the left.” Last week, the Trump administration
  terminated a grant worth millions of dollars to California after the state
  refused to remove references to gender identity, transgender people and
  non-binary people from its sex education curriculum. This threat has now been
  extended to a further 40 states, as well as territories and Washington DC. In
  the letters sent to the jurisdictions, the Trump administration cites examples
  of each curriculum that it claims are outside the scope of Prep, such as
  mentions of transgender people, gender expression and diversity. The amount of
  federal funding at stake depends on each state. New York, for example, could
  lose the most, at $6m, while Delaware’s grant is the smallest of the states,
  at $333,000. The administration’s demand to states is just the latest move by
  Trump to remove federal recognition of trans people and defund any program
  that mentions them. The president has already issued executive orders
  declaring there are only two unchangeable sexes, banning trans girls from
  female sports teams, stopping trans people from joining the military and
  blocking federal funding to hospitals that provide transition support for
  young people. Critics of Trump said the move will cause harm to young people.
  “If it’s a day ending in y, President Trump is attacking kids’ safety, health
  and access to education as part of his culture war,” a spokesperson for Gavin
  Newsom, California’s governor, told NBC in a statement. “Studies consistently
  show us that LGBTQ+ students, especially trans and non-binary youth, face
  higher rates of bullying, harassment and suicide,” said Jorge Reyes Salinas,
  communications director for the LGBTQ+ civil rights organization Equality
  California. “Especially now, we’re seeing those numbers skyrocket. Inclusive
  education reduces stigma and saves lives.”
