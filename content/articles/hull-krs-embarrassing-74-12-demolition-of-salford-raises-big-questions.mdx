  This was anything but the kind of advert Super League clubs who voted to
  expand the competition to 14 teams in 2026 would have hoped for. This may well
  be the last time we see Salford versus Hull KR as a Super League fixture for
  some time. There is a growing feeling that, even with two more teams joining
  the elite next year, Salford’s position is increasingly untenable as they
  remain riddled by financial problems. Having been forced to request an advance
  on their central distribution on the eve of the season, a takeover in February
  was hoped to be the cure for their long-term ills. But 20 rounds into the
  season, Salford remain under salary-cap constraints, have had to sell players
  to make ends meet and are still in deep financial trouble. A
  multimillion-pound bridging loan that has long been promised by the owners has
  not arrived. Salford’s young players that are left are being forced to turn
  out every week when they are not ready for Super League, and the results are
  ones like these. This win for Hull KR, their biggest as a top-flight club, was
  a mismatch from the first minute. There is no blame attached to Salford’s
  young squad, who continue to apply themselves superbly in the face of such
  adversity, their coaching staff or those on the terraces who are passionately
  backing this group until the end of the season and will continue to do so
  whatever may come after that. It may well be life in the Championship. The
  blame lies with Salford’s ownership, and there is no doubting the uncertainty
  that has lasted so deep into the season is causing reputational damage to the
  club, but also to Super League. It was a point not lost on the Hull KR coach,
  Willie Peters. He said: “I’m not sure what to feel because the situation
  Salford are in is not good. I feel for [Salford coach] Paul Rowley, the
  players and the fans who are turning up every week. Some people have got to be
  held accountable because it’s embarrassing for our game over here. It does not
  help anyone.” Having watched his side concede 14 tries, Rowley appeared
  emotionally drained. He said: “I’m not sure what the emotion is. I’m bored of
  it, I’m sick of it. We just want to compete. It’s not what we want to see.
  We’re sad at the situation and we’re sad for the sport because we don’t want
  to be in this position.” Some Super League coaches have expressed concerns
  there are not enough players to support 14 elite teams and while Salford have
  their own problems that contributed to this score, this will have done little
  to assuage those fears. It is worth crediting the imperious Super League
  leaders, though. They scored points at will here to underline the gulf between
  these two sides. The reigning Man of Steel, Mikey Lewis, provided an
  incredible eight try assists and scored one of his own, with Rovers 14-0 up
  after ten minutes and 34-6 ahead by the break. Any suggestion they would ease
  up in a show of mercy for a young Salford side was unfounded. Lewis continued
  to torment the Red Devils after the break, with Joe Burgess crossing for four
  tries in total and Peters’ men picking up their biggest ever victory as a
  Super League club. Their bigger challenges lie ahead, specifically the
  defending champions Wigan in a fortnight. As for Salford, it is unclear how
  much longer they will be a Super League club for but their challenges are the
  same as the competition itself: minimising reputational damage and convincing
  the public better times lie ahead.
