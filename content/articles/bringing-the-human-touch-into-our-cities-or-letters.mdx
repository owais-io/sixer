  Carlo Ratti’s welcome call for the humanising of urban public spaces (We used
  AI to analyse three cities. It’s true: we now walk more quickly and socialise
  less, 18 August) chimes well with Thomas Heatherwick’s latest series of
  Building Soul on Radio 4, where his prime concern is to encourage joy in our
  built environment. May I make the case for a too often overlooked space in the
  heart of Preston? Winckley Square is composed of largely Georgian townhouses
  that define an undulating park. In the mid-20th century, a public space was
  created with paths laid out in “desire lines” across the square. By the 21st
  century, repeated flooding under an overarching tree canopy made for a
  distinctively less inviting place. But trees felled in the wake of the ash
  dieback disease, together with landscaping and rebuilt culverts, have had an
  enlightening effect. The gardens, looked after by the Friends of Winckley
  Square, host a programme of social and heritage events. Now, associations with
  the likes of Gerard Manley Hopkins, the suffragette Edith Rigby, the graphic
  novelist Bryan Talbot and the Beano artist Leo Baxendale are being looked at,
  with a view to setting up links to explore their work and inspire contemporary
  writers. Austen Lynch Garstang, Lancashire • Carlo Ratti presents fascinating
  AI-generated data on how people use public open space, arguing that this can
  be used to design spaces better, and suggesting architects should use these AI
  tools. There are some truly outstanding public spaces designed by architects.
  But the professionals best placed to use these tools, to evaluate the
  conditions and to design creatively in response, are landscape architects (or
  multidisciplinary teams that include landscape architects). Annie Coombs
  Fellow of the Landscape Institute
