  Zohran Mamdani pulled in almost double the funds of his nearest rivals for New
  York City mayor between early July and mid-August, as the candidates prepare
  for the crucial post Labor Day push to the November poll. New York’s City’s
  campaign finance board said on Saturday that the democratic socialist, who won
  the Democratic party nomination in June against former state governor Andrew
  Cuomo, raised $1,051,200, with an average donation of $121 recorded equally
  from donors in and outside the state. Cuomo raised $541,301, with an
  contribution size of $646. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, running as an
  independent, raised $425,181, with an average donation of $770. Republican
  candidate Curtis Sliwa brought in $407, 332. Mamdani’s fundraising dominance
  is mirrored in a polling advantage. Last week, a Siena poll placed him at 19
  points ahead of Cuomo, his nearest rival, who is also running as an
  independent. A 12-poll average from Decision Desk HQ puts Mamdani ahead of
  Cuomo by 13 points. Mamdani, who has proposed rent freezes on almost a million
  rent-stabilized apartments in the city, free buses and childcare, city-run
  grocery stores, and elevated taxes on Columbia and New York University to
  subsidize city colleges and trade schools, has been consistently ahead in
  fundraising over rivals. In March, he asked his campaign’s grassroots
  supporters to stop donating, and directed his primary campaign staff to
  encourage supporters’ focus to volunteering efforts. His campaign funds on
  hand are put at $4.4m, and his campaign is eligible for $2.2m more in matching
  public funds. Last week, it was revealed that the anti-billionaire candidate
  had received a donation of $250,000 to a political action committee from
  Elizabeth Simons, the daughter of late hedge fund billionaire Jamie Simons.
  Adams is barred from receiving matching campaign funds, the city campaign
  finance board having found he had violated related laws. Cuomo has begun
  transferring money from a $7.5m state campaign account to his city campaign
  account and has $1.2m on hand. Cuomo is in line for a payout of about $400,000
  from public funds. Pressure on the two trailing candidates, Adams and Sliwa,
  to step out of the race is likely to increase next month, but both have said
  they are unwilling to do so. Last week, Adams repeated his resistance to
  dropping out after a close adviser, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, was indicted for
  allegedly running a political-favors scheme that included receiving seafood
  and an acting role opposite Forest Whitaker. Politco reported last week that
  Cuomo told supporters at a fundraiser he expects Republican leaders, including
  Donald Trump, to urge Republican voters to switch from Sliwa to stop Mamdani,
  whom Trump has branded “a 100% Communist Lunatic”. Mamdani has said he is
  “Donald Trump’s worst nightmare”. Cuomo said on Friday that “a lot is going to
  happen” between now and the November vote. “I don’t think the public even
  knows who the assemblyman is, what he represents, what his positions are. So I
  think the more they find out about him, the less they’re going to like him,
  and … his appeal is going to drop dramatically.” Mamdani, meanwhile, has
  accused Cuomo of lying about his coordination with Trump and says the former
  governor, who bitterly clashed with Trump while in office, is now seeking the
  president’s help. “It’s par for the course for Andrew Cuomo,” Mamdani said on
  Tuesday.
