  It is rare to find such a decorated athlete – one with a regal moniker, no
  less – who still thrives on being the underdog. Australia’s Kyle Chalmers,
  “King Kyle”, has won just about everything there is to win in international
  swimming. Yet year after year he returns, somehow still the underdog, somehow
  ready to spring another upset. In recent days, at the 2025 World Aquatics
  Championships in Singapore, it has been more of the same. On Sunday, Chalmers
  anchored Australia’s relay team to an unexpected gold in the men’s 4×100m
  freestyle relay. On Thursday, he will go again in the individual event – the
  two-lap freestyle blitz, another opportunity for Chalmers to reign supreme.
  Arise, King Kyle, once more? The modern Chalmers story began nearly a decade
  ago, at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Just 18, the boy from Port
  Lincoln qualified for the Games at trials alongside more-fancied compatriot
  Cameron McEvoy. Chalmers had pedigree – he had won three gold medals at the
  junior world championships a year before – but this was the blue riband event
  of the Olympic swim meet, with a stacked field. No one gave Chalmers a chance.
  And yet he shocked teammate McEvoy and the swimming world to touch first in a
  remarkable upset, the youngest male swimmer to win an individual gold since
  Ian Thorpe in 2000. In less than 48 seconds, an international swim star was
  born. The nine years that followed have been glittering. Chalmers has won
  seven Commonwealth Games gold medals, six world titles and eight more Olympic
  medals. Now 27, Chalmers has established himself as a mainstay of the
  Australian Dolphins, the leading light of the squad’s male contingent. But
  somehow, Chalmers has always positioned himself as the underdog. In part it is
  because of the injuries that have plagued his career. From bulged discs to a
  degenerative spine, from shoulder problems to heart surgery, there has been a
  lengthy list of ailments. Chalmers has endured endless cortisone injections
  and plasma therapy; at one point he even hurt himself while lying on a couch
  (after a stint working as a landscaper, he said his body was not used to the
  rest). “And that’s just the physical side of things,” he said in Tokyo,
  acknowledging the mental challenges that come with such exertions. It may, in
  part, be explained by Chalmers always doing things his own way – contemplating
  swapping swimming for a career in the AFL, or working part-time as a tradie
  for much of his career. Certainly, in part it is his mentality. Chalmers
  thrives with his back against the wall, the doubt of others seems to fuel him.
  At the Tokyo Olympics, this reporter made a joking reference that the women
  had been carrying the Dolphins to glory – was it now the men’s turn? To
  Chalmers, it was no joke. On Sunday, at the latest edition of the world
  titles, the Australian men’s freestyle relay team were not expected to win
  gold. The Dolphins had won the event just once over the past decade; the
  Americans have been ascendant, winning the past three Olympic golds. But
  Chalmers always lifts for relays – it is no surprise a majority of his world
  and Olympic medals have been in team disciplines. It has so often been the
  scene of his heroic feats. And so again it was on Sunday; the Australians were
  third at the final changeover, before Chalmers powered home with a fearsome
  46.53 split to finish over the top of the American rivals. King Kyle once
  more. But after the win, the underdog mentality was again on display. “I think
  it’s a huge upset, and we prove that time and time again,” Chalmers said.
  “Every year you read the articles and people write us off. We have a point to
  prove and swim with a chip on our shoulder a little bit, to be honest with
  you.” How many six-time world champions, nine-time Olympic medallists swim
  with a chip on their shoulder? On Thursday, Chalmers will contest the final in
  his pet 100m freestyle event, after qualifying through the heats and
  semi-final on Wednesday. It is shaping up to be a blockbuster clash. Chalmers
  won gold at the last major world championships, two years ago in Japan, but
  the Australian was blown away by young Chinese rival Pan Zhanle at the Paris
  Olympics, who shaved almost half a second off his own world record. In
  Singapore, Chalmers will go head to head with Romanian prodigy David Popovici
  and America’s Jack Alexy, who qualified fastest. Popovic is just 20; Alexy is
  22. Despite only being 27, Chalmers is the field’s elder statesman, contesting
  his fifth world championships. Pan, another member of the next generation at
  20, is a surprise absence from the final, after a lacklustre semi-final
  showing. Despite Chalmers’ glittering career, he has only once been world
  champion in the individual 100m freestyle – in 2023 – and once at the Olympic
  level, back in 2016 (silver in Paris behind Pan followed a heartbreaking
  silver in Tokyo, six one-hundredths of a second from victory). Will this be
  the moment King Kyle reasserts his dominance over a field of princeling
  upstarts? Could Olympic gold follow in Los Angeles in three years’ time?
  Chalmers has even floated the possibility of swimming on to Brisbane 2032,
  particularly following the addition of the 50m butterfly to the Olympic
  programme. He may not be the favourite on Thursday night. But that has never
  stopped Kyle Chalmers before.
