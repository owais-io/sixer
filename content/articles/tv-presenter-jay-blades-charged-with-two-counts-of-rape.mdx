  The TV presenter Jay Blades has been charged with two counts of rape, police
  have said, and will appear in court next week. West Mercia police said in a
  statement: “Jason Blades, 55, of Claverley in Shropshire, has been charged
  with two counts of rape. He is due to appear at Telford magistrates court on
  13 August 2025.” Separately on Tuesday, Blades, who fronted the BBC primetime
  show The Repair Shop, appeared at Worcester crown court via video link for a
  preliminary hearing in relation to a charge of controlling or coercive
  behaviour. He denied engaging in controlling or coercive behaviour towards his
  estranged wife, Lisa-Marie Zbozen, between 1 January 2023 and 12 September
  last year. Blades became a well-known figure thanks to The Repair Shop, in
  which members of the public take damaged but treasured family heirlooms to be
  restored by a team of experts. His rise from furniture maker to TV celebrity
  was meteoric after he first featured on the show in 2017. Raised in Hackney,
  east London, Blades got his break on programme after being discovered by TV
  producers who saw a short film about Out of the Dark, a charity he co-founded
  that taught young people how to restore and sell old furniture. He received an
  MBE in 2021. In 2024, Blades stepped back from presenting The Repair Shop,
  according to the BBC.
