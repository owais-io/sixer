  New Zealand plans to start charging international tourists fees to enter its
  famous natural sites and will make it easier for businesses to operate on
  conservation land as part of a controversial proposal to “unleash” growth on
  ecologically and culturally protected areas. The government plans to start
  charging foreign visitors NZ$20-40 ($12-24) per person to access some sites.
  Initially, those would probably include Cathedral Cove/Te Whanganui-a-Hei,
  Tongariro Crossing, Milford Sound and Aoraki Mount Cook. The fees are likely
  to be imposed from 2027. The conservation minister, Tama Potaka, said those
  fees could generate NZ$62m a year “so we can keep investing in the sites that
  underpin so much of our tourism sector”. The government’s announcements form
  part of a wider shake-up of conservation law that will also make selling or
  exchanging conservation land easier and allow more activities to go ahead on
  conservation without needing a permit. “In the spirit of saying yes to more
  jobs, more growth and higher wages”, the government would “unleash a fresh
  wave of concessions” including in tourism, agriculture and infrastructure at
  some locations, the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said on Saturday.
  Conservation land is protected, publicly owned land and makes up a third of
  New Zealand territory. It covers areas with biodiversity, historic or cultural
  value. Some businesses such as ski fields and grazing already operated on
  conservation land but many other businesses struggled to gain the same
  permission, Luxon said. It is the latest policy that seeks to loosen
  regulation on natural sites and species to enable economic growth. In 2024,
  the government passed a law that could see contentious mining and
  infrastructure projects fast-tracked for approval. It has also proposed a law
  change to make it easier for companies to kill protected wildlife in order to
  pursue certain infrastructure projects. Conservation and climate initiatives
  have also faced budget cuts. But critics say the changes risk harming the
  environment and vulnerable species. New Zealand has high rates of endemic
  biodiversity but some species are in worrying decline, with a high proportion
  threatened or at risk of extinction. Green party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick
  said Luxon was putting profit above the protection of nature. “That tells us
  everything we need to know about who he thinks he works for. It’s not regular
  people, future generations or a healthy environment,” she said in a statement
  to the Guardian. Nicola Toki, the chief executive of New Zealand’s largest
  conservation organisation, Forest &amp; Bird, said the latest reforms
  “represent the most significant weakening of conservation law in a generation”
  and would increase pressure on vulnerable species. “They shift the focus from
  protection to exploitation, dismantling the very purpose of our national parks
  and conservation lands.” • This story was amended on 5 August 2025 to reflect
  new information provided by the government that fees will apply to Milford
  Sound, not Milford Track.
