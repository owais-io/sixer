  Ministers are considering scrapping a commitment to spend 80% of foreign aid
  on projects supporting gender equality, the Guardian has learned. Critics
  warned the move could worsen the impact of Donald Trump’s rollback of funding
  for diversity and aid projects abroad, which has affected maternal and
  reproductive health services in developing countries. The Conservative
  government committed in 2023 to ensuring that 80% of the Foreign Office’s
  bilateral aid programmes had a focus on gender equality by 2030. Labour
  ministers reaffirmed the commitment earlier this year. Stephen Doughty, a
  junior Foreign Office minister, said ministers would continue to work towards
  the target in March, even after the government had announced it was cutting
  international aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of GDP to spend more on defence. Under the
  target, 80% of aid spending must go to programmes that have gender equality as
  a component by 2030, though it does not need to be the main focus. David
  Lammy, the foreign secretary, told MPs last month that he could not “commit to
  decisions made by the last government” and it was “for us to look at this
  afresh”. The government spent £15.3bn in aid in 2023, the latest year for
  which final figures are available. Of this, £10bn was bilateral aid spent
  directly on projects in developing countries, rather than multilateral
  institutions such as the UN. Provisional figures suggest the UK’s aid spending
  fell to £14.1bn in 2024, an 8% decrease on the previous year, with £11.3bn
  going to bilateral aid. A government impact assessment said in July that the
  government’s aid cuts meant that in Africa – which receives half of the UK’s
  bilateral aid – spending was being reduced in women’s health and emergency
  response in countries including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zimbabwe
  and Mozambique. The assessment warned that “reductions to health spending risk
  an increase in disease burden and ultimately in deaths, impacting in
  particular those living in poverty, women, children and people with
  disabilities”. It said there would be cuts to girls’ education programmes in
  countries including Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria and to projects
  encouraging women’s participation in peace processes, with conflicts including
  Ukraine and Sudan supported at a reduced scale. Critics warned that scrapping
  the 80% commitment could compound the impact of the US and UK aid cuts and
  exacerbate what feels like “a global war on women”. Labour has promised to
  prioritise women and girls in government including by promoting sexual and
  reproductive health and rights abroad, and tackling gender-based violence.
  Harriet Harman, the former acting Labour leader, was appointed UK special
  envoy for women and girls in March 2025. Sarah Champion, the Labour chair of
  the international aid committee, said: “The UK’s commitments to women and
  girls are not just words on a page, they’re a lifeline that gives hope to some
  of the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet. “The Trump administration
  immediately cut all international maternal and reproductive health support,
  and just last month, burned contraception it had bought for low-income
  countries. Now is the time for the UK to step up our commitment to gender
  programming, not step away. “When we look at conflicts, climate impact and
  nutrition it is always women and girls who bear the brunt. Our aid programming
  gives them hope and opportunities in what feels like a global war on women. We
  can’t take that away from them now.” Alex Farley, a policy manager at Bond,
  the UK network for NGOs, said that “at a time when women’s rights globally are
  under attack and the US has been gutting all gender equality and diversity
  programming, it’s definitely very worrying to see the UK following suit.”
  “Gender equality programming has already been put at disproportionate risk in
  the government’s cuts to UK aid. Upholding the 80% commitment, alongside
  stand-alone gender programmes, is really important for the UK to send a signal
  showing that it’s committed to tackling gender inequality rather than stepping
  back.” Amelia Whitworth, head of policy, campaigns and youth at Plan
  International UK, said: “Anti-gender movements are growing, humanitarian and
  climate crises are intensifying, and girls and women are being hit hardest. In
  a world where girls’ rights are being rolled back, the UK has to hold the
  line. “With USAID slashing over 80% of its programmes – including funding for
  gender and DEI initiatives – and European donors retreating, the need for the
  UK to uphold its gender equality commitments has never been greater.” A
  Foreign Office spokesperson confirmed that the government was “carefully
  reviewing the viability of existing commitments” after cutting aid spending to
  0.3%. “As the foreign secretary has said, women and girls are a fundamental
  priority,” the spokesperson said. “From appointing a dedicated special envoy
  for women and girls to improving energy access for 15 million women worldwide,
  the UK has demonstrated how integrating gender equality into its international
  work can transform lives. We will continue to champion the rights of women and
  girls globally and ensure that gender equality is embedded across all the
  department’s priorities.”
