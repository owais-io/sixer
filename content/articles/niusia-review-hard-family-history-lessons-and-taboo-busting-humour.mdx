  This story, told by Beth Paterson, is about her “nanna Niusia … and I remember
  her as a bitch”. It is quite the statement about her 86-year-old grandmother
  whom she was taken to visit as a teenager, when all she wanted to do was go to
  the movies. To Paterson, Niusia was an old curmudgeon full of complaints and
  cruelties. But she proceeds to take us on the journey that she went on after
  Niusia’s death, when she became curious about who her Polish immigrant
  grandmother had been before settling in Melbourne. It turns out that she had
  been Holocaust survivor, although, typically for one who had lived through its
  trauma, she rarely talked about the time “before”. Under the direction of her
  collaborator Kat Yates, Paterson excavates her grandmother’s past, beginning
  with her successful businesses in Melbourne, which she singlehandedly built.
  But the drama then spools back to the beginning: her birth in Warsaw in 1922,
  her ambitions to become a doctor before her imprisonment in Auschwitz and,
  chillingly, the medical work she was forced to do under the Nazi eugenicist
  Josef Mengele. Patterson’s attitude toward Niusia changes after the airing of
  these memories, sourced through her mother, whose voice we hear in recordings.
  This is a surprisingly warm play given its theme of the Holocaust and
  inherited trauma. Paterson is a sweet, perky storyteller, singing at times and
  incorporating her play-making process into her narration. Sometimes this seems
  pertinent, other times unnecessary. She brings some taboo-busting humour to
  the subject, which also only half works. It defuses the tension but sounds
  like random lines from an edgy standup routine. There are life lessons for
  Paterson along the way, which she speaks aloud, recommending books that are in
  brown boxes and which she reaches for at various moments. It is clear that the
  disinterring of personal history is part of an education – one she now imparts
  to us. The narrative strays from Niusia towards the end, on to Paterson’s
  Australian Jewish identity and the anxiety of not being seen as Jewish enough
  – which could make for a play of its own. It is ultimately Niusia’s story that
  grips. Paterson puts on an accent to bring her back to life. We hear that she
  went on to have twins after leaving the camp. As Paterson says, isn’t that the
  best “fuck you” to Mengele? Quite. • At Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August
