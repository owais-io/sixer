  A British brother and sister, aged 11 and 13, have drowned after getting into
  difficulties while swimming at Salou, a popular Mediterranean resort in
  north-eastern Spain. Their father, who ran into the sea to rescue them,
  survived. Emergency services were called to the scene on the Platja Llarga
  next to the Hotel Negresco shortly before 9pm on Tuesday. Although all three
  were alive when they were brought ashore, emergency workers, among them police
  and firefighters, were unable to revive the boy and girl. Reports indicate
  that they were swimming in a rocky area about 100 metres from the beach, but
  heavy seas prevented them from returning to shore. The children’s father
  attempted to rescue them, before having to be rescued himself. The tragedy
  occurred hours after a 54-year-old German tourist drowned nearby on the beach
  at Cambrils. Salou held a minute of silence at 11.45 today in memory of the
  victims, whose identities have not yet been released by police. A UK Foreign,
  Commonwealth and Development Office spokesperson said: “We are supporting the
  family of two British children who have died in Spain and are in contact with
  the local authorities.” Spanish beaches are flagged green, yellow or red,
  depending on the state of the sea and the strength of the currents. In both
  Salou and Cambrils the yellow flag indicated that bathers, and children in
  particular, should be cautious. Oliver Klein, the mayor of Cambrils, said he
  was “profoundly saddened by the loss of life on our coasts”, adding that the
  beaches were safe and well-supervised. “That said, I wish to appeal to
  bathers’ responsibility. It’s essential to pay attention to the flags and the
  advice of the lifeguards. The flags aren’t just advisory, they are there to
  save lives,” Klein said. Sixteen people have drowned on Catalan beaches since
  15 June, five more than over the same period last year. A further three have
  drowned in swimming pools. In June, a two-year-old British boy drowned in a
  private swimming pool in Ibiza, while later that month, a four-year-old
  drowned in a pool in Mijas on the Costa del Sol. Last week, a three-year-old
  girl drowned in a pool in Alicante in south-east Spain. On average, about 350
  people die by drowning in Spain each year, the majority on unsupervised
  beaches or in rivers. • This article was amended on 31 July 2025. An earlier
  version incorrectly said the siblings were two boys, rather than a boy and a
  girl.
