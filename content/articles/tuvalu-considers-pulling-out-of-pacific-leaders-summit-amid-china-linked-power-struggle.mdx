  Tuvalu’s prime minister Feletei Teo said his country may pull out of the
  region’s top political meeting next month, after host nation Solomon Islands
  moved to block all external partners – including China, US and Taiwan – from
  attending. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting will be held in Honiara
  in September. On 7 August, Solomon Islands prime minister Jeremiah Manele told
  parliament that no dialogue partners would be invited to the annual gathering.
  Countries outside the Pacific, known as “dialogue partners,” have attended the
  forum since 1989, to work with Pacific leaders and contribute to discussions
  around development and regional security. While not an official partner,
  Taiwan has attended the meetings as a “development partner” for more than
  three decades. The decision by Honiara, a close ally of Beijing, has fuelled
  speculation the move was aimed at keeping Taiwan out of the meeting. It has
  raised questions over China’s growing sway in Pacific diplomacy and whether
  regional unity can hold. Tuvalu, along with the Marshall Islands and Palau,
  are the only Pacific countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, in
  what Beijing views as an affront to its One China principle. In an interview
  with the Guardian, Teo said he would wait to see how other Pacific leaders
  respond before deciding whether or not to attend the forum next month,
  expressing “disappointment” at the last-minute exclusion of external
  countries. “The region does not need these kinds of distractions,” Teo said.
  “We have far more important issues to focus on, rather than letting ourselves
  be pressured from outside.” Teo said he had written to Manele outlining
  concerns around the inconvenient timing of the decision, and his “difficulties
  supporting the justification” behind the move. “We’ll … see what the rest of
  the leaders’ response is to the proposal by the Solomons, and then we’ll make
  our decision,” he said. “I’ll wait for the final decision on this arrangement,
  and then reconsider my participation,” he said. The annual forum is the main
  mechanism through which leaders define region-wide policy agendas. Teo added
  he “won’t be surprised” if China was behind the decision to block partners
  from the forum, saying the unusual move broke with decades of precedent in the
  region. “There is no denying that China is trying to extend its footprint in
  the Pacific, and so is the US,” Teo said. “My own personal view is that we do
  need their development assistance, but we do not need the competition and
  conflict overshadowing our development agenda in the Pacific.” The Guardian
  contacted China’s embassy in Honiara for comment. A US state department
  spokesperson said Washington was “disappointed” by the move to exclude
  partners, and reaffirmed support for the attendance of all partners, including
  Taiwan, at the forum. “All [forum] partners, and that includes Taiwan, should
  be invited to participate … regardless of where it is hosted – just as
  countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan invite all dialogue
  partners, including China,” the spokesperson said. Taiwan said it “urges that
  that existing arrangements be maintained”, adding that its participation at
  the Pacific meetings would “further strengthen cooperation”. Not all of
  Taiwan’s Pacific allies have opposed the decision to exlude foreign attenders
  to the forum. Palau, which will host the forum in 2026, says it “respects and
  acknowledges” Solomon Islands’ decision to block all foreign attendees, with
  the office of the president saying it allows members “to focus on the critical
  intra-regional issues at this year’s forum”. Solomon Islands switched
  diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China in 2019 and three years later, the
  countries signed a controversial security pact . Honiara has also received
  significant Chinese funding, including a recent $US1m donation to buy 27 cars
  to transport delegates during the forum. Dr Sarina Theys, senior lecturer in
  diplomacy and international affairs at the University of the South Pacific,
  said Solomon Islands’ decision may be an attempt to avoid openly choosing
  between China and Taiwan. “The only way to do that is then to just not invite
  anyone,” Theys said. Niuone Eliuta, first secretary at the Tuvalu High
  Commission in New Zealand, said he had “no doubt China is behind this
  decision” to block external partners from the upcoming forum. “This day and
  age China is very much influencing what’s going on in the Pacific,” Eliuta
  said, adding that excluding donor partners could mean countries miss out on
  vital support such as climate funding. “This is a temporary fix, moving
  development dialogue partners out of the Solomon Islands,” Eliuta said. “I
  just hope no countries break away from PIF.” Concerns over Beijing’s influence
  on the Forum are not new. At last year’s meeting in Tonga, segments of the
  Pacific leader’s communique that referenced Taiwan were altered, a decision
  many believe to be an outcome of China’s influence. In 2022, two Chinese
  defence attaches were ejected from the Forum’s meeting in Suva while caught
  listening to a visual address given by US vice-president Kamala Harris.
