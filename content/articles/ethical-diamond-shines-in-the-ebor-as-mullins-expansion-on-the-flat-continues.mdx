  Patrick Mullins, son and assistant to his father, Willie, spoke at length
  after their latest success in the Grand National in April about the champion
  jumps trainer’s insatiable need to keep pressing on. The stable’s steady
  expansion into the top staying handicaps on the Flat continued on Saturday as
  Ethical Diamond, the 5-1 favourite, came home an impressive
  two-and-a-half-length winner of the Ebor, Europe’s richest Flat handicap. The
  simple fact seems to be that there is now such a wealth of equine talent in
  Mullins’s County Carlow yard that it would be a waste to direct it solely
  towards the winter code. He is, after all, the reigning champion over jumps in
  Ireland – where he has been unchallenged for nearly two decades – and Britain,
  since 2024. The Flat can also prove educational for a horse such as Ethical
  Diamond who, Mullins admitted, had been something of a puzzle since arriving
  in the yard in late 2023. “We’ve just been trying to find the right tactics
  that suit him, it’s taken me 18 months to do that and now he’s won at Royal
  Ascot [in the Duke Of Edinburgh Stakes in June] and the Ebor,” Mullins said.
  “Now that we have a way to ride him, he’d probably win a nice race over
  hurdles, I think tactics have been the making of him. “Winning races on the
  Flat like this gives me exactly the same buzz as winning big races over jumps,
  for sure. To come here and win races like this, it’s why you do the game.” The
  Melbourne Cup – a race where Mullins has come up agonisingly short in the past
  – is not an option for Ethical Diamond after treatment for an injury earlier
  in his career, but the gelding still has valuable targets under both codes.
  “He won’t go to Melbourne as he won’t pass the vets in Australia, so we wiped
  that off straight away,” Mullins said. “He’s got a screw in his leg from an
  old injury and that is a straight no-no from them. “I don’t know if he’s an
  Irish Cesarewitch horse or we let him run in an Irish Leger, we’ll have to see
  but I’d definitely like to move him up in grade to a Group Two or a Group
  Three at some stage.” Earlier, Andrew Balding completed a double worth nearly
  £500,000 as Tarriance (5-1) edged out Many Men (9-2 fav) in the Melrose
  Handicap before Never So Brave, a recruit to the yard after Sir Michael
  Stoute’s retirement at the end of 2024, took the first running of the City Of
  York Stakes as a Group One event. Rosallion, who had looked to be an unlucky
  loser behind Qirat, the shock 150-1 winner, in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood
  last time, was the even-money favourite for the City Of York, but raced wide
  and could not pick up the leaders over the furlong shorter trip as Never So
  Brave took over at the furlong pole and stayed on well to the line. Never So
  Brave was racing in handicap company two months ago, albeit at Royal Ascot
  where he put up an exceptional performance to win the Buckingham Palace Stakes
  under 9st 12lb, but is now confirmed as a Group One horse and could step back
  up to a mile for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day at Ascot in
  October. In Ireland, Aidan O’Brien extended his remarkable domination of the
  Futurity Stakes at the Curragh as the odds-on chance Constitution River gave
  the trainer his 18th victory in the Group Two contest. O’Brien’s previous
  winners of the race include subsequent Classic winners Giant’s Causeway, Hawk
  Wing, Gleneagles and Henri Matisse. Constitution River, who was cut to 14-1
  for next year’s 2,000 Guineas by Paddy Power, is now likely to head to the
  Group One National Stakes at the Curragh next month.
