  Patrick Dorgu has defended Ruben Amorim’s 3-4-3 formation by pointing to how
  its fluidity allows Manchester United tactical flexibility. Amorim has
  attracted scrutiny for his rigid adherence to the formation but Dorgu defended
  his manager’s stance, making the point that United’s shape does change
  in-game. “It depends what system you’re playing against,” the wing-back said.
  “You can always drop alongside the centre-backs to make it a 4-3-3. It’s about
  adapting to who you’re playing against and helping each other, move for each
  other, and then it’s not really about the system. It’s more like how you’re
  dealing with it.” Dorgu, speaking before Sunday’s draw at Fulham, expanded on
  the formation’s fluidity. “It’s up to you how you want to play,” he said. “If
  the midfielders feel like they’re getting man-marked, then they can move down,
  get the ball, and play. You need to move. Obviously, you’re not just going to
  move around [anywhere]. I can’t just run to the right side, but you can move
  in your position.” The United hierarchy’s target is a return to European
  competition after a campaign in which the club finished 15th and lost in the
  final of the Europa League. Dorgu, who joined from Lecce for €30m in February,
  is bullish about their prospects, however. “We are aiming to win the Premier
  League,” said the 20-year-old Denmark international. “We are Manchester
  United, so that’s always going to be our goal – 100%. We just need to take it
  game by game.” United has signed Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus
  Cunha this summer and Dorgu is intent on forming a partnership along the left
  flank withCunha. “I feel like he’s really good at driving with the ball,
  getting past players, and with my runs and what I can do, this will help him
  to do that,” said Dorgu. “Cunha talks a lot and he’s really funny, he tries to
  engage with everyone so it’s easier to talk with him because he has a lot of
  energy.”
