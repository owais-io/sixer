  At 21, I was floating through life with few concrete plans or aspirations. I
  had a part-time job at a sneaker shop in Potts Point and spent most of my
  shifts gazing idly out the window. In December 2011, a woman I’d never seen
  before wandered past. I was instantly drawn to this coolness she exuded, but
  as she walked on by I figured that was it, I’d never see her again. A few
  minutes later, she came back from the other direction and walked right in.
  Later, I’d learn she had noticed me too and had come back for a closer look,
  but at the time I was oblivious, far more worried about how I’d shoot my shot
  now she was right in front of me. She was really friendly and asked about a
  very specific pair of shoes. We didn’t have her size and I knew we’d never
  stock them again, but I went through the motions of taking down her details
  anyway. There was definitely a little vibe, and as it turned out we were both
  using the same goofy tactics to maximise our exposure to each other. She had
  no interest in the shoes. As we chatted, Sam told me she lived nearby and was
  opening her own shop just a few doors down. I felt like such a kid in the
  company of this sophisticated business woman. A few weeks later, when her shop
  opened I casually popped in to say hello. Before long I was dropping off
  coffees in the morning and wandering down on every cigarette break in the hope
  that if I just hung around enough something might happen. On Christmas Eve she
  invited me over to her place. I can remember having to concoct some story to
  get out of dinner at my parent’s so I could spend the evening listening to
  music and polishing off a bottle of rum with a girl I was besotted with. We
  kissed that night, but much to my disappointment, I was quickly relegated to
  the friend zone. I sort of accepted that I would probably just have this crush
  forever or, if I was lucky, eventually my omnipresence would spark a romantic
  interest in her. We saw each other virtually every day for six months and were
  texting and chatting on the phone constantly, but I still wasn’t getting any
  closer to making her fall in love with me. Then one day I was headed to work
  and noticed a sign on her shop saying it was closed due health reasons. I’d
  just run into Sam at an Aphex Twin concert the night before so I knew
  something was off. There was a number on the note, so I texted it just to
  check if everything was OK. It turned out she’d been in a serious car wreck.
  The desperation I felt for her to be alright was overwhelming and it was in
  that moment I realised my feelings went well beyond a boyish infatuation. It
  would be weeks before I heard from Sam and got the full picture. It turned out
  Sam had consumed a substance at the concert that wasn’t what she thought it
  was. The accident had happened as she tried to drive herself to safety in a
  panic. In my own way, I made it clear I had all the time and energy in the
  world to help her recover and over the following few months we slowly became a
  couple. While Sam’s physical injuries were pretty serious, the psychological
  and judicial fallout from the accident was immense. It was a life-altering
  event for Sam and, by extension, me. The whole saga dragged on for over five
  years. As draining and full-on as it all was, it definitely brought us closer
  together and gave us both a chance to really see and feel the lengths we’d
  both go to to support one another. As the dark clouds of the accident began to
  disperse we moved to Melbourne and started making music together. We took off
  to London in 2019, then moved on to Berlin where we’ve built our music careers
  and a family at the same time. The feelings I had for Sam from that very first
  encounter were so pure and so deep it really felt fated. No one had ever made
  me feel more comfortable in myself. And I still feel exactly the same. Just
  being around her, no matter what is going on always just feels right and safe.
  There’s no doubt she’s brought out the best in me and made room for so many
  parts of me to grow and expand that might have otherwise lain dormant. To meet
  someone whose light shines on you in that way is out of this world. Tom
  McAlister (Big Ever) and Samantha Poulter (Logic1000) are performing at
  Melbourne’s Now or Never festival, running 21-31 August 2025
